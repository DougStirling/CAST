<p class="heading">Advantages of downloading</p>
<p>We encourage all users to download CAST and run it from a local hard disk, file server or web server.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CAST can be slow when run from our server in New Zealand.</li>
  <li>Running CAST from a local copy reduces the load on our web server.</li>
  <li>A downloaded copy can be used on a computer without an internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even more important is that the interactive and dynamic diagrams that are a core part of CAST are currently not supported by some web browsers and will eventually stop working in others.</p>
<p class="heading">Downloading and installing</p>
<p>The NCEA collection of CAST e-books is provided as a <a id="zipInstaller2" name="cast_for_ncea_installer.zip">compressed 'zip' file</a>. Clicking this link downloads a file called &quot;cast_for_ncea_installer.zip&quot;. You should now copy this file from your default Downloads folder to where you want CAST to be installed — your Desktop may be the most convenient place.</p>
<p>How to extract CAST from this file depends on your operating system.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Windows</dt>
	<dd>Right-click the zip file then select the command <strong>Extract all</strong> from the popup menu that appears. You will be asked where you want CAST installed. This creates a folder called CAST on your hard disk containing all of CAST. (Note that simply double-clicking the zip file will show you the files that are in it, but will <strong>not</strong> extract them in a form that allows CAST to be used — you must use the <strong>Extract all</strong> command.)</dd>
	<dt>Macintosh</dt>
	<dd>On a Mac, simply double-click the zip file; CAST will be expanded into a folder called CAST in the same location as the zip file.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In both cases, you will be left with a folder called CAST on your hard disk. The zip file itself can now be deleted.</p>
<p class="heading">Java</p>
<p>You will need to install Java support on your computer, both to run the stand-alone version of CAST and also to get access to the interactive diagrams in the browser-based version.You should go to Oracle's <a href="http://java.com">main 
	Java web site</a> and make sure that you have the most recent version of Java installed.</p>
<p class="heading">Running CAST from a downloaded copy</p>
<p>At the top level of your installed CAST folder, you should see  a file called &quot;Start_CAST.jar&quot;. If Java support has been installed, double-clicking this file should start the stand-alone version CAST.</p>
<p>If you want to keep using the browser-based version of CAST (not recommended), you can double-click the file called &quot;collection_ncea.html&quot;; this should show this version of CAST in your default browser. (It will be identical to the window that you are currently viewing unless it is a newer release of CAST).</p>
