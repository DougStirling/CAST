<p class=heading>Analysis of variation</p>

  <p>In earlier pages of this section, we have treated unexplained variation in 
		data as 'noise' &mdash; a nuisance that cannot be avoided and that only serves 
		to complicate the analysis of data.</p>
	<p>This is not totally true. Variation can be interesting in its own right, 
		especially when we are interested in predicting the future.</p>

		<p>The table below shows the maximum daily temperatures (in degrees Celsius) 
			at Kabete, Kenya during one month.</p>

		<p>From a data set such as this, we might get information about the chance 
			that the temperature will be under 20.0 degrees in a future June day.</p>
		<hr width="75%">
		<p>For countries that are susceptible to drought, the variability in past 
			weather records might give information about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The chance of rain at different times in the year.</li>
			<li>The chance that annual rainfall will be less than 200 mm.</li>
			<li>The chance of rain being so late that crops will fail.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This information can potentially help farmers decide which crops to plant 
			and when to plant them.</p>

  <p class=heading>Extreme values and outliers</p>

  <p>There is often useful information in the <strong>extreme</strong> values 
		in a data set &mdash; the highest and lowest values for each variable. If they 
		are unusual enough, these extreme values are called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
	<p>It is always worth investigating outliers further. They may be values that 
		were wrongly recorded, but sometimes further investigation can give more important 
		information.</p>

		<p class=heading>Crop yields</p>
	  <p>Consider data that have been collected about the yields of maize in a sample 
			of farms in a region. The farm reporting the highest yield may be worth 
			further investigation. Is its higher yield caused by:</p>
		
		
	<ul>
		<li>Better soil?</li>
		<li>Better farming practices?</li>
		<li>Use of a different variety of maize?</li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>Some of these findings could lead to improved yields elsewhere.</p>
