<p class="heading">Some applications</p>

  <p>Some scenarios are presented below where estimating a population proportion 
		or mean (using a corresponding sample statistic) is justified.</p>

    <p class=heading>HIV infection rates</p>
    <p>Researchers in the late 1980s were interested in the HIV infection rates 
			of homosexual men in the USA and collected data from a sample of 4,955 homosexual 
			men in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh.</p>
		<center>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
      <tr> 
          <td><strong>The sample proportion, <em>p</em>, of homosexual men with 
						HIV is an estimate of the unknown population proportion, π.</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
    <p>It was found that 1,883 out of the 4,955 sampled homosexual men were infected 
			with the HIV virus, so our estimate of the proportion infected out of <strong>all</strong> 
			homosexual men in these four cities is</p>

    <p class=heading>Ewes per farm in region</p>
    <p>An official from the Ministry of Agriculture wants to estimate the average 
			number of ewes in a region's farms that are available for lambing in the 
			spring. The official knows that there are 3,535 farms in the region but 
			collecting information from all farms would be very expensive, so data are 
			collected from a random sample of 100 farms.</p>
    <center>
			<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
				<tr> 
					<td><strong>The sample mean number of ewes per farm, <em><img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"></em>, 
						is an estimate of the unknown population mean, </strong>µ<strong>.</strong></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</center>
		<p>There was a total of 26,360 ewes in the 100 sampled farms, so the mean 
			number of ewes per farm was 263.6. We <strong>estimate</strong> the average 
			number of ewes per farm in the <strong>whole</strong> region to be</p>

			263.6 <em>ewes</em></p>
		
		<p class=heading>Total number of ewes in region</p>
		<p>The sample data can also be used to estimate the <strong>total</strong> 
			number of ewes in the region. We estimate the total for all 3,535 farms 
			in the region to be</p>
		<p class=eqn>263.6 <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">x</font> 
			3,535&nbsp;= &nbsp;931,826&nbsp;<em>ewes</em></p>

		<p class=heading>Comparing beers</p>

<p>A brewery wishes to assess the effect of an additive on the alcohol content of its
premium beer. Several batches are brewed, both with and without the additive, and the
alcohol content of each batch is recorded. We therefore have two random samples; one
from a hypothetical population of alcohol contents of batches brewed with the additive,
and the other from the corresponding hypothetical population without the additive.
</p>

<p>We could estimate the two population distributions and attempt to compare them. However
the brewer's interest is mostly about whether the alcohol content increases or decreases
with the additive, and this can be phrased in terms of the two population means
-- are they different?
</p>

</p>

    <p>The sample means provide estimates of the corresponding population means 
			and are the basis for answering the question. </p>
