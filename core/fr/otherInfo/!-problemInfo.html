	<dt class="bigger">Java</dt>
  <dd>The interactive diagrams in CAST are implemented with the Java language
 and environment and this must be installed on your computer before they can be seen. When you start any CAST e-book, the installed version of Java is checked. CAST
needs a fairly recent version of Java and you <span class="red bold">must</span>  
    install Java from the <a href="http://java.com">Oracle's Java web site</a> if
the initial check reports that it is needed.<br>
</dd>

<dl>
  <dt class="bigger">Java security settings</dt>
<dd>In recent operating systems, the default security settings for
Java have been tightened and these often need to be modified. Specific advice about the settings for your browser and operating system are shown when you start any CAST e-book. Unfortunately the latest release of Google Chrome no longer supports Java, so the interactive diagrams in CAST no longer work with it.</dd>
<dt class="bigger">Browsers</dt>
  <dd>CAST  needs a fairly recent web browser, so it is recommended that
you upgrade to the latest release of your browser. CAST works 
with the latest releases of Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer, but not Chrome since it no longer supports Java.<br>
<br>
We have found that Firefox and Safari are the most stable browsers
so we recommend them.</dd>
