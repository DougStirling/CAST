<h1 align="center" class="darkblue">Recent changes to CAST</h1>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="16">
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 5.6</strong><br>
		16th August 2015</td>
	<td>The video lectures for the introductory business statistics e-book were updated and a few bugs were fixed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 5.5</strong><br>
		11th July 2015</td>
	<td> The user-interface was modernised with more subtle colours. The video versions of pages in the introductory general and bio-statistics e-books were updated as single video lectures. Summary pages were added to the mathematical statistics e-book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 5.4</strong><br>
		20th Nov 2014</td>
	<td> Video versions of pages were added to the introductory business statistics and bio-statistics e-books. A new e-book about mathematical statistics was added. Many data sets in the introductory e-books were updated to more recent ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 5.3</strong><br>
		20th Dec 2013</td>
	<td> Added video versions of pages in general introductory e-book. A &quot;manager&quot; program that is included with downloaded copies of CAST applies updates and simplifies creation of customised e-books.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 5.2</strong><br>
		13th Dec 2011</td>
	<td> The main change in release 5.2 is the addition of summary versions of all
pages in the introductory CAST e-books. Tabs that extend into the banner switch
between full and summary versions. Complete chapters in full or summary format
can be printed from a new icon at the right of the banner. Changes to the underlying
CAST framework make translation easier and give better compatibility with Chrome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 5.1</strong><br>
		20th July 2011</td>
	<td> Release 5.1 completed the restructuring of CAST's underlying framework to make it easier to do customisation and translation. Work has begun on translating an introductory e-book into two different languages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 5.0</strong><br>
		7th Feb 2011</td>
	<td> The main changes in this release were in the framework underlying CAST to make it easier for others to create customised and translated CAST e-books. Although the changes were extensive, they had very minor impact on the e-books from the users' perspective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 4.2</strong><br>
		26th Oct 2010</td>
	<td> There were few changes in this release. A few exercises were added (about time series and hypothesis testing), a section was added about index numbers and there were a couple of extra pages about hypothesis testing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 4.1</strong><br>
		2nd March 2010</td>
	<td> A new e-book about design and analysis of experiments for agriculture and biology was added. The e-book about industrial experiments was also improved. There were no significant changes to the other e-books.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 4.0</strong><br>
		11th Nov 2009</td>
	<td> A more modern and simpler user-interface starts CAST. The requirements to register an email address and login with a PIN code were finally abandoned. An extra chapter of exercises was added about standard errors and confidence intervals. The lecturing e-books were  rewritten to only display the interactive diagrams; usage notes can be shown with a mouse click and it is possible to display pages (without banner or table of contents) directly from PowerPoint presentations. Alternative versions  can be displayed from a menu at the top left  of many pages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    
<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 3.5</strong><br>
15th Nov 2008</td>
<td> A new <em>Exercises</em> e-book was added to this release. It contains exercises 
about descriptive and exploratory statistics; exercises about inference will be 
added in a later release. The startup procedure is also simpler and CAST tries 
to remember PIN codes from one use to the next.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 3.4</strong><br>
      10th Oct 2007</td>
		
    <td> The main changes to CAST in this version have been cosmetic. In all interactive 
      diagrams, the buttons, checkboxes, scrollbars and sliders now match those 
      of the operating system (Windows, Macintosh, etc.) that is used. The old 
      4-digit PIN codes have been replaced by 5-digit ones and these must be renewed 
      every 6 months. However CAST can now be run without an internet connection 
      and the login procedure works well with all browsers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 3.3</strong><br>
      10th Aug 2007</td>
		
    <td> A new <em>Multiple Regression</em> e-book was added, based on <em>Advanced 
      CAST</em> from release 3.2, but without most of the theory and expanded 
      to include full GLMs with matrix notation for the models. An <em>Experimental 
      Design</em> e-book was also added, aimed mostly at industrial experiments. 
      There were various improvements to the main CAST e-books, especially about 
      standard errors, percentiles, lurking variables and the presentation of 
      tables.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
		<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 3.2</strong><br>
			1st Dec 2006</td>
		
    <td> In the main CAST versions, new material was added about standard errors, 
      including bootstrap estimation of error distributions. The section about 
      normal distributions was improved and a section about analysis of randomised 
      block designs was added, including multiple comparisons. In <em>Advanced 
      CAST</em>, three sections of a new chapter about general linear models were 
      written.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
		<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 3.1</strong><br>
			17th Feb 2006</td>
		<td> In the main CAST versions, the introduction chapter was expanded and 
			improved. A section about percentiles was added and the standard deviation 
			pages were improved. In <em>Advanced CAST</em>, a new section about regression 
			diagnostics was added and packaged with regression anova into chapter 2. 
			A third chapter was added covering multiple regression with two explanatory 
			variables. The free internet-login version now supports the Safari and Firefox 
			browsers. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 3.0</strong><br>
1st Feb 2005</td>
<td> There were few changes to the main introductory CAST versions in this release. 
However a new version containing advances statistical methods has been started. 
<em>Advanced CAST</em> currently contains a single chapter that teaches about 
Analysis of Variance, including distributions and inference about a single variance.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 2.6</strong><br>
1st Sept 2004</td>
<td> The material in the old Comparing Groups chapter was revised and split into 
a new Comparing Two Groups chapter and an Anova chapter into which the regression 
anova material was also moved. The Contingency Tables chapter was also expanded 
and renamed Independence. Business versions of these chapters were also added. 
A few improvements were also made to the first chapter (mainly about Stem and 
Leaf plots and Standard Deviation).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 2.5</strong><br>
7th May 2004</td>
<td> The Regression Models and Inference chapter was rewritten and expanded for 
release 2.5 (and a Business version of the chapter was created). A section about 
regression diagnostics was added and the analysis of variance section was expanded 
considerably. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 2.4</strong><br>
31st Dec 2003</td>
<td> The Experimental Design chapter was rewritten and expanded with greater coverage 
of lurking variables and simple experimental designs, including completely randomised, 
randomised block, factorial designs, interaction, linear factor effects and least 
squares estimation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 2.3</strong><br>
3rd July 2003</td>
<td> The Inference chapter was substantially revised and split into Estimation 
and Hypothesis Testing chapters. Business versions of them were created.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="TOP" class="darkblue"><strong>Release 2.2</strong><br>
13th March 2003</td>
<td> Major rewrites of the Categorical and Sampling Distributions chapters, and 
Business versions of them created. Control chart material from release 1.3 added

<td>
	New initial screen; clicking 'Continue' runs CAST in a new window
	without toolbar or other adornments at the top.
