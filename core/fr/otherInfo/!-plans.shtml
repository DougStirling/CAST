<h1 align="center" class="darkblue">Future plans for CAST</h1>
<h3 class="darkblue">Main introductory CAST e-books</h3>
<p>There are now video versions of all pages in the three introductory statistics e-books. I intend to revise these video pages before the next release of CAST.</p>
<h3 class="darkblue">Exercises</h3>
<p><em>CAST</em> contains an e-book of exercises but more are needed for the later topics in the introductory e-books.</p>
<h3 class="darkblue">Advanced e-books</h3>
<p>Release 5.5 of <em> CAST</em> contains advanced e-books on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple regression and general linear models</li>
  <li>Design and analysis of experiments in agriculture and biology</li>
  
<li>Design and analysis of industrial experiments</li>
<li>Mathematical statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary versions of the pages in the e-books about regression and experiments would be useful.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, it is also hoped to write an e-book about <strong>multivariate
 methods</strong> &mdash; the CAST approach has considerable potential for explaining
them in a non-mathematical way.</p>
<p>It is also hoped to write an e-book about <strong>official statistics</strong>. A single chapter has been written at this stage about data presentation in tables, graphs and maps &mdash; it is included as an 'e-booklet' rather than an e-book. It is hoped to extend this 
e-book with chapters about topics such as index numbers, demography, time series, 
surveys and national accounts.</p>
<p><strong>These developments are dependent on funding.</strong></p>
<h3 class="darkblue">Customisation and translation</h3>
<p>The introductory CAST e-books have now been restructured to make translation
into other languages easier. Projects have started to translate introductory
CAST e-books into German and Spanish, with a French translation also in the pipeline.
Volunteers to help with these or other translations are welcome.</p>
<p>Creation of customised e-books is now also possible. Hopefully others will contribute to the project by uploading customised e-books to be shared more widely.</p>
