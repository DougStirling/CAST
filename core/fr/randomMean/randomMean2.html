<p class="heading">Distribution of the sample mean</p>

<p>All summaries of sample data, graphical and numerical, vary from sample to 
sample. The most widely used summary statistic is a sample's mean, so this section 
describes the variability of sample means.</p>
<p>A <strong>single</strong> value that is sampled from a population has a distribution 
that is described by the population distribution. When a random sample of <em>n</em> 
values is sampled, the sample mean is also random, but has a distribution that 
is less variable than the population distribution. (Sample means 'average out' 
the extremes in a sample, so sample means tend to be closer to the centre of the 
population distribution.)</p>

  <div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Simulation</p>
		<p>The following diagram selects random samples of values from a normal population 
			with mean 12 and standard deviation 4. This population distribution would 
			be an appropriate model for various types of data:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Weights (grams) of a strain of mice aged 4 weeks</li>
			<li>Lengths of a variety of potatoes (cm)</li>
			<li>Weekly turnover of a shop ($'000)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The normal population is shown at the top with a random sample of 16 values 
			underneath. </p>

		<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to display different random 
			samples and their means. Observe that the sample means vary from sample 
			to sample &mdash; they have a distribution.</p>
		<p>Now click the checkbox <strong>Accumulate</strong> and take 20 or 30 further 
			samples. The bottom display shows the means from all samples in a stacked 
			dot plot.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The distribution of the sample means is centred on 12, the population 
				mean</li>
			<li>The sample means have lower spread than the individual values.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The second of these points is particularly important.</p>
<p><font color="#666666">You may click on the crosses representing the means in the
lower jittered dot plot; the sample that generated that mean is displayed above. Look
at the samples that gave rise to the highest and lowest means.</font>
