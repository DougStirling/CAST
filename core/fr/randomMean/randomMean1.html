<p class="heading">Sampling mechanism</p>

<p>The mechanism of sampling from a population explains randomness in data.</p>
<p class="eqn"><object data="../FpopSamp/images/samplingHistos.svg" width="428" height="336"></object></p>
<p>However, in practice, there is only a single sample and we must use it to give information about the population. The population is the focus of our attention &mdash; we are rarely interested in the <strong>specific</strong> individuals in our sample and the underlying population is a generalisation of this type of 'individual'.</p>
<p class="eqn"><object data="../FpopSamp/images/samplingHistos2.svg" width="423" height="120"></object></p>
<p class="heading">Parameters and statistics</p>
<p>Instead of trying to fully estimate the population distribution, we usually focus attention on a small number of numerical characteristics &mdash; often only one. Such population characteristics are called <strong> parameters</strong>. The corresponding values from a sample are called <strong>sample statistics</strong> and provide <strong>estimates</strong> of the unknown parameters.</p>
<p>The population mean is often of particular interest and the sample mean provides an estimate of it.</p>
<p class="eqn"><object data="images/sampToPopn.svg" width="423" height="120"></object></p>
<p class="heading">Variability of sample statistics</p>
<p>The variability in random samples also implies sample-to-sample variability in sample statistics.</p>
<p class="eqn"><object data="images/sampToPopn2.svg" width="428" height="336"></object></p>
<p>In order to assess how well a sample statistic  estimates an unknown population parameter, it is important to understand its sample-to-sample variability. </p>

<div class="boxed">
  <p>The remainder of this section investigates the variability in sample means.<br>

<p class="heading">Tread depth of taxi tyres</p>
<p>A taxi company is interested in the tyre tread depth (mm) in the 60 taxis that it owns. These 60 values are the population of interest and their mean and standard deviation are population parameters. The top half of the diagram below shows this population.</p>

<p>To save the cost of measuring the tread depths of all 60 cars, the company decides to randomly select 12 of them (without replacement). Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> to  select a random sample. The sample mean could provide an estimate of the mean tread depth in the whole fleet of taxis (if the population was unknown as it would be in practice).</p>
<p>Observe that the sample mean and standard deviation are similar to those of the population
but they are not identical. Select a few more samples and note the variability in the sample statistics.</p>


<div class="boxed">
  <p>Any single sample mean provides a reasonable estimate of the population mean but the sample-to-sample variability affects its accuracy.<br>
