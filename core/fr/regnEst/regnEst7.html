<p class="heading">What affects the accuracy of the least squares slope?</p>

<p>We gave a formula for the standard deviation of <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> 
earlier in this section. It can be rewritten as</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/regnEst/images/sdSlopeEqn.gif" width="227" height="42"> 
</p>

<p>where
</p>

<ul>
<li>σ 
is the standard deviation of the errors &mdash; i.e. the standard deviation of <i>Y</i> 
around the regression line,</li>
<li><i>n</i> is the number of data points, and</li>
<li><em>s</em><sub>x</sub> 
is the sample standard deviation of <i>X</i>.</li>
</ul>

  
<p>It is interesting to observe how these three quantities influence the accuracy 
of the least squares slope as an estimate of β<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<div class="boxed">
  <p style="text-align:left">The standard error of the least squares slope, <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>, 
    is lowest when: </p>
  <ol>
  <li>the response standard deviation, σ, 
  is low</li>
  <li>the sample size, <i>n</i>, is large</li>
  <li>the spread of x-values is high</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p>The first two influences on accuracy are not surprising but the third needs 
a little more thought.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the data are close to the regression line, then the position of the line 
can be accurately determined.</li>
<li>Increasing the amount of data increases the information about β<sub>1</sub>.</li>
<li>It is easiest to understand the effect of <em>s</em><sub>x</sub> by considering the most extreme situation. If all x-values are the same (<em>s</em><sub>x</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), 
the distribution of <em>Y</em> will also be the same for each and there will be 
<strong>no</strong> information about β<sub>1</sub>. 
If the x-values are similar, the errors will tend to mask any differences in the 
mean response and β<sub>1</sub> will be poorly estimated. The greater the spread of x-values, the smaller the 
errors relative to the difference in response means, so the greater the accuracy 
of the least squares estimates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Use the pull-down menu to alter the sample size. Observe that the spread of the distribution
of <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> is lowest when the sample size is large.</p>

<p>Change the sample size back to 20, then adjust the response standard deviation. Observe
that the spread of the distribution of
  <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> is lowest when the response standard deviation is small.</p>

<p>Change the response standard deviation back to a medium value, then adjust the spread
of <i>X</i>. Observe that the spread of the distribution of
<em>b</em><sub>1</sub> is lowest when the spread of <i>X</i> is high.</p>

<p class=heading>Implications for experimental design
</p>

<p>There are important consequences when designing experiments that will generate 
regression data. In order to increase the accuracy of the estimate of the least 
squares slope,</p>

<dl>
<dt>Reduce the response standard deviation, σ</dt>
<dd>As in other experimental situations, it is best if the experimental units 
are as similar as possible. This is the only way to keep σ low.</dd>
<dt>Increase the sample size</dt>
<dd>Clearly it is best to collect as much data as possible, but expense will be 
a limiting factor.</dd>
<dt>Increase the spread of x-values</dt>
<dd>In an experiment, the x-values are under the control of the experimenter, 
so it is possible to increase their spread.&nbsp; (If there is too small a variation 
in the x-values used in the experiment, β<sub>1</sub> cannot be accurately estimated.)</dd>
</dl>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td align="center"><strong>There is however a major problem when the spread of 
x-values is increased too much.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Beware nonlinearity</font></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Although many relationships are acceptably linear over a limited range of x-values, 
at extreme x-values the relationship often becomes nonlinear. Although a good 
spread of x-values is desirable, the normal linear model is not appropriate if 
there is curvature. A compromise is needed.</p>

</p>
<p>Even when you have decided on a range of x-values that will be used in the 
experiment, it is important to avoid using only values at the two ends of this 
range, even though this maximises <em>s</em><sub>x</sub>. 
Without intermediate values, it is impossible to assess whether the data are linear 
or not.</p>
