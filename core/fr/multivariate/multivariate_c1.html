<p class="heading">Relationships between three or more variables</p>

<p>The relationship between two variables is captured completely by a scatterplot.
However there is no comparable display of three or more variables that clearly expresses their
relationships.
</p>

<p>Various displays have been proposed for multivariate data, each of which extends the
scatterplot in a different way. None of them have the same descriptive power that
a simple scatterplot has for bivariate data but, with experience, they can give some insight
into the relationships between the variables. The pages in this section describe some
such displays.
</p>

  <p class="heading">Use different plotting symbols to represent a third variable</p>
  <p>For data sets that contain <strong>three</strong> numerical variables, the 
		simplest display is based on a scatterplot of two of the variables. The third 
		variable is represented by the use of differing symbols instead of identical 
		'crosses' on the scatterplot. A continuous characteristic of the ploting symbols 
		such as colour, size or angle is often used. </p>
	<table width="75%" border="1" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    <tr>
      <td><strong>The choice of which of the three variables to represent using 
				the plotting symbol is often arbitrary, but can greatly affect how easily 
				the diagram is interpreted.</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Although this kind of scatterplot is easy to draw, it is usually hard to 
		interpret.</p>

		<p class="heading">Managerial salaries</p>

		<p>The personnel department of a large company is examining the salaries of 
			its mid-level executives. The scatterplot below shows the weekly salaries 
			of the 32 executives and their ages. </p>

<p>The number of months that the executives have been employed by the
company is shown by the size of the circle in the scatterplot
(the larger circles represent longer service).

<p>For any specific age, the salary tends to be higher for those who
have had a <strong>shorter</strong> length of employment with the company.
Presumably recent employees have been attracted with higher salaries!
</p>

<p>Select the options <strong>Colour</strong> and <strong>Angle</strong> from
the popup menu to use different characteristics of the plotting symbols to
represent the length of employment.
