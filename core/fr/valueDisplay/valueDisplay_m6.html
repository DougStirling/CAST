<p class="heading">Too many or too few stems</p>

<p>Sometimes a basic stem and leaf plot has
only between 2 and 5 distinct stems. Changing the stem units would give
between 20 and 50 stems &mdash; too many classes to clearly show the density of
values by the heights of the stacks of leaves.
</p>

<div class="diagram">

		<p class="heading">Students failing arithmetic exam</p>

    <p>All children in a country sit a national arithmetic and language exam at 
			the end of the year in which they leave primary school. The two stem and 
			leaf plots below show the percentage of students failing the arithmetic 
			exam in 2007 from each of the 41 primary schools in a region. Each 'leaf' 
			represents the failure rate for one of these schools.</p>
		<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td valign="top"> 
<p>With the leaves as the 'units' digits, most values are stacked on stems '1' 
						and '2'. The stem and leaf plot does not show the shape of the distribution 
						well within the interval 10 to 29 percent.</p>
</td>
				<td> <object data="images/examStemLeaf1.svg" width="173" height="97"></object></td>
			</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"> 
<p>However making the leaves the 'tenths' digits results in too many distinct 
stems for a data set of this size.</p>
					<p>The stem and leaf plot is rather jagged. Also, all leaves are '0' 
						since the percentages were recorded as whole numbers, so there is 
						no advantage over a stacked dot plot.</p>
</td>
				<td> <object data="images/examStemLeaf2.svg" width="172" height="514"></object></td>
			</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p class="heading">Extra flexibility</p>
<p>It is possible to extend the basic stem and leaf plot to display an intermediate 
number of classes (stacks of leaves).</p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Each distinct stem from the basic plot can be split into either 2 
or 5 different classes.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This increases the number of stems by a factor or either 2 or 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the stems are split into two, each stem is listed twice in the stem
	and leaf plot, with leaf values 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 stacked on the lower of the repeats
	and leaves 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 on the higher repeat.</li>
  <li>If the stems are split into five, each stem is listed five times in the stem
	and leaf plot, with leaf values (0 and 1), (2 and 3), (4 and 5), (6 and 7) and (8 and 9)
	on the different repeats of the stem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again the idea is explained more clearly with an example than in words.</p>

<p>Click on the <strong>Animate</strong> button to see the stems split
into two. Note the leaves that end on each stem. The slider can be used
to repeat the animation more slowly.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Split into 5</strong> from the pop-up menu, then repeat the animation.</p>

<p class="heading">Another example</p>

  <div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Storm duration</p>

		<p>In a detailed hydrological study in Malawi, rainfall data were collected 
			from a continuously recording rain gauge installed in Bvumbwe catchment. 
			The durations (minutes) of the first 50 storms in the 1983/4 rainy season 
			are shown below.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="300" height="350">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="stemLeafProg.StemAndLeaf2Applet">
<param name="stemAxis" value="0 2 0 18 2 mins">
<param name="varName" value="Storm duration">
<param name="values" value="85 65 30 385 90 520 885 265 415 5 20 50 125 130 495 135 65 85 35 100 45 40 15 75 100 50 195 160 40 140 40 120 25 10 70 180 45 205 90 145 115 275 45 235 75 60 50 65 40 35">
<param name="discardDigits" value="1">
</applet>
</div>

		<p>The durations ranged between 5 and 885 minutes, so the stems are hundreds 
			and each leaf is the 'tens' digit of a value. Note that the 'units' digits 
			of the values are not shown on the stem and leaf plot. </p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>The stem and leaf provide the most significant digits of each value. 
</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
		<p>Click on the top leaf of '<strong>8</strong>' that is drawn against the 
			stem '<font color="#0000FF"><strong>8</strong></font>' and observe that 
			it corresponds to the value <font color="#0000FF"><strong>8</strong></font><strong>8</strong>5 
			days. Drag with the mouse over other leaves and observe how each storm duration 
			is represented in the diagram. </p>

<p><font color="#666666">(You may notice that the values are not rounded to the 
nearest leaf digit, but are truncated. This is done to simplify drawing the plot 
by hand and should not affect your interpretation of the plot.)</font></p>
