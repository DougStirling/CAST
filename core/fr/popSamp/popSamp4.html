<p class="heading">Effect of sample size on sampling error</p>

<p>The larger the sample size, the smaller the sampling error. However when the 
population is large, sampling a small proportion of the population may still give 
accurate estimates. </p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Sampling error depends much more strongly on the sample size than 
on the proportion of the population that is sampled.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For example, a sample of 10 from a population of 10,000 people will estimate 
the proportion of males almost as accurately as a sample of size 10 from a population 
of 100.</p>

be huge.</strong></td>

 <p class="heading">Shelving for large library books</p>

<p>The manager of a library intends to purchase new shelving for its collection 
and wonders what proportion of its books will fit on shelves with 'standard' spacing. 
Since there are over one million books in the library, it is infeasible to classify 
<strong>all</strong> books as normal or outsize, so the decision on shelving must 
be made from a sample of books.</p>
<p>To investigate how many books must be sampled, we will sample from a population 
of 1,000,000 books in which 20% are outsize.</p>
<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="500" height="190">

<param name="appletName" value="designProg.SamplingTableApplet">

<param name="catLabels" value="Outsize Normal">

</div>

<p>Initially we will take random samples of 1,000 books. Click <strong>Take sample</strong> 
a few times. The difference between the sample proportion of outsize books and 
the population proportion (0.200) is the sampling error. </p>

<p>Use the pop-up menu to investigate how the sample size affects the accuracy
of the estimate. You should observe that the sampling error is usually smaller when
the sample size is large.
</p>

<p>In practice, a sample size of 1000 books would give the library a sufficiently
accurate estimate of the proportion of outsize books. It is certainly hard to
imagine a situation where more than 1% of this population would need to be sampled!</p>
