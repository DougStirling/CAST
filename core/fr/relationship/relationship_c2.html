<p class=heading>Outliers</p>

  <p>The strength of the relationship between two variables is usually the most 
    important information that we gain from a scatterplot. Two other features 
    may however be apparent &mdash; if present, they often provide the most useful 
    information from the data. In this page we examine outliers and in the next, 
    clusters are discussed.</p>
	<p>Sometimes one cross on a scatterplot lies well away from the rest of the 
		scatter of points. Such an observation is called an <strong>outlier</strong>.</p>
	
	<p class="eqn"><object data="images/outliers.svg" width="312" height="157"></object></p>
	
	<p>An outlier may be an extreme value of one or both variables and the outlier 
		may therefore be apparent in the marginal distributions of the variables.</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
	<tr>
		  <td valign="top"><p>However an individual may stand apart from the bulk of 
				the data in a scatterplot <strong>without being an extreme observation 
				for either variable on its own</strong>. Univariate displays of the separate 
				variables may not detect such an outlier.</p></td>

		<p>Our first example is not a business one, but provides a good illustration 
			of an outlier.</p>

		<p class=heading>Brain and body weight</p>

		<p>The scatterplot below shows the brain and body weights of a collection 
			of animals. Since body weight ranges from 0.023 kg (mouse) to 9,400 kg (triceratops) 
			and has an extremely skew distribution, the diagram plots log brain weight 
			against log body weight.</p>

		<p>There is quite a strong relationship between the variables &mdash; heavier animals 
			tend to have larger brains. However verify the following by clicking on 
			the crosses</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The triceratops is an outlier &mdash; it lies below the upward-sloping cluster 
				of crosses. Its brain weight is not extreme and its body weight is not 
				extreme enough to be considered an outlier in its own right. However <strong>it 
				is much heavier than other animals with similar brain weights</strong>. 
				(This dinosaur does not follow the pattern shown by the mammals.)</li>
			<li>Although the mouse has lowest body and brain weight, neither measurement 
				is extreme enough for it to be called an outlier. And it follows the same 
				relationship between body and brain weight as the other mammals.</li>
			<li>The four primates in the data set lie slightly above the main cluster 
				of crosses &mdash; they are not unusual enough to be called outliers, but their 
				brain weights are fairly large in relation to their body weights.</li>
		</ul>

  <p class=heading>Importance of outliers</p>

  <p>Outliers are features of a data set that <strong>must</strong> be carefully 
		checked. An outlier is often caused by a recording or transcription error, 
		so...</p>
		
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
		<tr>
		  <td align="center"><strong>First check that the values of the variables 
				are correctly recorded.</strong></td>
	</tr>
</table>

  <p>Sometimes an outlier arises because an individual is fundamentally different 
    from the others. This may be important information and may point to a new 
    plant species, an employee who is performing poorly, a single mature student 
    in a class of teenagers, ...</p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
		<tr>
		  <td align="center"><strong>The individuals should be further examined (perhaps 
				collecting further information from them) to try to assess whether the 
				outlier individual has distinct characteristics.</strong></td>
	</tr>
</table>

  
	<p>An outlier that is either extreme or that has other distinctive characteristics 
		would often be deleted from the data set, but should be mentioned in a report 
		about the data. </p>

		<p>One house had an extremely high floor area &mdash; it stands out as an outlier 
      in the marginal distribution of floor area. From the relationship between 
      floor area and price of the other houses, we would <strong>also</strong> 
      have expected this house's sale price to have been higher, so it is an outlier 
      because the house does not follow the pattern that is evident in the rest 
      of the data.</p>
		<p>Ideally, we would try to find out what was special about the house. Was 
			it mis-classified as a house when it was really a commercial property or 
			block of apartments?</p>
		<p>However since no further information is available about this outlier, we 
			could omit it from further analysis. However in any reports we should state 
			that our conclusions are only valid for houses below 400 square metres.</p>
