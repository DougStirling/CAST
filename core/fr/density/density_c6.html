<p class=heading>Superimposing histograms</p>
	<p>To compare the distributions in two groups of values (e.g. measurements for males and females), histograms for the two groups can be superimposed on the same axes.</p>
	<p>Colour or shading should be used to help distinguish 
	  the two histograms &mdash; in ordinary black-and-white histograms it can 
	  be difficult to tell which lines belong to which histograms.</p>
	<p class=heading>Relative frequencies to compare two groups</p>
	<p>If the number of values in the two groups differ, when two standard histograms are drawn against a common frequency axis, one histogram can be much smaller than the other. This makes the two distributions much harder to compare.</p>
	<p>The solution is to 
	  make each rectangle height equal to the <strong>proportion</strong> in that 
	  class instead of the class frequency. These proportions are also called the <strong>relative frequencies</strong> in the classes.</p>
	<div class="boxed">
    <p>Use relative frequency histograms to compare groups.</p>
  </div>
	<p>An individual relative frequency histogram has the same shape as the corresponding frequency 
	  histogram &mdash; each bar height is simply divided by the total number of observations 
	  which rescales the histogram height. However using relative frequencies allows 
	  us to make more meaningful comparisons between the distributions of different 
	  groups.</p>

	  <p class=heading>Retail store buyers</p>

		<p>Merchandise buyers are critically important to the success or failure of 
			retail ventures, both through negotiations over pricing and decisions about 
			the types of product that will be stocked. Because of high turnover of staff 
			in this area (estimated to be over 25 percent per year), research was carried 
			out to determine the factors related to turnover. The researchers contacted 
			merchandise buyers in several stores and asked them to complete a questionnaire. 
			After 9 months, the researchers determined whether the buyers were in the 
			same job &mdash; a classification into 'leavers' and 'stayers'.</p>
		<p>The two histograms below describe the job satisfaction ratings of the two 
			groups at the time of the questionnaire, on a scale of 0 (worst) to 30 (best).</p>

</div>

		<p>The area of the histogram for the stayers is nearly five times that of 
			the movers (since there were nearly five the number of stayers as movers) 
			and this makes comparisons a little harder.</p>
		<p>Select <strong>Relative frequency</strong> from the pop-up menu to scale 
      both histograms to have the same area.</p>
		<p>It is easier to compare the relative frequency histograms. For example, 
			we can now determine visually that the distribution of job satisfaction 
			is higher for stayers than for leavers, even though the two distributions 
			overlap considerably.</p>

	<p class=heading>Population pyramids</p>
	<p>When two groups are to be compared, an alternative to superimposition is 
		to draw their two histograms back-to-back (in a similar way to back-to-back 
		stem and leaf plots). </p>
	<p>When used to compare age distributions of males and females in a population, 
		these back-to-back histograms are called <strong>population pyramids</strong> 
		-- a common tool in demography. </p>
	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p>The population pyramids below show the age distributions of New Zealanders 
			of European and Maori descent in 1989.</p>
		<div class="centred"><object data="images/popnPyramids.svg" width="673" height="330"></object></div>
		<p>Since the two ethnic groups are of different sizes, relative frequency 
			(in the form of a percentage) is used rather than frequency, permitting 
			easier comparison of the groups. Note that...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Maori population pyramid has a wider base than that of the Europeans, 
        indicating high birth rates and a relatively youthful population.</li>
      <li>In the population pyramid for those of European descent, a bigger proportion of females than males is older than 65.</li>
    </ul>
