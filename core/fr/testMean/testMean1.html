<p class="heading">Tests about numerical populations</p>

<p>The most important characteristic of a numerical population is usually its 
mean, µ. 
Hypothesis tests therefore usually question the value of this parameter.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Blood pressure of executives</p>

<p>The medical director of a large company looks at the medical records of 72 
male executives aged between 35 and 44 and observes that their mean systolic blood pressure 
is <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;=&nbsp;126.07. 
We model their 72 blood pressures as a random sample from an underlying population 
with mean µ 
(systolic blood pressures of similar executives) .</p>
<p>Published national health statistics report that in the general population
 for males aged 35-44, systolic blood pressures have mean 128 and standard deviation 15.
 Do the executives conform to this population? Focusing on the <strong>mean</strong> 
of the blood pressure distribution, this can be expressed as the hypotheses,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 128</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 128</strong></span></p>

<p class="heading">Active ingredient in medicine</p>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies routinely test their products to ensure that the amount 
of active ingredient is within tight limits. However the chemical analysis is 
not precise and repeated measurements of this same specimen differ slightly. One 
type of analysis has errors that are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard 
deviation 0.0068 grams per litre.</p>
<p>A product is tested three times with the following concentrations of the active 
ingredient:</p>
<p class=eqn>0.8403, 0.8363 and 0.8447 grams per litre</p>
<p>Are the data consistent with the target concentration of 0.86 grams per litre? 
This can be expressed as a hypothesis test comparing...</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.86</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 0.86</strong></span></p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Null and alternative hypotheses</p>
<p>Both of the above examples involve tests of hypotheses</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span></p>
<p>where µ<sub>0</sub> is the constant that we think may be the true mean. These are called <strong>two-tailed</strong> 
tests. In other situations, the alternative hypothesis may involve only high (or 
low) values of µ 
(<strong>one-tailed </strong>tests), such as</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span></p>
