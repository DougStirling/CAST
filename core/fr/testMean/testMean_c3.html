<p class=heading>Model and hypotheses</p>
<p>In both examples in the first page of this section, there was knowledge of the population 
standard deviation σ
(at least when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> was true). This greatly 
simplifies the problem of finding a p-value for the test.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<dl>
<dt>Blood pressure of executives</dt>
<dd>From published information, the national distribution of blood pressure in 
males aged 35-44 is known to have a standard deviation σ 
= 15.</dd>
<dt>Filling milk containers</dt>
<dd>The variataion caused by the filling machinery is well understood and the 
standard deviation of the volume of milk is known to be σ 
= 0.005 litres.</dd>
</dl>

</div>

<p>In both examples, the hypotheses were of the form,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span></p>

<p class=heading>Summary Statistic</p>

<p>The first step in finding a p-value for the test is to identify a summary statistic 
that throws light on whether <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> or <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> is true. 
When testing the population mean, µ, 
the obvious summary statistic is the sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, 
and the hypothesis tests that will be described here are based on this.</p>
<p>We saw earlier that sample mean has a distribution with mean and standard deviation</p>
<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:6px"><img src="../../images/symbol.muXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=&nbsp; &mu;</span> 
</p>
<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position:relative; top:12px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline"></span> 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('randomMean5')">Central 
Limit Theorem</a> states that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately 
normal, provided the sample size is not small. (The result holds even for small 
samples if the population distribution is also normal.)</p>
<p class=heading>P-value</p>

<p>The p-value for the test is the probability of getting a sample mean as 'extreme' 
as the one that was recorded when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> is true.</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Note that we can assume knowledge of both µ 
and σ 
in this calculation &mdash; the values of both are fixed by <b>H<sub>0</sub></b></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Since we know the distribution of the sample mean (when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> 
is true), the p-value can be evaluated as the tail area of this distribution.</p>

<dl>
<dt>One-tailed test</dt>
<dd>If the alternative hypothesis <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> specifies <strong>large</strong> 
values of µ, 
the p-value is the upper tail area (shown in green below). If <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> 
is for <strong>small</strong> values of µ, 
the opposite tail of the distribution is used.</dd>

	</object>
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Two-tailed test</dt>
	<dd>If the alternative hypothesis <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> allows for <strong>large 
		or small</strong> values of µ, 
		the p-value is the sum of the two tail areas below.</dd>

<p class=heading>Weights of courier packages</p>
	
<p>A courier company suspected that the weight of recently shipped packages had 
dropped. From past records, the mean weight of packages was 18.3 kg and their 
standard deviation was 7.1 kg. These figures were based on a very large number 
of packages and can be considered as accurate.</p>
<p>Thirty packages were sampled from the previous week and their mean weight was 
found to be 16.8 kg. The data are displayed in the jittered dot plot below.</p>

<p>If the null hypothesis was true, the sample mean would have the normal distribution 
shown in pale blue. Although the sample mean weight is lower than 18.3 kg, it 
is not particularly unusual for this distribution, so we conclude that there is 
no evidence that the mean weight has reduced.</p>
<p>The right of the diagram shows how the p-value is calculated. A z-score is 
obtained by standardising the sample mean, then this is used to find the probability 
from a standard normal distribution.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>Choose <strong>Modified Data</strong> from the pop-up menu. The slider allows 
you to investigate how low the sample mean must become in order to give strong 
evidence that µ 
is less than 18.3.</p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Test Statistic</p>

<p>In the example above, we found the p-value by standardising <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">. 
The intermediate z-value is called a <strong>test statistic</strong> and has a 
'standard' distribution from which the p-value can be found.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the stages in obtaining the p-value for a two-tailed 
test. </p>
