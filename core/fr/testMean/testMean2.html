<p class=heading>Model and hypotheses</p>
<p>In both examples in the first page of this section, there was knowledge of the population 
standard deviation σ
(at least when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> was true). This greatly 
simplifies the problem of finding a p-value for the test.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<dl>
<dt>Blood pressure of executives</dt>
<dd>From published information, the national distribution of blood pressure in 
males aged 35-44 is known to have a standard deviation σ 
= 15.</dd>
<dt>Active ingredient in medicine</dt>
<dd>The testing procedure is widely used and the errors are known to have a distribution 
with σ 
= 0.0068 grams per litre.</dd>
</dl>

</div>

<p>In both examples, the hypotheses were of the form,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span></p>

<p class=heading>Summary Statistic</p>

<p>The first step in finding a p-value for the test is to identify a summary statistic 
that throws light on whether <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> or <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> is true. 
When testing the population mean, µ, 
the obvious summary statistic is the sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, 
and the hypothesis tests that will be described here are based on this.</p>
<p>We saw earlier that sample mean has a distribution with mean and standard deviation</p>
<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:6px"><img src="../../images/symbol.muXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=&nbsp; &mu;</span> 
</p>
<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position:relative; top:12px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline"></span> 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('randomMean5')">Central 
Limit Theorem</a> states that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately 
normal, provided the sample size is not small. (The result holds even for small 
samples if the population distribution is also normal.)</p>
<p class=heading>P-value</p>

<p>The p-value for the test is the probability of getting a sample mean as 'extreme'
 as the one that was recorded when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> is true. It can be found
directly from the distribution of the sample mean.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Note that we can assume knowledge of both µ 
and σ 
in this calculation &mdash; the values of both are fixed by <b>H<sub>0</sub></b></p>
</div></div>

<p>Since we know the distribution of the sample mean (when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> 
is true), the p-value can be evaluated as the tail area of this distribution.</p>

<dl>
<dt>One-tailed test</dt>
<dd>If the alternative hypothesis <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> specifies <strong>large</strong> 
values of µ, 
the p-value is the upper tail area (shown in green below). If <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> 
is for <strong>small</strong> values of µ, 
the opposite tail of the distribution is used.</dd>
</dl>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" width="267" height="155"> 
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Two-tailed test</dt>
<dd>If the alternative hypothesis <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> allows for <strong>large
 or small</strong> values of µ, 
the p-value is the sum of the two tail areas below &mdash; <strong>twice</strong> the
smaller tail area.</dd>
</dl>
