<p class="heading">Interval estimates</p>
<p>In the previous page, we showed that the same value,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><span style="position:relative; top:4px"><img src="../../images/symbol.yHat.png" width="10" height="17" align="baseline"></span>&nbsp; =&nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>b</em><sub>1 </sub><em>x</em></span> 
</p>
<p>is used both to estimate the mean response at <em>x</em> and to predict a new 
individual's response at <em>x</em>. However the errors are different in the two 
situations &mdash; the errors tend to be larger for predicting a new value.</p>
<p>In both situations, it is more informative to give an interval of 'likely' 
values rather than a single value.</p>
  
<p class="heading">Estimating mean response </p>
  
<p>A 95% confidence interval for the mean response takes the form</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" width="224" height="26">
</p>

<p>We do not provide a formula for the standard error on the right of this formula 
-- the details are not important and statistical software will tell you the value.</p>
<p class=heading>Predicting a new individual's response</p>

<p>For prediction, a similar interval can be found</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/regnPred/images/predInterval.gif" width="169" height="21"> 
</p>
<p>where the constant <em>k</em> is greater than the corresponding standard error 
for the confidence interval. <font color="#666666">(Again we do not provide a 
full formula. Statistical computer software will perform the calculations for 
you.)</font> </p>
<p>A <strong>95% prediction interval</strong> is wider than a 95% confidence interval 
for the distribution's mean. </p>

<p class=heading>Extrapolation</p>
<p>These 95% confidence intervals and 95% prediction intervals are valid within 
the range of x-values about which we have collected data, but <strong>they should 
not be relied on for <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('curvature4')">extrapolation</a></strong>. 
Both intervals assume that the normal linear model describes the process, but 
we have no information about linearity beyond the x-values that have been collected. 
</p>

<p>From a scatterplot, we can check that there is approximate linearity within 
the observed range of x-values but there is no way to check linearity beyond the 
observed data.</p>

<p class="heading">Grass intake of dairy cows</p>

<p>An experiment was conducted to investigate the grazing behaviour of dairy cows. 
Four cows were studied while they grazed on 48 different plots of grass, each 
of which had different sward height. In each plot, the total grazing time was 
recorded and the grass intake rate (in grams dry matter per minute) was estimated 
by sampling from the plot before and after the experiment. The diagram below shows 
the relationship between grass intake rate and sward height.</p>

<ul>
<li>the 95% confidence interval for the mean grass intake for any sward height, 
and</li>
<li>the 95% prediction interval for the recorded grass intake for a <strong>single</strong> 
dairy cow on a plot of that sward height.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of uncertainty about linearity of the relationship, the confidence 
intervals and prediction intervals are unreliable if <i>X</i> is greater than 
12 or less than&nbsp;35. </p>
