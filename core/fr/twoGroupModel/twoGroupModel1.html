<p class="heading">Interest in comparing two groups</p>

<p>We often want to compare individuals (or other units) from two groups. If a numerical
value is recorded from each individual, the resulting data consist of two batches of
numbers &mdash; one from each group.
Differences between the distributions of values in the two groups are often of interest.
</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="white">
      <tr>
<th align="CENTER" width="22%"><font color="blue">'Individuals'</font></th>
<th align="CENTER" width="22%"><font color="blue">Measurement</font></th>
<th align="CENTER" width="22%"><font color="blue">Groups</font></th>
<th align="CENTER" width="34%"><font color="blue">Question</font></th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Children aged 10</td>
<td>Mark in a Maths test</td>
<td>Boys and girls</td>
<td>Are male marks higher on average than female marks?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Plots in a field</td>
<td>Yield of wheat per sqr metre</td>
<td>Varieties A and B</td>
<td>Does either variety of wheat give higher yields? By how much?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Cars leaving production line</td>
<td>CO emissions from exhaust</td>
<td>Production lines 1 and 2</td>
<td>Are emissions the same in cars from both production lines?</td></tr>

  <p class="heading">Questions are often about underlying populations</p>
  <p>The questions in the above scenarios are not about the <strong>specific</strong> 
	children who took the Maths test, the <strong>specific</strong> plots in the 
	field, etc. They ask about the differences between 10-year-old boys and girls 
	<strong>in general</strong>, the differences between the two wheat varieties 
	<strong>in general</strong>, etc. </p>

<p>We are therefore usually interested in the characteristics of a population 
or process that we assume <strong>underlies</strong> the data that are collected. 
The data provide information about the likely characteristics of the population.

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Examples</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a few data sets in which values are in two groups.</p>

<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeSvgImage(this)">
<option value="0" selected>Anticipation of hypnosis and ventilation</option>
<option value="1">Effect of vitamin D on egg shell density</option>
<option value="2">Birth weights in summer and winter</option>
<option value="3">Teeth and gender</option>
</select>
</form>

<p align="center"><iframe src="images/hypnosis.svg" id="dataImage" width="523" height="299" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Note that the red questions do not refer to the specific individuals in the 
study, but ask about differences between the groups 'in general' &mdash; we would like 
to use the answers to predict what will happen to other individuals. </p>
