<p class="heading">Estimating other parameters of a normal population</p>

  <p>In normal populations, the mean, µ, 
		is the parameter that is most often estimated. However numerical distributions 
		have other parameters that may be of interest. For example,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>standard deviation</li>
		<li>interquartile range (upper quartile - lower quartile)</li>
		<li>median</li>
		<li>other percentiles (e.g. the upper quartile)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These parameters can be estimated using the corresponding summary statistic 
		from a random sample, but the error distribution may be difficult to obtain 
		theoretically.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simulation</p>
	<p>Since the parameters µ 
		and σ 
		are unknown, we cannot perform a simulation with repeated samples from the 
		actual population. However we can conduct a simulation from our best estimate 
		of the population distribution &mdash; i.e. replacing µ 
		and σ 
		with the sample mean and standard deviation.</p>
	<p>We repeatedly take samples of size <em>n</em> from this approximate population 
		and evaluate the estimation error from using each sample. (Since we know the 
		population from which we are sampling, we know the population parameter and 
		can find the estimation error.)</p>
	<p>The standard deviation of these errors is the approximate standard error 
		of the estimator.</p>

    <p class=heading>Annual rainfall in Samaru, Nigeria</p>

	  
    <p>In most of Africa, the most important climatic variable is rainfall. Rainfall 
      is usually highly seasonal and failure of crops is normally associated with 
      late arrival of rain or low rainfall. A better understanding of the distribution 
      of rainfall can affect the crops that are grown and when they are planted.</p>

        <tr>

						that is not reached in 1 year out of 4?<strong> </strong></strong></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>
    <p>In other words, we want to estimate the <strong>lower quartile</strong> 
      of the annual rainfall.</p>
		
    <p class=eqn><object data="images/samaruLQ.svg" width="398" height="127"></object></p>
		
    <p>The above dot plot shows the annual rainfall in Samaru, Northern Nigeria 
      between 1928 and 1983 and their upper quartile. Assuming that there is no 
      climate change (or that climate change is negligible compared to the year-to-year 
      variation in rainfall),&nbsp;...</p>

    <p>The Samaru rainfalls have a fairly symmetric distribution so it is reasonable 
      to try simulating random samples from a normal population. The diagram below 
      shows a normal distribution whose mean and standard deviation equal those 
      of our actual data.</p>
			
    <p class=eqn><object data="images/samaruModel.svg" width="399" height="141"></object></p>
		
    <p>We will use this normal distribution as a population from which to sample 
      56 values &mdash; simulated rainfalls from 56 years. For the normal&nbsp;(1068.1,&nbsp;178.5) 
      distribution, the lower quartile is 947.8 mm, so this is the 'target' parameter 
      that is estimated by our simulated samples.</p>

    <p>The diagram initially shows a sample of 56 rainfalls. The error is the 
      difference between the sample lower quartile and the underlying population 
      parameter, 947.8 mm.</p>
    <p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times and observe that the error 
      varies from sample to sample.</p>
    <p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then take several samples (of 56 annual 
      rainfalls). The error distribution is built up as a stacked dot plot at 
      the bottom of the diagram.</p>

	  <p>In the simulation, you should have observed that the bias of the estimator 
			is small, so we will treat it as zero.</p>
		<p>The estimated standard error in your simulation was probably just over 
			4&nbsp;sec. We can use the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb to help interpret its
