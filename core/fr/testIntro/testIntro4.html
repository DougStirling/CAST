<p class=heading>Assessing a claim about a mean</p>
<p>In this example, we ask whether a sample mean is consistent with the underlying population mean having a target value.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>Quality control for cornflake packets</p>

<p>In a factory producing packets of cornflakes, the weight of cornflakes that a filling machine places in each packet varies from packet to packet. From extensive previous monitoring of the operation of the machine, it is known that the net weight of '500&nbsp;gm' packets is approximately normal with standard deviation σ = 10&nbsp;gm.</p>
<p>The mean net weight of cornflakes in the packets is controlled by a single knob. The target is for a mean  of µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520&nbsp;gm to ensure that few packets will contain less than 500&nbsp;gm. Samples are  regularly taken to assess whether the machine needs to be adjusted. A sample of 10 packets was weighed and contained an average of 529&nbsp;gm. Does this indicate that the underlying mean has drifted from µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520 and that the machine needs to be adjusted?</p>
<p class=heading>A simulation</p>
<p>If the filling machine is working to specifications, each packet would contain a  weight that is sampled from a normal distribution with µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520 and σ = 10.</p>
<table cellpadding="10" class="centred" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="75%" border="1">
	<tr>
		<td><strong>How unlikely is it to get the mean of a sample of size 10 that is as far from 520 as 529 if the machine is working correctly?</strong></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>A simulation helps to answer this question.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Simulate</strong> to randomly generate the weights of 10 packets from a normal&nbsp;(µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520,&nbsp;σ = 10) distribution. Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> 
then run the simulation between 100 and 200 times. <font color="#666666">(Hold 
down the <strong>Simulate</strong> button to speed up the process.)</font></p>
<p>Observe that although many of the individual cornflake packets weigh more than 529&nbsp;gm, it is rare for the <strong>mean</strong> weight to be as far from the target as 529&nbsp;gm (i.e. either ≥529&nbsp;gm or ≤511&nbsp;gm).</p>

<td><strong>There is therefore strong evidence that the machine is no longer filling packets with a mean weight of 520&nbsp;gm and needs adjusting &mdash; a sample mean of 529&nbsp;gm would be unlikely
