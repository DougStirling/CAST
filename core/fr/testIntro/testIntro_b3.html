<p class=heading>Other uses of simulation</p>
<p>Simulations can help us to answer questions about a variety of other models 
(or populations). The following example shows another simple simulation.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Scaring whales from fishing boats</p>

<p>Commercial fishermen in some parts of the Atlantic Ocean occasionally have 
problems with whales scaring away fish. The whales often do not stay long, perhaps 
leaving to avoid the noise made by the boats. Sonar operators have found that 
40% of all whales leave soon after the boat arrives.</p>
<p>In an attempt to get the whales to leave, an experiment was conducted in which 
a boat transmitted underwater the sounds of a killer whale. Of 30 whales, half 
were scared away immediately by this device. Since a higher proportion than 40% 
were scared away, can we conclude that the device is effective?</p>
	
<p class=heading>A simulation</p>
<p>If the device was ineffective, and every whale independently had probability 
0.4 of leaving immediately, we know that the number scared away out of 30 whales 
will be a random quantity.</p>
<table cellpadding="10" class="centred" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="75%" border="1">
<tr>
<td><strong>How unlikely is it to get as few as 15 out of 30 staying if the device 
is ineffective (and the probability of leaving is 0.4 is correct)?</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>A simulation helps to answer this question.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Simulate</strong> to randomly 'try the device on 30 whales', 
with each independently having probability 0.4 of leaving and 0.6 of staying &mdash; 
i.e. with the device having no effect. Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then 
run the simulation between 100 and 200 times. <font color="#666666">(Hold down 
the <strong>Simulate</strong> button to speed up the process.)</font></p>
<p>Observe the distribution of the number of whales leaving. The proportion of 
simulations with 15 or whales leaving is shown to the right of the dot plot. Observe 
that this happens around 15% of the time.</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<td><strong>We therefore cannot conclude that the device is effective &mdash; getting 
15 whales leaving out of 30 is not unusual even if the device has no effect.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
