<p class=heading>Randomness in sports results</p>

<p>Although we like to think that the 'best' team wins in sports competitions, 
there is actually considerable variability in the results. Much of this variability 
can be considered to be random &mdash; if the same teams play again, the results are 
often different. The most obvious examples of this randomness occur when a series 
of matches is played between the same two teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Finals Series for the National Basketball League in the USA, the two 
finalists play a series of 7 matches. The eventual winner usually loses at least 
one match during the series.</li>
<li>In cricket, there is often a series of one-day internationals between a touring 
team and the home team. Again, all games are rarely won by the same team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the teams are virtually unchanged in any series, the variability in results 
can only be explained through randomness.</p>
<p class=heading>Randomness or skill?</p>
<p>When we look at sports results, can we tell whether all teams are equally matched 
with the same probability of winning? Or do some teams have a higher probability 
of winning than others?</p>
<p>There are different ways to examine this question, depending on the type of 
data that is available. The following example assesses an end-of-year league table.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>English Premier Soccer League, 2008/09</p>

<p>In the English Premier Soccer league, each of the 20 teams plays every other 
team twice (home and away) during the season. Three points are awarded for a win 
and one point for a draw. The table below shows the wins, draws, losses and total 
points for all teams at the end of the 2008/09 season.</p>

<p class=heading>A simulation</p>
<p>To assess whether there is any difference in skill levels, we can therefore 
run a simulation of the league, assuming evenly matched teams and generating random 
results with probabilities 0.372, 0.372 and 0.255 for wins, losses and draws. 
(A proportion 0.255 of games in the actual league resulted in draws.)</p>

<p>Click <strong>Simulate</strong> to simulate the 380 games in a season. The 
standard deviation of the final points is shown below the table. Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> 
then run the simulation about 100 times. <font color="#666666">(Hold down the 
<strong>Simulate</strong> button to speed up the process.)</font></p>
<p>The standard deviation of the points in the actual league table was 18.2. Since 
most simulated standard deviations are between 5 and 12, we conclude that such 
a high spread would be extremely unlikely if the teams were evenly matched.</p>
