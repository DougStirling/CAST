<p class="heading">A general framework</p>
<p>The examples in earlier pages of this section involved different types of data 
and different analyses. Indeed, you may find it difficult to spot their common 
theme!</p>
<p>All analyses were examples of <strong>hypothesis testing</strong>. We now describe 
the general framework of hypothesis testing within which all of these examples 
fit. This general framework is the basis for important applications in later sections 
of CAST.</p>

<p class="heading">The model and data</p>

<p>Each example involved a model, some of whose characteristics were unknown. 
A set of data from the model is available and we hope to use it to answer questions 
about the model.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Soccer league in one season</dt>
<dd>Some random mechanism underlies the actual results in the matches during a 
season. The probabilities of winning may vary from team to team and there may 
be a home-team advantage, so there are a lot of unknowns about this model! Our 
data are a single set of results &mdash; the league table at the end of the season.</dd>
<dt>Weapon detection at LAX</dt>
<dd>Each weapon has some probability of being detected &mdash; our model. We also assume 
that detection of different weapons is independent, a reasonable assumption if 
different FAA agents are used over a reasonable period of time, but not if the 
same agent repeatedly tries to carry a weapon on board. A sample of 100 weapons 
was used and our data is the number that were detected.</dd>
<dt>Net weight of corn flake packets</dt>
<dd>We are told that the net weight of corn flake packets is normally distributed with a standard deviation of σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;gm and unknown mean, µ. The data are a random sample from this distribution.</dd>
<dt>Characteristics of failed companies</dt>
<dd>We assume that our data (asset-to-liability ratios from companies) are random 
samples of 68 and 33 from underlying populations of healthy and failed companies 
(respectively) in Greece. Random sampling from these unknown populations is our 
model.</dd>
<dt>Soccer leagues in two seasons</dt>
<dd>Some random mechanism again generates results during each season &mdash; our model. 
In this case, we have recorded the number of points for each team at the end of 
two successive seasons &mdash; our data.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="heading">Asking a question &mdash; the null hypothesis</p>
<p>All models had unknown characteristics, and we want to know whether the model 
has particular properties &mdash; the <strong>null hypothesis</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Soccer league in one season</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that all teams are equally matched &mdash; i.e. that they 
all have the same probability of winning each match.</dd>
<dt>Weapon detection at LAX</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that each weapon has probability 0.80 of being detected 
-- the national rate.</dd>
<dt>Net weight of corn flake packets</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that the weights of packets have a distribution with mean µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520&nbsp;gm.</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt>Characteristics of failed companies</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that the population distribution of asset-to-liabilities 
ratio is the same for healthy and failed companies.</dd>
<dt>Soccer leagues in two seasons</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that all teams (other than Manchester United, Arsenal, 
Liverpool and Leeds) have the same probabilities of winning against the same opposition 
in both seasons.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The focus of our hypothesis test is whether or not the null hypothesis holds.</p>
<p class="heading">The alternative hypothesis</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis is not true, we say that the <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> 
holds. (You can understand most of hypothesis testing without paying much attention 
to the alternative hypothesis however!)</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Either the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis must be true.</strong></td>
</tr>

<p class="heading">Using the data</p>
<p>We assess the null hypothesis by asking&nbsp;...</p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#990000" bgcolor="#FFFF33">
<tr>

</center>
<p>It is <strong>extremely</strong> important that you understand that hypothesis 
testing addresses this question &mdash; make sure that you remember it well!!</p>
<p class="heading">Test statistic</p>
<p>Some function of the data is picked that throws light on whether the null or 
alternative hypothesis holds.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Soccer league in one season</dt>
<dd>The standard deviation of final points was used. It will be higher if the 
teams have different abilities (the alternative hypothesis).</dd>
<dt>Weapon detection at LAX</dt>
<dd>The proportion of weapons detected is the test statistic. It will be far from 
0.80 if LAX is different from other airports (the alternative hypothesis).</dd>
<dt>Weights of cornflake packets</dt>
<dd>The mean weight of our sample of 10 packets 
	is the test statistic. It will be close to 520&nbsp;gm if the filling machine is working correctly (the null hypothesis) and will be far from this if the mean filling weight has drifted from 520&nbsp;gm (the alternative hypothesis).</dd>
<dt>Characteristics of failed companies</dt>
<dd>The difference between the mean asset-to-liabilities ratios of the healthy 
and failed companies was the test statistic. It should be close to zero if the 
null hypothesis holds, and far from zero if the alternative hypothesis holds.</dd>
<dt>Soccer leagues in two seasons</dt>
<dd>The correlation coefficient between the final points of teams in the two seasons 
is the test statistic. It will be close to zero if the teams have the same chances 
of winning (the null hypothesis) and will be positive if some teams have higher 
chances of winning than others (the alternative hypothesis).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">P-value</p>
<p>The question</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">

</center>
<p>is rephrased as...</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<td><strong>What is the probability of obtaining such an 'extreme' value of the 
test statistic if the null hypothesis holds?</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>This probability is called the <strong>p-value</strong> for the hypothesis 
test. There are various ways to find the p-value. Note that all of them <strong>assume 
that the null hypothesis is true</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Soccer league in one season</dt>
<dd>We simulated the soccer league, assuming that all teams had the same probability 
of winning. The p-value was the probability of getting a standard deviation of 
final points as high as 16.7 (the actual data).</dd>
<dt>Weapon detection at LAX</dt>
<dd>We simulated carrying 100 weapons onto planes, assuming that each had probability 
0.80 of being detected. The p-value was the probability of <sup>72</sup>/<sub>100</sub> 
or fewer being detected (the actual data).</dd>
<dt>Characteristics of failed companies</dt>
<dd>We randomised the 101 asset-to-liabilities ratios between the two groups of 
companies &mdash; each is equally likely if the populations are the same. The p-value 
was the probability that the difference in means is further from zero than 0.902 
(the actual data).</dd>
<dt>Soccer leagues in two seasons</dt>
<dd>We randomised the points in the second season &mdash; each is equally likely if 
the teams have the same probability of winning. The p-value was the probability 
that the correlation coefficient is further from zero than 0.149 (the actual data).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">Interpreting the p-value</p>
<p>Although it may be regarded as an over-simplification, the table below can 
be used as a guide to interpreting p-values. </p>
