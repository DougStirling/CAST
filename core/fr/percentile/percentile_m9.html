<p class=heading>Rate per <em>n</em> values</p>
	<p>Consider an event such as annual rainfall below 900 mm that has occurred 
		in 20 out of the last 100 years in some village. The proportion, <sup>20</sup>/<sub>100</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.2, 
		can be expressed in a few equivalent ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a rate of 20 per 100 years</li>
		<li>a rate of 2 per 10 years</li>
		<li>a rate of 1 per 5 years</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This can be generalised to give a rate per <em>n</em> years, where <em>n</em> 
		is usually some small value.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The rate per <em>n</em> 
				years was <strong><em>n</em> &nbsp;&times;&nbsp;proportion</strong></p>
</div></div>

	<p>Note that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the rate was 1 per 5 years, this does not mean that it occurred exactly 
			once in <strong>every</strong> 5 years &mdash; it occurred once <strong>on average</strong> 
			in 5 years.</li>
		<li>The rate is not necessarily a whole number. For example, the above rate 
			could be expressed as 1.6 times per 8 years.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Percentages</p>
	<p>A percentage is simply the rate of occurrences per 100 values &mdash; i.e. the 
		proportions times 100.</p>

		<p>Initially the diagram shows the rate of years with rainfall 900&nbsp;mm 
			or less per 56 years. This is simply the number of years with that rainfall 
			in the 56 years between 1928 and 1983.</p>
		<p>Use the slider to increase <em>n</em> to 100 years. The calculations show 
			the rate of years with rainfall 900&nbsp;mm or less per 100 years &mdash; the 
			percentage of years with rainfall below 900&nbsp;mm in the data.</p>
		<p>The numbers can be easier to interpret if they are expressed as the rate 
			of years with rainfall 900&nbsp;mm or less in <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, 
			or 20 or 25 years. Use the slider to try these values.</p>
		<hr width="75%">
		<p>Finally select <strong>larger values</strong> from the pop-up menu and 
			observe that</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pr(rainfall &gt; 900) &nbsp; = &nbsp; 1 - Pr(rainfall &lt;= 900)</li>
			<li>Percentage(rainfall &gt; 900) &nbsp; = &nbsp; 100 - Percentage(rainfall 
				&lt;= 900)</li>
			<li>Rate of years out of <em>n</em> with rainfall &gt; 900<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp; <em>n</em> - (rate of years 
				out of <em>n</em> with rainfall &lt;= 900)</li>

	<p class=heading>Expected occurrences in <em>n</em> <span class="darkred">new</span> 
		values</p>
	<p>The cumulative proportions and rates that we discussed earlier have all described 
		aspects of the existing data. In the rainfall data from Samaru, they describe 
		what happened in the years between 1928 and 1983.</p>
	<p>If we can assume that rainfall <strong>in the future</strong> will have the 
		same distribution (no climate change), a rate per <em>n</em> years can also 
		be interpreted as the expected number of occurrences in <em>n</em> <strong>future</strong> 
		years. </p>
	<p class=heading>Average time with one occurrence (return period)</p>
	<p>A third way to express proportions is the number of values in which there 
		is an average of <strong>exactly one</strong> occurrence of the event of interest. 
		This is the inverse of its probability. In many application areas of statistics, 
		this is called the <strong>return period</strong> of the event.</p>

	<p class=heading>Why so many different ways to express a proportion?</p>
	<p>When explaining the results of an analysis to others, it often helps to repeat 
		the same information in different words. Many people find it difficult to 
		understand what a proportion tells them about the data, and expressing the 
		proportion in a few different ways can help.</p>
	<div class="diagram">

		<p class=heading>Rainfall below 800 mm in Samaru</p>

		<p>In the 56 years of rainfall data that were recorded in Samaru, the proportion 
			of years with rainfall below 800mm was 0.054. The following are equivalent 
			ways to explain this proportion to others.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Rainfall was below 800 mm on 5.4% of the years.</li>
			<li>The rate of years with rainfall below 800 mm was 0.054&nbsp;*&nbsp;20 
				= 1.1 years per 20 years.</li>
			<li>Rainfall was below 800 mm once per 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;0.054 = 18.5 years. 
				(The return period for rainfall below 800 mm was 18.5 years.)</li>
			<li>Rainfall was above 800 mm once per 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;0.946 = 1.06 years. 
				(The return period for rainfall above 800 mm was 1.06 years.) </li>
		</ul>

		<p> Note that return periods are easier to interpret, when the period is long, 
			so we would not usually use return periods to describe proportions less 
			than 0.5. </p>
		<p>These descriptions are factual summaries of what happened between 1928 
			and 1983. Assuming that there is no climate change and that future weather 
			patterns and distributions will be as in the past, we could also state that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We expect rainfall below 800 mm on 5.4 out of the next 100 years.</li>
			<li>We expect rainfall above 800 mm on (100&nbsp;-&nbsp;5.4) = 94.6 out 
				of the next 100 years.</li>
		</ul>
