<p class="heading">Confounding</p>
  <p>In a badly designed experiment, the characteristics of the experimental units can distort the apparent relationship between the controlled variable and response.</p>
  <p>In the most extreme case, the design makes it <strong>impossible</strong> to 
		disentangle the effects of the treatment and other characteristics of the experimental uits. If the treatment is perfectly correlated with another 
		variable, the effects of the two variables <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished. 
  The treatment and variable are then said to be <strong>confounded</strong>.</p>
  <p>It is particularly important that confounding is avoided when data are collected.</p>

		<p class="heading">Experiment with a new cafe layout</p>
		<p>A chain of cafes has decided to update its image with different advertising 
			and a new layout for its outlets. The diagram below shows sales from a random 
			sample of 10 cafes before the change (2003), and sales from another sample 
			of 10 cafes after the change (2004).</p>

<p class="eqn"><object data="images/confounded_c3.svg" width="351" height="126"></object></p>

		<p>Although the mean sales are higher, it should <strong>not</strong> be concluded 
			that the new layout has improved sales. The two layouts were tried in different 
			years, and there may have been an unrelated changes in the 'cafe culture' 
			between 2003 and 2004 &mdash; the layout is confounded with other changes over 
			time.</p>

<p class="eqn"><object data="images/confounded_c4.svg" width="351" height="126"></object></p>

		<p>Perhaps sales are higher because people had more disposable income in 2004.</p>

		<p class="heading">Trial of a new teaching method</p>
		<p>An accountancy lecturer writes a web-based tutorial resource to help teach 
			a topic. Students in a large class are told about the resource and allowed 
			access through a login system that records usage. About half of the class 
			use the tutorial.</p>
		<p>To assess whether the tutorial helps students to learn the ideas, the lecturer 
			counts the number of correct answers from the 3 questions about this topic 
			in the final multiple-choice exam.</p>

<p class="eqn"><object data="images/confounded1.svg" width="370" height="192"></object></p>

		<p>Students who used the resource got a higher average mark, but it is impossible 
			to conclude that it was the tutorial resource that caused it.</p>
		<p>Use of the resource is confounded with other characteristics of the students 
			-- only the more motivated students use it and they also study harder. It 
			is impossible to distinguish between motivated students performing better 
			and use of the resource improving marks.</p>
