<p class="heading">Avoiding lurking variables</p>
<p>The varying characteristics of the experimental units can only be lurking variables 
if they are associated with the allocation of treatments to the experimental units.

<p>The method depends on whether these varying characteristics of the experimental 
units are understood and measured before the experiment is conducted.</p>
<p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
<p>When the differing characteristics of the experimental units are unmeasured, 
the best way to avoid association between them and the treatments is to randomly 
allocate treatments to the experimental units. This is called <strong>randomisation</strong> 
of the treatments and the experimental design is called a <strong>completely randomised 
design</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Randomisation does not <strong>guarantee</strong> that there will be no association 
between the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units &mdash; by chance, 
there may be some association. However...</p>

	<p class=heading>Effect of a packer on speed of checkout operators</p>
	<p>In the experiment earlier in this section, the packer was provided for 
		the 8 checkout operators on the Saturday morning shift. This resulted in 
		younger and less experienced packers getting packers, so the effect of the 
		packer was over-estimated.</p>
	<p>Randomising the allocation of packers to 8 of the 16 operators reduces the 
		chance of any association between the treatment and their age or experience.</p>

<p class="heading">Mechanics of randomisation</p>
<p>There are several different ways to randomise allocation of treatments to the experimental units. These all use random numbers either from printed tables or, preferably, generated by a computer. The simplest method is to use a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>If there are <em>n</em> available experimental units,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Number the experimental units from 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
  <li>Write the numbers 1 to <em>n</em> in a spreadsheet column</li>
  <li>Generate random numbers in an adjacent column &mdash; in Excel, type &quot;=RAND()&quot; in each cell.</li>
  <li>Select the two columns and use a menu command to sort the rows into ascending order of the random numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>. If there are two treatments, allocate the first to the experimental units in the top half of the list.</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p>The table below illustrates this method.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="450" height="310">

	<p>The first column shows twelve random numbers, each between 0 and 1, and the list of unit numbers. Click <strong>Sort random numbers</strong> to sort the rows of the table into ascending order of the random numbers. This randomly permutes the unit numbers.<br>
	</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Other ways to randomise treatments (optional)</p>
<p>Although the above method of randomly allocating treatments to the experimental units using a spreadsheet is recommended,  two alternative methods are now described. The first illustrates the randomisation better, whereas the second provides an interesting application of probability.</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p class=heading>Randomisation of training course for 48 sales staff</p>
	<p>The diagram below shows 48 staff, numbered 0 to 47. They will be split into 
		three groups of 16 that will be given different courses to improve sales performance 
		(courses A, B and C).</p>

</applet>
</div>
	<p>Click <strong>Random index</strong> to select a random number between 0 and 
		49. If either 48 or 49 are chosen, click the button again since these numbers 
		do not correspond to any of the 48 staff. <font color="#999999">(We could have 
			allowed the first digit to be 0-9 instead of 0-4, but over half of the resulting 
			numbers would have been rejected for being 48 or higher. By restricting the first 
			digit in the diagram, the simulation runs faster.)</font></p>
	<p>The selected staff member is allocated to course A. Repeatedly click <strong>Random 
		index</strong> to allocate more staff to course A. Once 16 people have been allocated 
		to the group getting course A, staff are randomly allocated to course B. When 
		16 are in the group getting course B, the remainder get course C.</p>
</div>
<p>This method can be rather slow since many random indices are rejected towards the end of the method because treatments have already been allocated to these experimental units.</p>
<p>The final randomisation method works through all experimental units in 
	order, picking a random treatment for each unit in turn. The only complication 
	is that the probabilities used to generate the treatments must be adjusted after 
	each unit gets a treatment. For example, if the first unit gets treatment 
	A, then the probability of the second unit getting treatment A must be reduced 
	a little. (If the same probabilities were used for each successive unit, then 
	too many treatment A's might be allocated.)</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p class=heading>Randomisation of training course to 30 sales staff</p>
	<p>The diagram below illustrates this randomisation method for allocating equal 
		numbers of a group of 30 sales staff to 3 training courses. The first person has 
		equal probabilities for all three courses.</p>

	<p>Click <strong>Generate Next</strong> to select a random value between 0 and 
		1, and hence a random treatment (i.e. course) for the first staff member. (<a href="javascript:showNamedPage('probSim7')">Generation 
			of a random category</a> in this way was described earlier.) If the person gets 
		treatment B, there will only be 10 A's, 9 B's and 10 C's left to allocate for 
		the second person, so the probability of the second staff member getting treatment 
		B should be reduced to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>29</sub>. Click <strong>Update Probs</strong> to adjust the probabilities, then click <strong>Generate Next</strong> again to 
		allocate a treatment to the second person.</p>
	<p>Repeatedly click <strong>Update Probs</strong> and <strong>Generate Next</strong> until all individuals have been allocated to a treatment group.</p>
