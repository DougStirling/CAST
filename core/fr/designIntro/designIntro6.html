<p class="heading">Causes of variation</p>
<p>In a completely randomised experiment, there are two potential reasons why the response in an experiment varies between 
experimental units.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Treatments</dt>
<dd>The experiment is usually conducted specifically to determine how the treatments 
affect the response.</dd>
<dt>Random variation</dt>
<dd>This is a catch-all that refers to all variation in the response that cannot 
be explained in terms of the treatment. It can involve measurement errors and 
differences between the experimental units. </dd>
</dl>
<p>In a completely randomised experiment, <strong>all variation is caused by the 
treatments or is considered as random variation</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Distinguishing the treatment effect and random variation</p>
<p>Experiments are conducted to determine the effect of different treatments. 
It is therefore essential that we can distinguish the treatment effects from random 
variation.</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>There must be enough data to <strong>estimate random variation</strong> separately from variation caused by the treatments. </p>
</div>
<p>The easiest way to do this is with repeat measurements for each treatment &mdash; 
<strong>replication</strong>. Differences between these <strong>replicates</strong> 
are not due to treatment effects so they contain information about the amount 
of random variation.</p>
<p>Using knowledge about the amount of random variation in the experiment, we 
can better assess whether or not observed differences between the treatments are 
more than can be attributed to chance.</p>

<p class=heading>Crop experiment in a field</p>

<p>Researchers want to discover whether two varieties of wheat (A and B) have 
the same yield. One field is available for the experiment and it is know from previous experiments that the fertility and drainage of the soil is uniform over the whole field. The initial design 
for the experiment is shown below &mdash; the varieties were randomly allocated to 
either the left or right side of the field.</p>
