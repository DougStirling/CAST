<p class="heading">Population proportions and probabilities</p>

  <p>Categorical data are often obtained as a random sample from some finite population. For example,</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>A farmer might randomly sample 50 cabbages from a field and examine whether each sampled cabbage is infested by catterpillars or other pests and diseases.</li>
 		<li>A large company might randomly sample 100 or the invoices that were posted for services in the previous month and determine the proportion that were paid within 3 weeks.</li>
  	<li>A national education department might randomly sample 60 high school teachers and ask them whether they had been verbally or physically abused by students in the previous year.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We concentrate on a single category which we will call <strong>success</strong> and we collectively call the other categories <strong>failures</strong>. The 
	population proportion of successes is denoted by π. It is also the <strong>probability</strong> that a single randomly selected value from the population is a success.</p>
  <p>In other situations, categorical data are not physically sampled from a real population, but we can still consider them to be sampled from an underlying process in which the probability of success is π.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>A restaurant introduces a new main course to its menu and records the number of diners choosing this dish. The probability that a diner will choose the new main course is π.</li>
 		<li>A biologist sprays a weak concentration of insecticide on 50 beetles and determines the proportion still alive after 1 hour. The probability of this application killing a beetle is π.</li>
	</ul>
  <p>We will not further distinguish between these two situations &mdash;  in both cases, we are interested in estimating an underlying probability, π. Although it is more general to treat π as a probability, it is  usually easier to interpret π as a 'population proportion'.</p>
  <p class="heading">Parameter estimate and error</p>
	<p>The 
		sample proportion of successes is denoted by <em><font color="#000000">p</font></em> and is an estimate of the population proportion, <font color="#000000">π</font>.</p>
	<p class=eqn><object data="images/pEqn.svg" width="246" height="35"></object></p>
	<p>As in other situations in which a population parameter is estimated, there will 
		be an estimation error,</p>
	<p class=eqn><em><font color="#000000">error</font></em> <font color="#000000">&nbsp; 
		= &nbsp; <em>p</em> - π 
		</font> </p>
	<p>Since <font color="#000000">π</font> 
		is unknown, we cannot find a numerical value for the error, but we know that the error 
		has a distribution. In the next page, we will show how to find the error distribution.</p>

		<p class="heading">Rice survey</p>

		
    <p>As part of a survey of rice producers in Sri Lanka, 36 farmers were randomly 
			selected from 4 villages. Each sampled farmer was asked about the variety 
			of rice that he used and the varieties were categorised as 'Old', 'Traditional' 
			or 'New'. The 36 categorical values are described by the following frequency 
		table.</p>
		<center>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
        <tr>
          <th align="LEFT" bgcolor="white">Old varieties</th>
          <td align="RIGHT" bgcolor="white">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th align="LEFT" bgcolor="white">Traditional varieties</th>
          <td align="RIGHT" bgcolor="white">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th align="LEFT" bgcolor="white">New varieties</th>
          <td align="RIGHT" bgcolor="white">4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th align="LEFT">Total&nbsp;farmers</th>
          <td align="RIGHT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
	  </center>
		<p>We will concentrate here on the 'Old' varieties of rice. We want to estimate 
		  the proportion of farmers in this part of Sri Lanka who use these old varieties 
		  &mdash; the population parameter, π. 
		  However we only have a small sample of farmers and our best estimate is 
		  the sample proportion, <sup>17</sup>/<sub>36</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.472.</p>
		<center>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
        <tr>
          <td align="center"><strong>How accurate is this estimate?<strong></strong></strong></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
	  </center>
		<p>Since π is unknown here, the estimation error cannot be determined.</p>
		
    <p class=heading>Simulation: Error distribution</p>

	  
    <p>The diagram below simulates preference data in which a sample of 100 people 
      say which of two types of coffee is preferred. The values could equally 
      be from any 'success/failure' binomial scenario.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="550" height="450">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="stdErrorProg.PropnErrorDistnApplet">
<param name="catVarName" value="Preferred coffee">
<param name="catLabels" value="#Prefer A# #Prefer B#">
<param name="random" value="100 0.7 0.3">
<param name="errorName" value="Error in estimate">
<param name="errorAxis" value="-0.20 0.20 -0.2 0.1">
<param name="maxEstimate" value="-9.999">
<param name="customText" value="Target parameter=Target parameter#Estimate from sample=Estimate from sample#Peek at population=Peek at population">
</applet>
</div>

			
		
    <p>Our sample of 100 values provides an estimate of the population proportion 
      preferring <em>Coffee A</em>, but the error cannot be found unless we know 
      the value of π.</p>
    <p>Since this is a simulation, we can 'cheat'. Click <strong>Peek at population</strong> 
			to see the population proportion preferring Coffee A and evaluate the estimation 
			error.</p>
    <p>Click <strong>Another sample</strong> several times to repeat the simulation 
      and build up the distribution of the estimation error. </p>
    <center>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
        <tr> 
          <td><div class="centred"><strong>The error distribution describes the 
							likely size of errors from this type of estimate.</strong></div></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>
		
    <p>Note that this is <strong>not</strong> a practical way to obtain the error 
			distribution since we can rarely take multiple samples from the population. 
			However it does illustrate the concept of an error distribution.</p>
