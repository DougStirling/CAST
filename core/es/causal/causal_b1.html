<p class="heading">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>In most data sets, we are interested in the relationship between the variables. 
This is most obviously the case when the data consist of two numerical variables 
(correlation and least squares give information about the relationship) or two 
categorical variables (a contingency table and conditional proportions help show 
the relationship).</p>
<p class="heading">Groups and relationships</p>
<p>Questions about differences between two or more groups can <strong>also</strong> 
be expressed in terms of relationships between variables if group membership is 
represented by a categorical variable. For example, if we have collected data 
about incomes from a sample of males and a sample of females, we would be interested 
in comparing these two groups &mdash; i.e. the relationship between income and gender.</p>

<dd>Is there a relationship between temperature and bruises per apple?</dd>
<dt>Are the blood pressures of adults with several brothers or sisters different 
from those of adults who are only children?</dt>
<dd>Is there a relationship between number of siblings and blood pressure?</dd>
<dt>Which of three different varieties of corn has greatest yield?</dt>
<dd>Is there a relationship between corn variety and yield?</dd>
<dt>Are male sparrows heavier than female sparrows?</dt>
<dd>Is there a relationship between gender and weight in sparrows?</dd>

<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>
