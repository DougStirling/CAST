<p class="heading">In large data sets, jittering the crosses helps show density</p>

<p>A simple dot plot is often adequate for small data sets. However in larger data sets,
the crosses often overlap. Indeed, if several crosses
coincide, they become indistinguishable from a single cross, so high
density may be obscured.</p>

<p>One solution is to randomly move the crosses perpendicularly to the axis in order
to separate them somewhat. This is called <strong>jittering</strong> the points.</p>

  <p><font color="#666666">(You should rely on a computer to do the jittering for 
		you, but it could be done by hand by rolling a 6- or 10-sided die for each 
		cross to determine its jittering in millimetres.)</font></p>

		<p class="heading">Survival time of businesses</p>

		
<p>A researcher is interested in how long small businesses stay in operation. 
As part of the study, 120 businesses that closed down during the previous year 
were investigated. The last registered director of each company was contacted 
and asked about how long it had been in business. (The information was obtained 
from local government sources if nobody from the company could be contacted.)</p>
		<p>The dot plot below shows the ages of the companies against a horizontal 
			axis.</p>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider to jitter the points. <strong>Click</strong> 
the button on the right to change the jittering &mdash; i.e. to change the random 
vertical position of the crosses.</p>

<p>Only enough jittering should be used to separate the high density of crosses &mdash; 
moving the slider about half way is best for the data above. Without jittering,
too many crosses overlap to allow us to assess the distribution of values.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<th align="CENTER">Note that the vertical positions of the crosses have no importance 
-- the vertical movement of crosses is 'random' and is only intended to separate 
overlapping crosses.</th>
</tr>
</table>

</div>

<p>An alternative solution to the problem of overlapping crosses will be described on
the next page.</p>
