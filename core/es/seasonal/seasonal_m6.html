<p class="heading">Forecasting the individual components</p>
	<p>We have seen how to split a seasonal time series into four components,</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#009; font-weight:bold"><span class="eqn" style="color:#009; font-weight:bold">Data</span>&nbsp; = &nbsp; <span class="eqn" style="color:#009; font-weight:bold">Seasonal effect &nbsp; + &nbsp; </span>Trend &nbsp; + &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; + &nbsp; Residual </p>
	<p>The main benefit from separately identifying the four components is that 
		each of the first three components can be forecast into the future.</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#009; font-weight:bold"><span class="eqn" style="color:#009; font-weight:bold">Forecast</span>&nbsp; = &nbsp; <span class="eqn" style="color:#009; font-weight:bold">Seasonal effect &nbsp; + &nbsp; </span>Trend forecast&nbsp; + &nbsp; Cyclical forecast</p>
	<p>The three components of the forecast are:</p>
 <dl> 
  <dt>Seasonal effect</dt>
		<dd>We forecast that the same seasonal effects will hold into the future.</dd>
		<dt>Trend</dt>
		<dd>If the trend is modelled with a linear or quadratic model, any future 
			time can be inserted into the model to obtain a forecast of the trend.</dd>
		<dt>Cyclical</dt>
		<dd>If an autoregressive model is used to model the cyclical component, we 
      can forecast the cyclical component one time period into the future by applying 
      the model to the final deseasonalised, detrended value. The model is then 
      applied sequentially to the forecast to extend it into the future. The cyclical 
      forecasts usually tail away quickly to zero.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>By separately forecasting these three components, we can obtain more accuracy.</p>

		<p>Select the checkbox <strong>Seasonal</strong>. The seasonal component is 
			removed from the top series and added to the bottom, and is forecast for 
			two years into the future.</p>
		<p>De-select <strong>Seasonal</strong> and select <strong>Trend</strong>. 
			There is very little trend, but a quadratic trend is forecast into the future in the bottom half of the 
			diagram.</p>
		<p>Finally select <strong>Cyclical</strong> on its own. Since there is minimal autocorrelation, this component is also small, but the cyclical component 
			is now forecast in the bottom half of the diagram.</p>
		<p>Finally, select all of <strong>Seasonal</strong>, <strong>Trend</strong> 
			and <strong>Cyclical</strong>. The resulting forecasts in the bottom of 
			the diagram are close to optimum.</p>
		<div class="boxed">
      <p>Since the trend and autocorrelation are negligible, forecasting temperatures from only the seasonal component would be equally accurate.</p>
