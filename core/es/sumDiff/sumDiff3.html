<p class="heading">Different standard deviations</p>

<p>Similar results to these on the previous page  
also hold if <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> have different standard deviations. The table below generalises the formulae on that page.</p>
<p class=eqn><object data="images/sumDiffSD.svg" width="250" height="161" alt="eqn"></object></p>

<p>Note that, as before, the difference between the variables has the same standard deviation as their 
sum. </p>

<p class="heading">In terms of variances</p>
<p>The formula for the standard deviation can be remembered more easily if expressed 
  in terms of the <strong>variances</strong> of the three quantities rather than 
  their standard deviations. (Remember that the variance is simply the square of 
  the standard deviation.)</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Illustration</p>
<p>The diagram below is similar to that on the previous page but the standard deviations of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> can be separately changed by dragging the short vertical lines above their normal distributions. (The means can also be adjusted by draggin the longer vertical lines.)</p>

<p>Again investigate how the distributions of the sum and difference of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> are affected by the two means and standard deviations.</p>
<p>In particular, note that:</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>The standard deviations of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>X</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>X</em><sub>2</sub> are equal and are greater than both σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>
<p class="heading">Heights of husband-and-wife pairs</p>
<p>The diagram below simulates sampling a husband and wife from a population where 
the husband's height is normal with mean 1.85 metres and the wife's height is 
normal with mean 1.7 metres. It is assumed that there is no tendency for tall males to marry tall 
females and vice versa &mdash; the male and female heights are <strong>independent</strong> &mdash; and that the 
distributions for both sexes have standard deviation 0.1 metres.</p>
<p>The distributions on the top right show the clearance of a randomly selected 
male and female from a door frame that is 2.1 metres high. These distributions 
also have standard deviation 0.1 metres.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then click <strong>Take sample</strong> a 
few times to select different couples. </p>

<p><font color="#666666">(Click on any cross in the jittered dot plots to display the
husband and wife that gave rise to it.)</font></p>

<p>The mean male height is 0.15 metres greater than the mean female height, so 
the distribution of differences (male minus female) is centred on 0.15 metres. 
Observe also that the difference has greater standard deviation than either the 
male or female heights on their own.</p>
