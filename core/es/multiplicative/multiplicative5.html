<p class="heading">A classification of time series</p>

  <p>We end this chapter with a brief classification of time series data. Although 
    it is useful to recognise the differen types of time series, all analysed 
    with the same statistical techniques (at least at introductory level).</p>
	<p>Time series data arise in various different contexts.</p>
  <dl>
  <dt><strong>Measurements relating to events that occur at discrete times</strong></dt>
    <dd>e.g. the dividend paid out each year on British Airways shares</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Regular snapshots of a continuous process</strong></dt>
  <dd>e.g. the Consumer Price Index at the end of each month</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Quantities that are aggregated over a period</strong></dt>
  <dd>e.g. the numbers of admissions to a hospital each day, or monthly energy
  consumption</dd>
</dl>

<p>Further, the measurements themselves may be of various different types.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Continuous</strong></dt>
    <dd>e.g. fat content in homogenised milk produced by a bottling factory</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Discrete</strong></dt>
  <dd>e.g. number of complaints received by a department store each day</dd>
</dl>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, we do not need to further distinguish between the different 
    types of time series at this level of course.</p>
