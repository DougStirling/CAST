<p class="heading">Standard deviation of a sample mean</p>

<p>Earlier in this section, we presented a formula for the standard deviation of 
a sample mean,</p>
<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position:relative; top:12px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline"></span>
</p>

<p>This formula, with σ 
replaced by <em>s</em>, 
can estimate the standard deviation of the mean from a single random sample.</p>
<p class="heading">Independent random samples</p>
<p>This formula is only accurate if the sample is collected in such a way that 
each successive value is unaffected by other values that have already been collected. 
For example, if values are sampled at random <strong>with replacement</strong> 
from a population, any population value has the same chance of being selected 
whatever values were previously selected. This is called an <strong>independent</strong> 
random sample.</p>

<tr> 
<td><strong>When statisticians use the term <em>random sample</em>, independence 
is implied unless dependence is otherwise mentioned.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="heading">Dependent random samples</p>
<p>When the sample values depend on each other, they are said to be <strong>dependent</strong>.</p>
<p>The worst type of dependency arises through bad sample design. For convenience 
or to save money, values are often sampled from 'adjacent' individuals. Since 
these values tend to be similar, there is less variability in the sample than 
in the underlying population &mdash; the sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>, 
underestimates σ.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the mean of such a dependent sample is more variable 
than the mean of an independent sample of the same size. For both reasons,</p>

<p>The formula</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" width="64" height="32"></p>
<p> can badly underestimate the variability (and hence accuracy) of the sample 
mean of dependent random samples.</p>
</strong></td>

<p>Always check that a random sample is independently selected from the whole 
population before using the formula for the standard deviation of the sample mean.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Independent random sample of incomes</p>
<p>In the following diagram, ten male householders are sampled from a town in 
order to estimate the town's average income.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="550" height="400">

</div>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> once to see the incomes from an independent 
random sample of ten males from the town. The cross on the right shows the sample 
mean income. A normal distribution is also shown whose standard deviation was 
obtained from the formula above .</p>
<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> about 20 more times and observe that the 
sample means have a distribution whose spread conforms (roughly) to the standard 
deviations that are obtained from the individual samples.</p>
<p class="heading">Sampling from one street in the town</p>
<p>Now click <strong>Reset</strong>, drag the slider to give a correlation of 
0.9, and take a single sample. This shows what might be obtained if a single street 
was selected from the town and the ten sampled males were all from this street. 
(Data collection would be cheaper.) Note that the sampled incomes are similar 
since the individuals come from the same area of the town. The formula therefore 
predicts a lower standard deviation for the sample mean than before.</p>
<p>Take about 20 more samples and observe that the sample means are actually <strong>more</strong> 
variable than for an independent random sample. For both reasons, the standard 
deviation from the formula badly overestimates the accuracy of a sample mean.</p>

<p><strong>With all 20 samples visible, drag the slider to observe both effects 
better.</strong></p>
<div class="boxed"><p style="text-align:left;">The more dependent the sample, ...</p>
<ul>
	<li>the greater the actual variability of the sample means, and</li>
	<li>the lower the predicted standard deviation.</li>
</ul>
