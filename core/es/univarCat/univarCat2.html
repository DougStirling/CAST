<p class="heading">Ordering categories of ordinal and nominal variables</p>
	<p>Some categorical variables have a natural ordering of their categories. These 
		are called <strong>ordinal</strong> categorical variables. For example, many 
		questionnaires request responses to statements on a five-point scale between 
		'strongly agree' and 'strongly disagree'. For such variables, the categories 
		on a bar chart should be shown in this natural order.</p>
	<p>When there is no natural ordering of the categories (a <strong>nominal</strong> 
		categorical variable), the order of the categories in a frequency table or 
		bar chart is arbitrary. For example, if school children are asked to pick 
		their favourite subject, there is no natural way to order the subjects English, 
		Mathematics and Music and these categories can be placed in any order on a 
		bar chart.</p>
	<center>
		<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">

						is rarely best.</strong></div></td>

	<p class="heading">Detecting 'important' categories</p>
	<p>For nominal categorical variables, it is often useful to arrange the categories 
		in decreasing order of their frequencies. When the bars of a bar chart are 
		organised in this way, the diagram is called a <strong>Pareto diagram</strong>. 
		The initial bars in the diagram have the highest frequencies and are often 
		the most 'important' ones.</p>
	<p>Pareto diagrams are particularly useful in industrial quality control and 
		quality improvement where information is collected about the causes of problems 
		in manufacturing processes. These causes are usually categorical and a Pareto 
		diagram highlights the most important ones.</p>
	<p>The Pareto diagram is named after an Italian economist in the late 1800's 
		who found that about 80 percent of the wealth of a region was concentrated 
		in less than 20 percent of the population. This rule-of-thumb has been adapted 
		to quality improvement, giving the <strong>Pareto principle</strong> that</p>
<table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>A large percentage of instances of any problem result from a small 
percentage of the possible causes.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>A line is usually added to a Pareto diagram showing the <strong>cumulative</strong> 
proportions for the different causes. For the <em>i</em>'th cause, the height 
of the line gives the proportion of problems from <strong>any</strong> of the 
<em>i</em> most common causes.</p>

<p class="heading">Defective cereal boxes</p>

<p>A manufacturer of breakfast cereals has received complaints about defective 
boxes of corn flakes being shipped to supermarkets. The output from one week was 
checked for defects and the following table shows the main reasons for boxes being 
rejected as defective.</p>

<table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr> 
<th>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reason for defective box&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
<th>&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of boxes&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>

<p>There is no natural ordering of the defects, so we can reorder them in any way. Select <strong>Decreasing frequencies</strong> from the pop-up menu. After reordering, the most important reasons for the defective boxes are on the left and the least important are at the right.</p>
<p class="heading">Cumulative proportions</p>
<p>The diagram below completes the Pareto diagram with the cumulative proportions.</p>

<div class="centred">

</div>

<p>Click on the bar for <strong>Dirty </strong> to stack the bars for the three 
most common causes. The cumulative proportion line goes through the top of this 
stack, so it shows the proportion of boxes that were rejected for these three 
causes. Click on other bars to read off other cumulative proportions.</p>
<p>Finally, click the checkbox <strong>Separate scale for cumulative propns</strong> 
to expand the scaling of the individual bars of the bar chart and therefore make 
comparisons easier. Note that a different scale is used for the cumulative proportions 
(on the right) and the individual proportions (on the left).</p>
