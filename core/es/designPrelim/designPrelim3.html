<p class="heading">Ethical issues arise</p>

<p>There are a few practicalities that complicate experimentation with human subjects.
For ethical reasons, experiments involving potential danger to the subjects are not
possible. Even if there is no known danger, the subjects should be aware of what is
involved in the experiment and must give informed consent.
</p>

<p class=heading> Controls</p>

<p>There are many instances where an experiment is intended to measure the effect
of a particular treatment, such as the improvement of a medical condition caused by
administration of a particular drug. A naive experimenter may record the value of some
variable (e.g. concentration of some chemical in the blood) before medication is commenced
and also after the medication has been used for a week. However any improvement in
the condition may have resulted simply from the passage of time and it may not be
related to the drug. Time is a lurking variable that is confounded with the treatment.
</p>

<p>In order to assess the effect of the treatment, some
(randomly selected) subjects who have not received the treatment should also be
included in the study &mdash; differences between the improvements of the two groups can
then be credited to the treatment. Subjects who receive no treatment are called
<strong>controls</strong>.
</p>

<p class=heading> Placebos</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the act of administering a treatment to a human subject may itself
affect the response, irrespective of the treatment effect. For example, if a drug
is being assessed for its ability to reduce headaches, the knowledge that medication
has been administered may make the subject feel better, even if the drug has no active
ingredient.
</p>

<p>To avoid the psychological effect of the treatment on the subject being confounded 
with the effect of the drug, an indistinguishable 'treatment' with no effect may 
be given to the control group of subjects; this is called a <strong>placebo</strong>. 
For example, two batches of pills of similar size and taste may be prepared, with 
only one batch containing the active ingredient being assessed. Any difference 
between the control group and the treatment group can therefore be attributed 
to the treatment. </p>

<p class=heading> Double-blind experiments</p>

<p>A further complication may arise when the measured response from each subject
may be affected by knowledge of the treatment applied. If the experimenter knows
which treatment has been applied to each experimental unit, there may be a
subconscious tendency to systematically over- or under-assess one treatment.
To avoid this potential problem, the experimenter may be unaware of which
experimental units received which treatment until after the experiment.
</p>

<p>The experiment is called <strong>double-blind</strong> if neither the experimenter 
not the subject knows which treatment has been applied. For example, a third party 
may randomly decide which of two drugs will be given to each subject, and package 
the appropriate pills for each subject in unlabelled containers. The experimenter 
would administer the treatments and record results without knowing which subjects 
were receiving which treatments. Again, the aim is to ensure that other factors 
do not act as lurking variables to confound comparisons of the treatments. </p>
