<p class=heading>Distributions</p>
<p>When an abstract population is imagined to underly a data set, it  often contains an infinite number of values. For example, consider the lifetimes of a sample of light bulbs. The population of <strong>possible</strong> failure times contains <strong>all</strong> values greater than zero, and this includes an infinite number of values. Moreover, some of these possible values will be more likely than others.</p>
<p>This kind of underlying population is called a <strong>distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>The notion of sampling from an infinite population is difficult, so we will now illustrate it in a different context  as an extension of sampling from a finite population.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Location of cows in a field</p>

<p>Consider a cow that can freely move within a field. We observe its location in the field at six times so our data are   six 'locations' for the cow.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="450" height="450">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="samplingProg.CowInFieldApplet">
<param name="noOfCows" value="6">
<param name="customText" value="Grid=Grid#Coarse=Coarse#Fine=Fine#Very fine=Very fine#Infinite=Infinite">
</applet>
</div>

<p>Initially consider  the field being split into a 5x5 grid giving a population of 25 possible locations for the cow. The six positions at which the cow was observed are a random sample of 6 from this population. Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to see possible locations using this model.</p>
<p>Use the pop-up menu to change the grid to a 10x10 grid and then a 30x30 grid to allow a finer specification of the cow locations. In both cases, we are still selecting samples (with replacement) from a finite population.</p>
<p>Finally select <strong>Infinite</strong> from the pop-up menu to continue this refinement of the grid to its extreme, allowing the cow locations to be <strong>anywhere</strong> within the field &mdash; an infinite population. Clicking <strong>Select sample</strong> selects a random sample of locations from this infinite population.</p>
</div>

<p>In the illustration above, we assumed that all possible locations in the field were equally likely. The idea of a distribution also allows for some possible values to be more likely than others. For example, the cow may be more likely to be in some parts of the field above than others.</p>
