<p class="heading">How much data do I need to collect?</p>

<p>This is one of the most common questions that statistical consultants are asked. 
Data collection is expensive, so there is a clear desire to keep sample sizes 
as low as possible. However insufficient data means that the parameters of interest 
cannot be estimated accurately enough.</p>
<p>Consider estimation of a population mean, µ, 
from a random sample of size <em>n</em>. A 95% confidence interval will be of 
the form</p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/ciMean/images/plusMinusTSE.gif" width="93" height="32"> 
  </p>
<p>If we want our estimate to be within <em>k</em> of µ 
with probability 0.95, then we need <em>n</em> to be large enough that</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/ciExtra/images/meanInequality.gif" width="105" height="29"> </p>
<p>Provided we can make a reasonable guess at the likely value of the sample standard 
deviation, <em>s</em>, 
it is possible to determine the necessary sample size by trial-and-error in the 
above inequality.</p>

<p class="heading">How many plots of corn should be planted?</p>

<p>Researchers want to estimate the yield (in bushels per acre) of a new variety 
of corn. The corn will be planted in plots and, from previous experience with 
other varieties of corn, it is expected that the yield in a plot will be just 
over 100 bushels per acre with standard deviation about 8.</p>

<th align="CENTER">How many plots should be planted to estimate the mean yield 
to within 2 bushels per acre with probability 0.95?</th>
</tr>

<p>The following diagram helps with the calculations.</p>

<p>Drag the sample size slider until the '±' value is less than 2. Verify

<p class="heading">Obtaining the sample size by solving an equation</p>

<p>Provided the sample size will be reasonably large, it is possible to replace 
the t-value in the above inequality by 1.96. For our estimate to be within <em>k</em> 
of µ 
with probability 0.95, we therefore need</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/ciExtra/images/meanInequality2.gif" width="94" height="29"></p>
<p>This inequality can be re-written in the form</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/ciExtra/images/nForMean.gif" width="99" height="41"> </p>
<p>In practice, it is best to increase <em>n</em> a little over this value in 
case the sample standard deviation was wrongly guessed.</p>
