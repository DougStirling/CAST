<p class="heading">Dangers of over-interpretation</p>
	<p>Very strong autocorrelation in a time series can result in apparent trends, 
		even when there is no real trend underlying the series. An important example 
		of this is the 'random walk' model for share price data. Autocorrelation and 
		trend are especially difficult to distinguish in short time series. You should 
		therefore be wary of extrapolating a trend into the future if there is high 
		autocorrelation.</p>

<div class="diagram">

		<p>The diagram below shows a time series that has been artificially generated 
			with <strong>no trend</strong> and with successive values that are not autocorrelated.</p>

		<p>Click <strong>New sample</strong> a few times to observe the types of pattern 
			that might be observed with an uncorrelated time series.</p>
		<p>Drag the slider to increase the autocorrelation coefficient to 0.95 then 
      take a few more samples to observe the types of pattern that may be found 
      in autocorrelated data. Observe that some series appear to exhibit trend 
      even though the none underlies the data.</p>
		<p><font color="#666666">(Try making the autocorrelation coefficient negative. 
			With negative autocorrelation, positive values tend to be followed by negative 
			ones and vice versa. This type of series is rarely encountered in practice, 
			although it can happen when there is an exaggerated feedback mechanism causing 
			automatic adjustment towards an equilibrium level.)</font></p>
