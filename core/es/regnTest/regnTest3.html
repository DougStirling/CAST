<p class="heading">Strength of a relationship</p>

<p>The strength of the relationship between two variables, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, 
is usually summarised by their <a href="javascript:'correlation2')">correlation 
coefficient, <em>r</em></a>.</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/correlation/images/corrDefn2.gif" width="213" height="67"> 
</p>
<p>When the data are sampled from some population, there is a corresponding underlying 
population correlation coefficient, ρ, 
that <em>r</em> approximates. (ρ is the Greek letter <em>r</em>, pronounced 'rho'.) The sample correlation coefficient 
<em>r</em> is an estimate of the unknown population parameter, ρ.</p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>As the sample size increases, <em>r</em> becomes a more accurate estimate 
of ρ, 
but <font color="#FF0000">its distribution is always centred near ρ</font>.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The size of the correlation coefficient is therefore not dependent on the sample 
size. </p>
<p class="heading">Strength of <font color="#990000">evidence</font> for a relationship</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the correlation coefficient, <em>r</em>, 
and the p-value for testing whether there is a relationship between <em>X</em> 
and <em>Y</em>. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Correlation coefficient</dt>
<dd>Describes the strength of the relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em></dd>
<dt>The p-value for testing whether <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are related</dt>
<dd>Describes the strength of <strong>evidence</strong> for whether <em>X</em> 
and <em>Y</em> are related <strong>at all</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>It is important not to confuse these two values when interpreting the p-value 
for a test.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the p-value is close to zero, it does <strong>not</strong> necessarily 
mean that there is a strong relationship. If the sample size is very large, the 
relationship might be weak, but there is enough data to be sure that there is 
<strong>some</strong> relationship.</li>
<li>If the p-value is large, it does <strong>not</strong> necessarily mean that 
there cannot be a strong relationship. The sample size might just be too small 
to detect it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The interpretation of the p-value is helped by giving an alternative formula 
for the test statistic,</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/regnTest/images/standardisedSlope2.gif" width="69" height="48"></p>
<p>This can be rewritten in terms of the correlation coefficient, <em>r</em>, 
and the sample size as...</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/regnTest/images/tFromR.gif" width="98" height="38"> 
</p>
<p>Since the p-value describes how far <em>t</em> is from zero,</p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>The p-value depends on <font color="#FF0000">both <em>r</em> and the 
sample size, <em>n</em></font>.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If <em>r</em> stays the same, the test statistic becomes further from zero 
(and the p-value for the test therefore becomes smaller) as the sample size increases.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The following examples illustrate how both the sample size and the correlation 
coefficient affect the p-value.</p>
<p>In the data set at the top left, there is no evidence of a relationship between 
the variables &mdash; a correlation coefficient of 0.24 could easily have arisen by 
chance even if the variables were not related at all.</p>

<p class=eqn><object data="images/rnEffect.svg" width="583" height="466"></object></p>

<p>The data set on the top right has the same correlation coefficient, 0.24. However 
its sample size is much higher and a correlation coefficient this far from zero 
is now very unlikely, so the p-value is small. There is almost certainly a relationship 
between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, even though the relationship is weak.</p>
<p>With a sample size of 30, the relationship would need to be stronger for us 
to detect it. The data set on the bottom left shows that <em>r</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.63 
gives strong evidence of a relationship with a data set of this size.</p>
