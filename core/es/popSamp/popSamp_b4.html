<p class="heading">Effect of sample size on sampling error</p>

<p>The larger the sample size, the smaller the sampling error. However when the 
population is large, sampling a small proportion of the population may still give 
accurate estimates. </p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Sampling error depends much more strongly on the sample size than 
on the proportion of the population that is sampled.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For example, a sample of 10 from a population of 10,000 people will estimate 
the proportion of males almost as accurately as a sample of size 10 from a population 
of 100.</p>

<td><strong>The cost savings from using a sample instead of a full census can 
be huge.</strong></td>

<p class="heading">Cabbage varieties</p>

<p>A market gardener plants a field of 900 cabbages and notices that there are 
two different varieties of cabbage growing &mdash; seeds of the two varieties must 
have been mixed before planting. Variety A is known to be less resistant to dry 
conditions and will need to be harvested earlier, so the farmer wants to discover 
the proportion of this variety. </p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates how sampling can be used to estimate this proportion. 
Cabbages in the population of Variety A are shown as blue crosses.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="400" height="250">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="designProg.SamplingApplet">

</div>

<p>Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> to randomly select 180 of the 
900 cabbages in the field. We would use the sample proportion of Variety A as 
an estimate of the population proportion (an unknown in a real field).</p>
<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few more times. The sample proportion 
is usually within 0.04 of the population proportion, and this would be accurate 
enough for the farmer to assess the work involved in harvesting this variety early.</p>

<p>The seed merchant who supplied the cabbage seeds above decides
to test a container of 1,000,000 cabbage seeds.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="500" height="170">

</div>

<p>Use the button <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times. The difference between
the sample proportion of seeds of Variety A and the population proportion (0.200) is the
sampling error.
</p>

<p>Use the pop-up menu to investigate how the sample size affects the accuracy
of the estimate. You should observe that the sampling error is usually smaller when
the sample size is large.
</p>

<p>In practice, a sample size of 1000 seeds would give the seed merchant a sufficiently
accurate estimate of the proportion that are of Variety A. It is certainly hard to
imagine a situation where more than 1% of this population would need to be sampled!</p>
