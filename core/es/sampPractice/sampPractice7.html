<p class=heading>Methods of obtaining sample information</p>

<p>Whatever sampling scheme is used, information must be obtained from each individual 
selected in the sample. When sampling items produced by a factory or trees in 
a forest, the process of obtaining measurements from each item is usually fairly 
straightforward.</p>
<p>However there are various options for collecting information from human populations. 
Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p class=heading>Telephone</p>

<p>Telephone surveys are relatively cheap to conduct and, therefore, sample sizes
can be greater.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-response can be high</li>
  <li>Coverage error is small (though some adjustment is need to take account
  		of different household sizes).</li>
  <li>The number of questions must be kept very small.</li>
  <li>Inexpensive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Telephone numbers may be selected at random from a telephone book but this misses unlisted
numbers, so random dialing is often used.
</p>

<p class=heading>Mailed questionnaire</p>

<p>In a postal survey, individuals would be randomly selected from electoral rolls 
or other population lists. Alternatively, questionnaires might be delivered by 
hand to the mailboxes of a sample of houses.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-response is very high.</li>
  <li>Costs are higher than in a telephone survey.</li>
  <li>Mailed questionnaires can contain more questions than telephone surveys.</li>
</ul>

<p class=heading>Interviewer</p>

<p>Interviewers who approach respondents at home are most likely to get responses for
long questionnaires.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lowest non-response and other sampling errors.</li>
  <li>Interviewers must be well trained to reduce interviewer error.</li>
  <li>Most expensive.</li>
  <li>Questionnaires can be fairly long.</li>
</ul>

<p>Houses are rarely selected at random. Often streets are randomly selected and every
5th or 10th house in the street is approached. This is called a <strong>systematic
sample</strong>.
</p>

<p class=heading>Street corner</p>

<p>Some surveys are conducted by approaching people in busy shopping centres or
similar public places.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large coverage errors.</li>
  <li>Least expensive and therefore widely used.</li>
  <li>Questionnaires must be small.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce coverage errors, a <strong>quota sample</strong> is often used. Each 
interviewer is told to interview fixed numbers of old, young, male, female, etc. 
respondents. The proportion with each characteristic is chosen to reflect the 
corresponding proportion in the target population. It is much harder to assess 
the accuracy of quota samples than the sampling schemes that were described at 
the start of this section.</p>

<p class=heading>Self-selected</p>

<p>Phone-in or mail-in surveys are often conducted by radio stations and magazines. The
respondents are usually so unrepresentative that the results are meaningless. These types
of survey should be avoided.
