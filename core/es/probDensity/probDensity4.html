<p class=heading>Histograms and probability density functions</p>

<p>The distribution of values in a infinite categorical or discrete population can be displayed in the same way as a sample or finite population &mdash; with a bar chart. Finite samples of continuous numerical values are often displayed using histograms and these can also be used as graphical displays of infinite populations.</p>
<p class="eqn"><object data="images/histogram.svg" width="192" height="154"></object></p>
<p>However we noted before that the  exact shape of a sample histogram depends on the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('density3')">choice of classes</a> that were used to draw it. Class width is usually reduced as much as possible to retain a fairly smooth histogram shape. For an infinite population, this reduction in class width can be taken to its extreme, resulting in a smooth histogram called a <strong>probability density function</strong>. This is often abbreviated to a <strong>pdf</strong>.</p>
<p class="eqn"><object data="images/pdf.svg" width="192" height="154"></object></p>
<p>Probability density functions are still essentially histograms and share all properties of histograms.</p>

<p>Take a few samples to observe the variability in the shape of the histogram of samples of size 50.</p>
<p>Increase the sample size to 500, then 5000, and take more samples. As expected from the law of large numbers, the proportion in each class becomes less variable.</p>
<p>With the larger sample size, the classes can be made narrower without giving the histogram a jagged appearance. Make the classes <strong>Narrower</strong> until the histograms start to appear jagged.</p>
<p>Increase the sample size to 50,000 and note that the class width can be made still narrower.</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>With large samples, the shape of the histogram is approaching a smooth curve.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally change the sample size to <strong>Infinite</strong> and note that the histogram can now be made arbitrarily narrow, resulting in a smooth curve.</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>The limiting 'infinite sample' smooth histogram is the <strong>probability density function</strong> of the population.<br>
