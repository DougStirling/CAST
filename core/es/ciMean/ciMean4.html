<p class="heading">Unknown population standard deviation</p>

<p>If we know the value of the population standard deviation, σ, 
an interval estimate of the form</p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/ciMean/images/ci.gif" width="87" height="31"> 
  </p>
<p>has a confidence level of 0.95 &mdash; i.e. it is a 95% confidence interval.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<th align="CENTER">In practice however, the value of σ 
is rarely known.</th>

<p>It is tempting to simply replace σ in the formula by its sample equivalent, <em>s</em>.</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/ciMean/images/bad95CI.gif" width="86" height="31"> 
</p>
<p>However the confidence level for an interval of this form is lower than 95% 
-- the extra variability caused by estimating σ means that it is less likely that the interval will include µ. 
When the sample size is large, the confidence level is close to 95% but the confidence 
level can be much lower if the sample size is small.</p>
<p>A confidence interval of this form would therefore give a misleading impression 
of accuracy &mdash; we would be claiming to be 95% confident that it included µ, 
but the true confidence level would be lower.</p>

<p>The diagram below initially shows a random sample of <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;30 
values from a normal population with µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;12 
and σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. 
It can show interval estimates calculated using σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 
or using the sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>, 
depending on the setting of the checkbox <strong>Use sample sd</strong>.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> and take about 100 samples. Observe that...</p>

<ul>
<li>When using intervals based on known σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 
about 95% include µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;12. 
(Theory states that the probability is exactly 0.95.)</li>
<li>Intervals based on <em>s</em> 
are similar and again about 95% include µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;12. 
The long-term probability is close to 0.95, but slightly less &mdash; not enough to 
be noticeable in this type of simulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reduce the sample size to 5 and take another 100 samples. Observe now that...</p>

<ul>
<li>When using intervals based on known σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 
about 95% still include µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.</li>
<li>When the intervals are based on <em>s</em>, 
their widths vary from sample to sample. Click on the narrowest intervals and 
observe that they correspond to samples whose values happen to be close together.</li>
<li>Intervals based on <em>s</em> 
now include µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;12 
<strong>much less often than 95% of the time</strong>. (The theory is advanced, 
but the confidence level of the interval is actually 88%, not 95%.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeat with a sample size of 3. When using the sample standard deviation, the 
confidence level is even lower &mdash; 81% instead of 95%.</p>

</div>

<p>The interval estimate clearly needs to be modified in order to have a confidence 
level of 95%, especially for small samples.</p>
