<p class="heading">Distribution of difference between sample means</p>

<p>In the previous section, we saw that the difference between two independent 
quantities <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> has a distribution with mean and standard deviation</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/twoGroupInf/images/meanSDDiff2.gif" width="113" height="51"> </p>
<p>We can apply this to obtain the distribution of the difference between the 
means of two random samples.</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/twoGroupInf/images/diffMeanSD.gif" width="340" height="163"> </p>
<p class="heading">Shape of the distribution</p>

<dl>
<dt>If the distributions are normal in each group,&nbsp;...</dt>
<dd>... the two sample means have normal distributions, and their difference is 
also normally distributed.</dd>
<dt>If the distributions are not normal in the two groups,&nbsp;...</dt>
<dd>... the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('meanVar4')">Central 
Limit Theorem</a> states that the distributions of the two sample means approach 
a normal shape when the sample size increases, so their difference also approaches 
a normal shape.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In general therefore,</p>

<p>The diagram below models an experiment in which a sample of male college students and a sample of experienced female industrial workers were asked to perform a manipulative task involving insertion of pins into a board. The number of pins inserted in one minute was recorded from each subject.</p>
<p>(The means and standard deviations are those obtained from an actual experiment that was <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('twoGroupModel5')">described earlier</a>.)</p>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then take several samples. Observe that the 
empirical distribution of the difference between the means matches the theoretical 
pink normal distribution.</p>
