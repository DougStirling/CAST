<p class="heading">Interest in comparing two groups</p>

<p>We often want to compare individuals (or other units) from two groups. If a numerical
value is recorded from each individual, the resulting data consist of two batches of
numbers &mdash; one from each group.
Differences between the distributions of values in the two groups are often of interest.
</p>

<center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="white">
      <tr>
<th align="CENTER" width="22%"><font color="blue">'Individuals'</font></th>
<th align="CENTER" width="22%"><font color="blue">Measurement</font></th>
<th align="CENTER" width="22%"><font color="blue">Groups</font></th>
<th align="CENTER" width="34%"><font color="blue">Question</font></th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Customers in a supermarket</td>
<td>Amount spent (dollars)</td>
<td>Male and female</td>
<td>Do male and female customers spend the same amounts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bank accounts</td>
<td>Number of transactions in month</td>
<td>Two types of account with different fee structures (one with lower per-transaction 
charge and the other with lower fixed charge)</td>
<td>Are there more transactions in accounts with lower per-transaction charges? 
By how much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'2 litre' milk containers filled in bottling factory</td>
<td>Volume of milk in container</td>
<td>Two different filling machines</td>
<td>Do both machines fill the containers with the same amount of milk on average?</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

  <p class="heading">Questions are often about underlying populations</p>
  
<p>The questions in the above scenarios are not about the <strong>specific</strong> 
customers who entered the supermarket, the <strong>specific</strong> bank accounts 
that were sampled, etc. They ask about the differences between supermarket spending by males and females <strong>in general</strong>, the differences between the two types of bank account
<strong>in general</strong>, etc. </p>

<p>We are therefore usually interested in the characteristics of a population 
or process that we assume <strong>underlies</strong> the data that are collected. 
The data provide information about the likely characteristics of the population. 
</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Examples</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a few data sets in which values are in two groups.</p>

<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeSvgImage(this)">
<option value="0" selected>Asset-to-liabilities ratios of companies</option>
<option value="1">Cola sales and shelf location</option>
<option value="2">Bonuses at end of year</option>
<option value="3">Piecework vs salary</option>
<option value="4">Effect of moderator on groups</option>
</select>
</form>

<p align="center"><iframe src="images/failedCo.svg" id="dataImage" width="523" height="299" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Note that the red questions do not refer to the specific individuals in the 
study, but ask about differences between the groups 'in general' &mdash; we would like 
to use the answers to predict what will happen to other individuals. </p>
