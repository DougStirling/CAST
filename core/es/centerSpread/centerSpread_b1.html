<p class="heading">Summarising centre and spread</p>

  <p>Most data sets exhibit variability &mdash; all values are not the same! Two important 
		aspects of the distribution of values are particularly important.</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Centre</dt>
		<dd>The centre of a distribution is a 'typical' value around which the data 
			are located.</dd>
		<dt>Spread</dt>
		<dd>The spread of a distribution of values describes the distance of the individual 
      values from the centre.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p class=eqn><object data="images/centerSpreadIdea.svg" width="325" height="109"></object>
	</p>
	
	<p>In this section, we examine how to describe centre and spread with numerical 
		values called <strong>summary statistics</strong>. Numerical summaries of 
		centre and spread give particularly concise and meaningful comparisons of 
		different groups.</p>

    <p>A pharmaceutical company is in the final stages of testing a new class 
      of drugs that are effective at reducing high blood pressure. Some patients 
      have however reported side effects &mdash; in particular some felt that their 
      perception of distance had been affected.</p>
    <p>The diagram below shows results from an experiment that was conducted to 
      measure whether the ability to assess distance was worse for patients receiving 
      the drugs. A 'control' group of 20 male patients were not given any drug, 
      whereas two other groups were given drug A and drug B. Each subject was 
      asked to position himself 3 metres from a wall and the actual distance was 
      recorded.</p>
    
<table width="95%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
				<td align="center"><object data="images/differentCentres_b.svg" width="243" height="343"></object></td>
				<td align="left"> 
					<p>There is considerable variation in the estimates of the 3-metre distance 
            from the patients &mdash; their estimates were up to 1 metre in error.</p>
					<ul>
            <li>The centre of the Control group's distribution is close to zero 
              &mdash; patients who got no drug were usually close to the correct length.</li>
            <li>Patients getting Drug A tended to choose a position that was too 
							close to the wall. The centre of Drug A's distribution is about 
							2.5 metres.</li>
            <li>Patients getting Drug B tended to position themselves too far 
							from the wall. The centre of Drug B's distribution is about 3.5 
							metres.</li>
          </ul>
					</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>A numerical measure of centre should describe this tendency to over- 
			or under-estimate the distance.</p>
			
		<hr width="75%">

		<p>After further development, a similar trial was conducted with two different 
      drugs.</p>
		
<table width="95%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
				<td align="center"><object data="images/differentSpreads_b.svg" width="243" height="343"></object></td>
				<td align="left"> 
					<p>There is no tendency to over- or under-estimate a 3 metre distance 
            with these drugs &mdash; the centres of all three distributions are close 
            to zero. However </p>
					<ul>
						<li>With Drug C, there is far more variability &mdash; patients can be 
              in error by as much as 1 metre in their assessment of a 3-metre 
              distance. </li>
						<li>Patients getting Drug D can be wildly inaccurate in their assessment 
              of difference &mdash; they sometimes over- or under-estimate the distance 
              by as much as 2 metres.</li>
					</ul>
					</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>A numerical measure of spread should describe this tendency for greater 
			errors with drugs C and D.</p>
