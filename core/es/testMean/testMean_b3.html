<p class=heading>Model and hypotheses</p>
<p>In both examples in the first page of this section, there was knowledge of the population 
standard deviation σ
(at least when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> was true). This greatly 
simplifies the problem of finding a p-value for the test.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<dl>
<dt>Blood pressure of executives</dt>
<dd>From published information, the national distribution of blood pressure in 
males aged 35-44 is known to have a standard deviation σ 
= 15.</dd>
<dt>Active ingredient in medicine</dt>
<dd>The testing procedure is widely used and the errors are known to have a distribution 
with σ 
= 0.0068 grams per litre.</dd>
</dl>

</div>

<p>In both examples, the hypotheses were of the form,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span></p>

<p class=heading>Summary Statistic</p>

<p>The first step in finding a p-value for the test is to identify a summary statistic 
that throws light on whether <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> or <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> is true. 
When testing the population mean, µ, 
the obvious summary statistic is the sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, 
and the hypothesis tests that will be described here are based on this.</p>
<p>We saw earlier that sample mean has a distribution with mean and standard deviation</p>
<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:6px"><img src="../../images/symbol.muXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=&nbsp; &mu;</span> 
</p>
<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position:relative; top:12px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline"></span> 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('randomMean5')">Central 
Limit Theorem</a> states that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately 
normal, provided the sample size is not small. (The result holds even for small 
samples if the population distribution is also normal.)</p>
<p class=heading>P-value</p>

<p>The p-value for the test is the probability of getting a sample mean as 'extreme' 
as the one that was recorded when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> is true.</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Note that we can assume knowledge of both µ 
and σ 
in this calculation &mdash; the values of both are fixed by <b>H<sub>0</sub></b></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Since we know the distribution of the sample mean (when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> 
is true), the p-value can be evaluated as the tail area of this distribution.</p>

<dl>
<dt>One-tailed test</dt>
<dd>If the alternative hypothesis <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> specifies <strong>large</strong> 
values of µ, 
the p-value is the upper tail area (shown in green below). If <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> 
is for <strong>small</strong> values of µ, 
the opposite tail of the distribution is used.</dd>
</dl>

	</object>
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Two-tailed test</dt>
	<dd>If the alternative hypothesis <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> allows for <strong>large 
		or small</strong> values of µ, 
		the p-value is the sum of the two tail areas below.</dd>

<div class="diagram">
<p class=heading>Pregnancy duration</p>
	
<p>The duration of a woman's pregnancy is quite variable. For women who receive 
adequate medical attention, records show that the duration is a random variable 
with mean µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;266 
days and standard deviation σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;16 
days. The distribution is also approximately normal.</p>
<p>It is known that women who receive inadequate prenatal care often have shorter 
pregnancies with resultant health problems. The diagram below shows the pregnancy 
durations of 70 women from an urban hospital in Nashville, Tennessee where many 
of the women are from lower socio-economic groups. Their mean pregnancy duration 
was found to be 260.3 days.</p>

<p>If the null hypothesis was true, the sample mean would have the normal distribution 
shown in pale blue. The sample mean duration is unusually low for this distribution, 
so we conclude that there is strong evidence that the mean duration is lower than 
266 days.</p>
<p>The right of the diagram shows how the p-value is calculated. A z-score is 
obtained by standardising the sample mean, then this is used to find the probability 
from a standard normal distribution.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>Choose <strong>Modified Data</strong> from the pop-up menu. The slider allows 
you to investigate how low the sample mean must become in order to give evidence 
that µ 
is less than 266 days.</p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Test Statistic</p>

<p>In the example above, we found the p-value by standardising <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">. 
The intermediate z-value is called a <strong>test statistic</strong> and has a 
'standard' distribution from which the p-value can be found.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the stages in obtaining the p-value for a two-tailed 
test. </p>
