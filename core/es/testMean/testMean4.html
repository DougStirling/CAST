<p class="heading">Unknown standard deviation</p>
<p>In the examples on the previous page, the population standard deviation, σ, 
was a known value. Unfortunately this is rarely the case in practice, so the previous 
test cannot be used.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Saturated fat content of cooking oil</p>

<p>Both cholesterol and saturated fats are often avoided by people who are trying 
to lose weight or reduce their blood cholesterol level. Cooking oil made from 
soybeans has little cholesterol and has been claimed to have only 15% saturated 
fat.</p>
<p>A clinician believes that the saturated fat content is greater than 15% and 
randomly samples 13 bottles of soybean cooking oil for testing.</p>

<p>However we no longer know the population standard deviation, σ. 
The only information we have about σ 
comes from our sample.</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">Test statistic and its distribution</p>

<p>When the population standard deviation, σ, 
was a known value, we used a test statistic </p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/testMean/images/zStatDefn.gif" width="92" height="47"></p>

<p>which has a standard normal distribution when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> was true.</p>
<p>When σ 
is unknown, we use a closely related test statistic,</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/testMean/images/tStatDefn.gif" width="90" height="46"></p>

<p>where <i>s</i> is the <strong>sample</strong> standard deviation. This test 
statistic has greater spread than the standard normal distribution, due to the 
extra variability that results from estimating <i>s</i>, especially when the sample 
size <i>n</i> is small.</p>


<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram below generates random samples from a normal distribution. Click 
<strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to see the variability in the samples.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then take about 50 random samples. Observe 
that the stacked dot plot of the t statistic conforms reasonably with a standard 
normal distribution.</p>
<p>Now use the pop-up menu to reduce the sample size to 5 and take a further 50-100 
samples. You will probably notice that there are more 'extreme' t-values (less 
than -3 or more than +3) than would be expected from a standard normal distribution.</p>
<p>Reduce the sample size to 3 and repeat. It should now be clearer that the distribution 
of the t-statistic has greater spread than a standard normal distribution. Click 
on the crosses for the most extreme t-values and observe that they correspond 
to samples in which the 3 data values happen to be close together, resulting in 
a small sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>.</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">The t distribution</p>
<p>We have seen that the <em>t</em> statistic does not have a standard normal 
distribution, but it does have another standard distribution called a <strong>t 
distribution with (<i>n</i> - 1) degrees of freedom</strong>. In the next page, 
we will use this distribution to obtain the p-value for hypothesis tests.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram below shows the shape of the t distribution for various different values
of the degrees of freedom.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="300" height="300">

</div>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider to see how the shape of the t distribution depends
on the degrees of freedom. Note that
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The t distribution's shape becomes close to the standard normal distribution
  (the red curve) as the degrees of freedom increase.
      <br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>When the degrees of freedom are small, the t distribution has much longer tails than the
  standard normal distribution.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li>When the degrees of freedom are around 10, the <strong>centre</strong> of the t distribution looks close to a standard normal distribution. However an important use of the t distribution is in hypothesis tests where the tails of the distribution are particularly important. The <strong>tails</strong> of the distributions are quite different.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>A standard normal distribution can be used as an approximation to a t distribution if the degrees of freedom are large (say 30 or more) but the t distribution must be used for smaller degrees of freedom.</p>
