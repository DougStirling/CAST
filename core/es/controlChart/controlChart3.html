<p class="heading">Control limits</p>

<p>The simplest rule suggesting a special cause is any value that is outside
two <strong>control limits</strong>. The values 2000&nbsp;ml and 2080&nbsp;ml
on the run chart in the previous page might be used as control limits. More extreme
values in the process suggest that it is <strong>out of control</strong> --
they <strong>trigger</strong> an examination of the process for a special cause.
</p>

<p>Since control limits on a run chart are used to trigger an examination of the 
  production process &mdash; possibly a costly exercise &mdash; we must set them wide enough 
  that they are rarely exceeded when the process is stable. </p>

<p class="heading">Control limits from the 70-95-100 rule</p>
<p>We usually base the control limits on the mean and standard deviation of the 
  process when it is in control. The 70-95-100 rule of thumb states that in many 
  distributions, </p>

<ul>
  <li>Approximately two thirds of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
  <li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
  <li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rule is illustrated in the diagram below.
</p>

<p class=eqn><object data="images/bands.svg" width="578" height="264"></object>
</p>

<p>By setting the upper and lower control limits to be 3 standard deviations
on either side of the process mean, we avoid many 'false alarms' when the process is
in control.
</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
  <p>The normal distribution below shows the variability of a process with mean 
    52 and standard deviation 0.5.</p>
  <div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="450" height="250">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="controlProg.DragNormalApplet">
<param name="varName" value="value">
<param name="normParams" value="52 0.5">
<param name="gammaParams" value="3 0.28867 51.1340">
<param name="horizAxis" value="50 54 50 1">
<param name="customText" value="Symmetric distribution=Symmetric distribution#Skew distribution=Skew distribution#Show mean and st devn=Show mean and st devn">
</applet>
</div>

  <p>Click anywhere on the distribution to display the proportion of values within 
    this distance of the process mean. </p>

<p>Click the checkbox <strong>Show Mean and St Devn</strong> to replace the
horizontal axis with a scale showing distances from the mean as multiples of the standard
deviation. Verify the 70-95-100 rule for this distribution.
</p>

  <p>The 70-95-100 rule is a less reliable guideline for non-normal distributions. 
    Select the option <strong>Skew distribution</strong> from the pop-up menu 
    beneath the diagram and repeat the exercise. </p>

</div>

<p>Although the actual proportion of values outside the <i>mean ± 3 st 
  devn</i> control limits depends on the shape of the distribution, it is a rare 
  occurrence for all distributions when the process is under control. However:</p>
<center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
    <tr> 
      <th align="CENTER">Control limits at ±&nbsp;3 standard deviations 
        from the process mean should be avoided for very skew distributions.</th>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>

<p>If the measurements are very skew, consider transforming the data before producing 
  a run chart.</p>
