<p class=heading>Inference and random samples</p>

<p>The examples in the previous section involved a range of different types of 
model for the observed data. In the remainder of this chapter, we concentrate 
on one particular type of model &mdash; random sampling from a population.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We assume now that the observed data are a <strong>random 
sample from some population</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When the observed data are a random sample, inference asks questions about 
characteristics of the underlying population distribution &mdash; unknown population 
parameters.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>For random samples, the null and alternative hypotheses specify values 
for the unknown population parameters.</p>
</div></div>

<p class=heading>Inference about categorical populations</p>
<p>When the population distribution is categorical, the unknowns are the population 
probabilities for the different categories. To simplify, we consider populations 
for which one category is of particular interest ('success') and we denote the 
unknown probability of success by π.</p>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses are therefore specified in terms of π.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Australia Post example</p>

<p>A journalist trying to assess Australia Post's assertion that 96 percent of 
letters arrive 'on time' posted 59 letters and observed that only 52 arrived on 
time.</p>

<p>We model delivery of these letters as a random sample of 59 categorical values 
from a population with probability π 
of success (arrival on time). The null hypothesis of interest is therefore...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.96</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.96</p>
<p class=heading>Design of CD case</p>
<p>A company intends to manufacture a case that will hold 20 CDs. The design team 
	are particularly keen on a design that is more expensive to manufacture than two 
	competing designs. The manager wants to be sure that customers will prefer the 
	more expensive case before starting production &mdash; the price is determined by competitors' 
	CD cases so the more expensive one will have a reduced profit margin and can only 
	be justified if sales are considerably higher.</p>
<p>To assess whether customers prefer the more expensive case, a limited number 
	of each of the three designs is manufactured and placed for sale at the same price 
	in a CD store. Out of the first 90 cases sold, the more expensive case was bought 
	36 times.</p>
<p>This situation can be modelled as random sampling of 90 values (the three case 
	designs) from a categorical population in which the probability of picking the 
	expensive case is π. 
	The null hypothesis of interest is therefore...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(no 
	preference)</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(preference 
	for the expensive case)</p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Tests about parameters of other populations</p>

<p>Other data sets arise as random samples from different kinds of population. 
For example, numerical data sets are often modelled as random samples from a normal 
distribution. Again, the hypotheses of interest are usually expressed in terms 
of the parameters of this distribution.</p>
<p>For example, to test whether the mean of a normal distribution is zero, the 
hypotheses would be...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; µ&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section, we show how to test a population probability, 
and in the next section we will describe tests about a population mean.</p>
