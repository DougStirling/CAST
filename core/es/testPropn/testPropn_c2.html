<p class=heading>Test statistic</p>
<p>When testing the value of a probability, π, 
  the obvious statistic to use from our random sample is the corresponding sample 
  proportion, <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>It is however more convenient to use the <strong>number</strong> of successes, <em>x</em>, rather than <em>p</em> since we know that <em>X</em> has a <strong>binomial distribution</strong> with 
  parameters <em>n</em> (the sample size) and π.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed percent50">
<p><em>X</em>&nbsp; ~ &nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">binomial</font> (<em>n</em>&nbsp;, &pi;)</p>
</div></div>

<p>When we know the distribution of the test statistic (at least after the null 
  hypothesis has fixed the value of the parameters of interest), it becomes much 
  easier to obtain the p-value for the test.</p>
<p class=heading>P-value</p>
<p>As in all other tests, the p-value is the probability of getting such an 'extreme' 
  set of data if the null hypothesis is true. Depending on the null and alternative 
  hypotheses, the p-value is therefore the probability that <em>X </em>is as big 
  (or sometimes as small) as the recorded value.</p>
<p>Since we know the binomial distribution of <em>X</em> when the null hypothesis 
  holds, the p-value can therefore be obtained by adding binomial probabilities.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The p-value is a sum of binomial probabilities</p>
</div></div>

<p>Note that the p-value can be obtained exactly <strong>without need for simulations 
  or randomisation</strong>.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Australia Post example</p>

<p>A journalist trying to assess Australia Post's assertion that 96 percent of 
letters arrive 'on time' posted 59 letters and observed that only 52 arrived on 
time.</p>

<p class="eqn"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.96</p>
<p class="eqn"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.96</p>

<p>In the diagram below, click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then hold down <strong>Simulate</strong> 
until about 100 samples of 59 letters have been generated. The proportion of these 
simulated samples in which 52 or fewer letters arrived on time is an approximation 
to the p-value for the test.</p>

</div>

<p>Since we know that the number arriving on time has a binomial&nbsp;(52, 0.96) 
distribution when the null hypothesis holds, <span class="darkred">the simulation 
is unnecessary</span>. Select<strong> Binomial distribution</strong> from the 
pop-up menu. This binomial distribution is displayed, and the probability of 52 
or fewer letters being delivered on time is shown to be 0.009 &mdash; the p-value for 
the test.</p>
<p>Since the p-value is so small, there would have been very little chance of 
the observed data arising if Australia Post's assertion had been correct. We can 
therefore conclude that there is strong evidence against their assertion. Note 
that this can be done <strong>without any simulations</strong>.</p>
