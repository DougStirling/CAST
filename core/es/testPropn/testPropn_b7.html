<p class="heading">Test statistic and p-value</p>
<p>The <strong>statistical distance</strong> of an estimate to a hypothesised
value of the underlying parameter is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../en/testMean/images/zGeneral.gif" width="185" height="37"></p>
<p>This can be used at test statistic. If the null hypothesis holds, it approximately
has a standard normal distribution &mdash; a normal distribution with zero mean and
unit standard deviation.</p>
<p>The p-value for a test can be determined from the tail areas of this standard
normal distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../en/testMean/images/pValueFromZ.gif" width="471" height="212"></p>
<p>In the above diagram, the null hypothesis is consistent with with estimates
close to the hypothesised value and the alternative hypothesis is suggested by
estimates that are either much bigger or smaller than this value (called a two-tailed
test). For a two-tailed test, the p-value is the red tail area and can be looked
up using either normal tables or in Excel.</p>
<p class="heading">Refinements</p>
<p>If the standard error of the estimate must itself be estimated from the sample
data, the above test statistic is only approximately normally distributed. In
some tests that we will describe in later sections, the test statistic has a
t distribution (which has slightly longer tails than the standard normal distribution).
This refinement will be described fully in the next section.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>Adverse reactions to drug</p>

<p>The diagram below repeats the simulation that we used earlier to test whether
the proportion of patients getting a certain drug who had adverse reactions is
more than 1%:</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 128</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 128</strong></span></p>
<p>The  proportion with adverse reactions in a sample of <em>n</em> = 2,500 patients
was <sup>37</sup>/<sub>2500</sub> = 0.0148.</p>
<p>Again click <strong>Accumulate</strong> and hold down the <strong>Simulate</strong> button
until about 100 samples of 2,500 patients have been generated with a population
probability of adverse reactions equal to 0.01.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Statistical distance from 0.01</strong> from the top pop-up
menu to translate the  proportions with adverse reactions in the simulated samples
into z-scores. Observe that most of these 'statistical distances from 0.5' are
between -1 and +1.</p>
<p>The observed proportion with adverse reactions was 0.0148, corresponding to
a statistical distance of <em>z</em> = 2.41, a fairly unlikely value if the population
proportion was 0.01.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Normal distribution</strong> from the lower pop-up menu to
show the theoretical distribution of the z-scores. The p-value for the test is
the tail area of this normal(0, 1) distribution above 2.41 and is 0.0079, so
we again conclude that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>It is very strong evidence that π is <strong>more than</strong> 0.01.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Relation to previous test</p>
<p>The p-value obtained in this way using a 'statistical distance' as the test
statistic is <strong>identical</strong> to the p-value that was found from a
normal approximation to the number of successes <strong>without</strong> a continuity
correction. (The p-value is slightly different if a continuity correction is
used.)</p>
<p>The use of 'statistical distances' does not add anything when testing a sample
proportion, but it is a general method that will be used to obtain test statistics
in many other situations later in this e-book.</p>
