<p class=heading>Inference and random samples</p>

<p>The examples in the previous section involved a range of different types of 
model for the observed data. In the remainder of this chapter, we concentrate 
on one particular type of model &mdash; random sampling from a population.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We assume now that the observed data are a <strong>random 
sample from some population</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When the observed data are a random sample, inference asks questions about 
characteristics of the underlying population distribution &mdash; unknown population 
parameters.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>For random samples, the null and alternative hypotheses specify values 
for the unknown population parameters.</p>
</div></div>

<p class=heading>Inference about categorical populations</p>
<p>When the population distribution is categorical, the unknowns are the population 
probabilities for the different categories. To simplify, we consider populations 
for which one category is of particular interest ('success') and we denote the 
unknown probability of success by π.</p>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses are therefore specified in terms of π.</p>

<p class=heading>Weapon detection at LAX</p>

<p>FAA agents tried to carry 100 weapons onto planes at LA International Airport. 
Of these, 72 were detected by security guards, and we are interested in whether 
this is consistent with the national probability of detection, 0.80.</p>

<p>We model detection of weapons as a random sample of 100 categorical values 
from a population with probability π 
of success (detection). The null hypothesis of interest is therefore...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.80</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.80</p>
<p class=heading>Telepathy experiment</p>
<p>An experiment is conducted to investigate whether one subject can telepathically 
	pass shape information to another subject. A deck of cards containing equal numbers 
	of cards with circles, squares and crosses is shuffled. One subject selects cards 
	at random and attempts to 'send' the shape on the card to the other subject who 
	is seated behind a screen; this second subject reports the shape imagined for 
	the card. From 90 cards, the second subject correctly identifies 36.</p>
<p>This situation can be modelled as random sampling of 90 values (correct or 
	wrong) from a categorical population in which the probability of correctly identifying 
	the card is π. 
	The null hypothesis of interest is therefore...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(guessing)</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(telepathy)</p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Tests about parameters of other populations</p>

<p>Other data sets arise as random samples from different kinds of population. 
For example, numerical data sets are often modelled as random samples from a normal 
distribution. Again, the hypotheses of interest are usually expressed in terms 
of the parameters of this distribution.</p>
<p>For example, to test whether the mean of a normal distribution is zero, the 
hypotheses would be...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; µ ≠&nbsp;0</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section, we show how to test a population probability, 
and in the next section we will describe tests about a population mean.</p>
