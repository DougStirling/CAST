	<description>Match the spreads of four normal pdfs to means or sums with different n (normal)</description>
	<comment>This question presents four normal pdfs with different spreads and gives a list of four sample sizes. It asks to match the distributions with the sample sizes (by dragging) for either the sample mean or sample total.\\nIt assesses knowledge of how the sample size affects the spread of the mean or total.</comment>
