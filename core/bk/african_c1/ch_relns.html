  <p>When only a single measurement is made from each individual (or unit) in 
		a group, we cannot associate variation in that measurement with other characteristics 
		of the individuals. </p>
	<p>When two or more measurements are made from each individual, we may be be 
		able to associate variation in one measurement with changes in the other measurements. 
		If two measurements are made from each individual, the data are called <strong>bivariate</strong>. 
		Examples are ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rainfall and temperature in a town</li>
		<li>Blood pressure and weight of males in their 50s</li>
		<li>Fertiliser application and yield of wheat in fields</li>
		<li>Carbohydrate content and moisture content of corn</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Our aim with such data is to find information about the <strong>relationship</strong> 
		between the variables.</p>
