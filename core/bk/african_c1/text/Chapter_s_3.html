<h1 class="chapterName">Chapter 3 &nbsp; Graphical Summaries</h1>
<h1 class="sectionName">3.1 &nbsp; Histograms and density</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">3.1.1 &nbsp; Density of values</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Density</p>
	<p>In a stacked dot plot (or stem and leaf plot), the highest stacks contain the most values. These stacks have the highest <strong>density</strong> of values.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_dotPlotCanopy.gif" name="dataImage" width="445" height="220"></p>
<p>Histograms more directly show how density varies along the axis.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.2 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Histograms</p>
<p>In a simple histogram, the axis is split into sub-intervals of equal width called <strong>classes</strong>. A rectangle is drawn above each class with height equal to the number of values  in the class &mdash; the <strong>frequency</strong> of the class.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_histo.gif" width="502" height="349"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.3 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h2>

<p class="heading">Aim of a 'smooth' histogram</p>
	<p>There is considerable freedom in the choice of histogram classes. The exact
shape depends on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Class width</li>
		<li>Start value for first class</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We usually choose classes with the aim of <strong>smoothness</strong> in the outline 
		of the histogram rectangles.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_classWidths.gif" width="368" height="360"></p>
	<p>The choice of 'best' classes is subjective, but...</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If your conclusions about what a histogram tells you about the data  depend on the choice of histogram classes, you are over-interpreting its shape.</p>
	</div></div>

	


<h2 class="pageName">3.1.4 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h2>

<p class="heading">Warning for small data sets</p>
	<p>For small data sets, changing the class width and the starting position for
the first class can give a <strong>surprising amount of variability in histogram
shape</strong>, so be extremely wary of over-interpreting features  such as
clusters or skewness.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is probably better to avoid using histograms unless there is a reasonable number of values &mdash; stacked dot plots are far less likely to mislead you over minor features.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.5 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h2>

<p class="heading">Relative frequency</p>
	<p>When all histogram classes are of equal width, histograms are often drawn 
		with a vertical axis giving the frequencies (counts) for each class. The vertical axis can alternatively be labelled with the <strong>relative frequencies</strong> (proportions) for the classes.</p>
	<p>(There is no harm in including both axes.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_relFreqHisto.gif" width="420" height="236"></p>
	<p class="heading">Area equals relative frequency</p>
	<p>An important property of histograms is that the proportion of values in one or more classes equals the proportion of the histogram area above these classes.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_area.gif" width="455" height="289"> </p>
	<p>Therefore,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Relative frequency = proportion of the total 
			area</p>
	</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.6 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Relative frequencies to compare two groups</p>
	<p>Histograms may be superimposed to compare two groups. However if the groups
differ in size,  it is usually more meaningful to compare relative frequencies
(proportions) than the counts in the classes.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Use <strong>relative frequency</strong> histograms to compare groups.</p>
</div></div>
	<p>For example,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_histoGroups.gif" width="456" height="461"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.7 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Mixed class widths</p>
<p>For some data sets, wider classes give a smoother histogram in some ranges of values (e.g. in the tail of a distribution) and narrower classes are better in other parts of the distribution (usually where there is greater density of values).</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p> In a correctly drawn histogram, each value contributes the same area. </p>
</div></div>
<p>Histograms can be drawn with mixed class widths, but it would be <strong>badly misleading</strong> to make the rectangle heights equal to either the class frequency or relative frequency.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_mixedClasses.gif" width="504" height="431"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.8 &nbsp; Understanding histograms</h2>

<p class="heading">Area and proportion of values</p>
<p>The details of drawing histograms by hand with varying class widths are unimportant
&mdash; a computer should be used. To interpret
their shape remember that</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>The proportion of the total area above any classes
equals the proportion of values in them.</p></div></div>
<p>For example,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_mixedProbs.gif" width="456" height="292"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.1.9 &nbsp; Frequency polygons</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Frequency polygons</p>
<p>A <strong>frequency polygon</strong> is closely related to a histogram with equal class widths. It joins the midpoints of the tops of the class rectangles and tends to give a smoother outline than the corresponding histogram.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_freqPoly.gif" width="448" height="237"></p>
<p>It is easier to distinguish and compare superimposed frequency polygons for two groups than the corresponding histograms.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_freqPoly2.gif" width="449" height="206"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.1.10 &nbsp; Kernel density estimates ((optional))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Kernel density estimates</p>
<p>A <strong>kernel density estimate</strong> is an alternative to a histogram that often results in a smoother display of the density of values. Each data value on the axis is replaced by a 'blob' of ink (kernel) and these kernels are stacked.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_kernel.gif" width="349" height="263"></p>
<p>The widths of the kernels can be adjusted &mdash; if they are too narrow, the display becomes jagged, but if they are too wide, the display becomes too spread out and detail is lost.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.1.11 &nbsp; Drawing histograms by hand ((optional))</h2>

<p class="heading">Frequency table</p>
<p>A computer is normally used to draw histograms. Hand-drawn histograms are
based on a <strong>frequency table</strong> that lists the histogram classes
and their frequencies.</p>
<p>To avoid ambiguity in the histogram, the class boundaries should be chosen to ensure that no data values are on boundaries. For example,</p>
<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/freqTable2.gif" width="280" height="150"></div>
<p class=heading>Height of a histogram rectangle</p>
<p>To draw a histogram by hand with equal class widths, each class rectangle
can be drawn with height equal to its class frequency. If class widths vary,
we need to calculate the <strong>density</strong> for each class with the formula:</p>
<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/densityDefn.gif" width="284" height="39"> </p>
<p>and use this for the rectangle heights.</p>





<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">3.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles & box plots</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">3.2.1 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h2>

<p class="heading">Unhelpful detail when comparing groups</p>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain a lot of detail about
the distribution of values in a data set. This level of detail is useful when
examining a single data set, but when several groups of values are being compared,
the detail distracts from the main differences between the groups.</p>
<p>For example, the jittered dot plots below do not concisely summarise the differences
between the five groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_jitteredGroups.gif" width="413" height="224"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.2.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h2>

<p class="heading">Five-number summary</p>
<p>Five values are enough to capture a lot of information about the distribution of values in a data set.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The two <strong>extremes</strong>  (i.e. the minimum and maximum values).</li>
	<li>The <strong>lower quartile</strong>, <strong>median</strong> and <strong>upper quartile</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These values split the data set into four groups with approximately equal numbers of values.</p>
<p class="heading">Box plot</p>
<p>A box plot displays the five-number summary graphically.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_boxPlotDefn.gif" width="445" height="225"></p>
<p class="heading">Details</p>
<p>The median, <em>m</em>, is the middle value if there is an odd number of values in the data set. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two.</p>
<p>Different authors give slightly different definitions for the upper and lower
quartiles. One definition of the lower quartile is the median of the lowest half
of the data &mdash; i.e. of the values lower than <em>m</em>. (The upper quartile
would then be defined as the median of the top half of the values.)</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Provided you are consistent, different definitions of the quartiles  should lead you to the same conclusions.</p>
</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">3.2.3 &nbsp; Interpreting a box plot's shape</h2>

<p class="heading">Box plots and histograms</p>
	<p>Since the median and quartiles split the data set into quartiles, they also  split a histogram of the data into four approximately equal areas.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/histoQuantiles.gif" id="gif_image_1" width="341" height="264"></p>
<p class=heading>What does a box plot tell you about the distribution?</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Centre</dt>
		<dd>The median gives an indication of the 
			<strong>centre</strong> of the distribution.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_centre.gif" width="443" height="118"></p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Spread</dt>
		<dd>The width of the box (the <strong>interquartile range</strong>) and the
difference between the maximum and minimum (<strong>range</strong>) both give
an indication of the 
			<strong>spread</strong> of values.</dd>
</dl>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_spread.gif" width="443" height="118"></p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Skewness</dt>
		<dd>The distances of the minimum and lower quartile to the median, in relation
to the corresponding distances of the maximum and upper quartile give information
about the <strong>skewness</strong> of the distribution. If the maximum and upper
quartile are further from the median, the distribution is skew with a long tail
of higher values.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_skewness.gif" width="443" height="118"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.2.4 &nbsp; Displaying outliers</h2>

<p class="heading">Outliers and skew distributions</p>
<p>Basic box plots cannot show whether the minimum and maximum in a distribution are outliers or simply the end of skew distributions.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_outlierSkew.gif" width="453" height="236"> </p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.2.5 &nbsp; Clusters</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Box plots and clusters</p>
<p>Box plots cannot show clusters in data.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_clusters.gif" width="448" height="221"></p>
<p>Before using a box plot, always look at the data with a dot plot or histogram
to make sure that there are no clusters.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.2.6 &nbsp; Comparison of groups</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Box plots to compare groups</p>
	<p>To display the distribution of values in a single set of data, a dot plot
or histogram is more useful than a box plot. However for comparison of <strong>two
or more groups</strong> of values box plots are particularly effective &mdash; they
highlight differences between the centres, spreads of values and skewness of
the groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_boxGroups.gif" width="413" height="224"></p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">3.3 &nbsp; Discrete data (counts)</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">3.3.1 &nbsp; Discrete and continuous data</h2>

<p>It is important to distinguish  two types of numerical data. </p>
<dl>
	<dt>Discrete data</dt>
	<dd>When the values in the batch are whole numbers (<strong>counts</strong>), 
		the data set is called <strong>discrete</strong>.		</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Continuous data</dt>
	<dd>When the data are not constrained to be whole numbers, the data set is 
		called <strong>continuous</strong>.		</dd>
</dl>
<p class=heading>Dot plots for counts</p>
<p>Dot plots can be used to display count data. However since discrete values
are often repeated several times in a data set, the crosses need to be jittered
or, preferably, stacked.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/counts/images/s_stackedDots.gif" width="499" height="102"></p>
<p>If there is a stack for each integer value, the stacked dot plot is a complete representation of the data.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.3.2 &nbsp; Histograms for counts</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Displaying moderate or large counts</p>
	<p>For discrete data sets whose values are large counts, a histogram can be
used to give a 'smooth' summary of the shape of the distribution of values.</p>
	<p>If the counts are a bit smaller, the exact definition of the histogram classes becomes important. The class boundaries should end in '.5' to ensure that data values 
		do not occur on the boundary of two classes.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/counts/images/s_histo.gif" width="503" height="309"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.3.3 &nbsp; Bar charts</h2>

<p class="heading">Displaying small counts</p>
	<p>When the range of values in a discrete data set is small, a histogram can be drawn with class width 1 (and with class boundaries ending in '.5'). These classes are <strong>centred 
		</strong>on  1, 2, 3, etc. </p>
	<p>This can be improved by narrowing the histogram rectangles into bars to emphasise
the discrete nature of the data. This is called a <strong> bar chart</strong>.
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/counts/images/s_barchart.gif" width="451" height="189"></p>
