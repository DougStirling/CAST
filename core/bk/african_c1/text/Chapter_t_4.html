<h1>Chapter 4 &nbsp; Numerical Summaries</h1>
<h2>4.1 &nbsp; Describing centre</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 &nbsp; Centre and spread</h3>
<p>The centre of a distribution is a 'typical value'. The spread describes how far the values are from the centre.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 &nbsp; Median, range and IQR</h3>
<p>The median is a summary of the centre of a distribution. The range and inter-quartile range both describe spread.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 &nbsp; Summaries of centre</h3>
<p>The median and mean are alternative measures of the centre of a distribution.</p>
<h3>4.1.4 &nbsp; Properties of median and mean</h3>
<p>When a data set is not symmetric, the mean and median may differ substantially.</p>
<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Describing spread</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h3>
<p>The standard deviation is the most commonly used numerical summary of the spread of values in a data set.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb is useful for understanding the numerical value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; Understanding means and st devns</h3>
<p>It is possible to roughly guess the mean and standard deviation from a histogram and roughly sketch a symmetric histogram matching any given mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>4.2.4 &nbsp; Warnings about mean &amp; st devn</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation cannot give any indication of the existance of outliers, skewness or clusters. A dot plot or histogram should be examined before reporting these numerical summaries.</p>
<h3>4.2.5 &nbsp; Effect of outliers</h3>
<p>If a data set contains an outlier, the mean and especially the standard deviation can be badly affected. The values may be obviously wrong when the 70-95-100 rule is applied in the context of the data but examining a dot plot or box plot is best.</p>
<h3>4.2.6 &nbsp; Mean & sd for discrete data (opt) (Optional)</h3>
<p>For discrete data, the mean and standard deviation can be easily evaluated from a frequency table.</p>
<h2>4.3 &nbsp; Variation and groups</h2>
<h3>4.3.1 &nbsp; Standard deviation of grouped data</h3>
<p>In data sets that consist of different groups, the overall standard deviation is often much higher than the standard deviations within groups.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 &nbsp; Explained and unexplained variation</h3>
<p>Overall variation is partly explained by differences between groups, but some variation (within groups) remains unexplained. Because some variation is explained by the groups (and unexplained variation is reduced), the grouping allows you to predict a new value more accurately.</p>
<h3>4.3.3 &nbsp; Variation between and within groups</h3>
<p>The relative size of within- and between-group variation indicates whether the groups really differ.</p>
<h3>4.3.4 &nbsp; Sums of squares</h3>
<p>Variability within groups and between groups are described by sums of squares.</p>
<h3>4.3.5 &nbsp; Coefficient of determination</h3>
<p>The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is the ratio of the between-groups and total sums of squares. It is the proportion of variation that can be explained by differences between the groups.</p>
<h3>4.3.6 &nbsp; Analysis of variance</h3>
<p>The mean total and within-group sums of squares are closely related to the overall standard deviation and the standard deviations within the groups. They are often arranged in an analysis of variance table.</p>
<h2>4.4 &nbsp; More about variation (optional)</h2>
<h3>4.4.1 &nbsp; Variance and degrees of freedom (Advanced)</h3>
<p>The square of the standard deviation is called the variance; its value is harder to understand but it is the basis of important advanced statistical methods. The degrees of freedom are the number of pieces of information contributing to the standard deviation (or variance).</p>
<h3>4.4.2 &nbsp; Root mean squared error (Advanced)</h3>
<p>The root mean squared error summarises how close the values in a data set are to a target, k.</p>
<h3>4.4.3 &nbsp; Distances from the mean (Advanced)</h3>
<p>The standard deviation is similar to the root mean squared error, but summarises distances to the mean of the data. Its value can be interpreted in terms of the average area of squares on a graph.</p>
