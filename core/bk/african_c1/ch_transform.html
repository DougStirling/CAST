  <p>The statistical methods that were described in earlier chapters are most 
		useful when the variables have fairly 'regular' distributions. If the distributions 
		are very skew, it can be useful to examine a transformed variable rather than 
		the raw data.</p>
	<p>This is even more important when examining the relationship between two variables. 
		The correlation coefficient and least squares should only be used for linear 
		relationships. When the original variables are nonlinearly related, it is 
		often possible to linearise the relationship with a transformation of one 
		or other of the original variables.</p>
