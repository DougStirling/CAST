<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile1" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile1">A data set containing annual rainfalls in Samaru, Nigeria, will be used for illustrative purposes.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile2" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile2">Half the data are lower than the median. A quarter and three quarters are lower than the lower and upper quartiles. At any other value, x, the proportion of data values that are x or lower is called its cumulative proportion.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile3" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile3">A graph of the cumulative proportion below x against x is a step function that increases from zero (at small x) to one (at high x).</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile_m9">Any cumulative proportion, p, can be equivalently expressed as a rate per n values, np, or as a percentage, 100p. If the proportion of values that are x or lower is p, the average number of values until one such value is obtained is 1/p; this is called the 'return period' for values less than or equal to x.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile_m10">This page shows how cumulative proportions are used and interpreted for a few different data sets.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="e_percentile_m4">Some exercises give practice at finding different ways to express proportions, based on real data sets.</page>
