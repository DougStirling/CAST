<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Relationships between Variables</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Bivariate data sets</h3>
<p>Many data sets contain two or more measurements from each individual. Even when the main interest is in one variable, the others can help to understand its distribution.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h3>
<p>The main display that shows the relationship between two variables is a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h3>
<p>Univariate displays don't show relationships between variables.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>A scatterplot of two variables can be enhanced with box plots or histograms on the margins of a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; Time series</h3>
<p>When a single measurement is made at regular intervals, the data are called a time series. Time series data can be treated as bivariate, with time being the second variable.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Understanding relationships</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Strength of a relationship</h3>
<p>The main feature of interest in a scatterplot is the strength of the relationship between the two variables.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>An extreme value of one or both of the variables is an outlier. An unusual combination of values is also called an outlier.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>If the crosses on a scatterplot separate into clusters, different groups of individuals are suggested.</p>
<h3>6.2.4 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h3>
<p>In small data sets, there may be considerable variability, so patterns should be strongly evident before they are reported.</p>
<h3>6.2.5 &nbsp; Explanatory and response variables</h3>
<p>One variable can often be classified as an explanatory variable that either causally affects the reponse variable, or is useful for predicting its value.</p>
