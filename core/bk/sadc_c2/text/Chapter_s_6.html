<h2 class="pageName">6.1.1 &nbsp; Bivariate data sets</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">The data matrix</p>
	<p>Many datasets contain several measurements from each <strong>individual</strong> (or plant, item
		or other unit). Each measurement type is called a <strong>variable</strong>. </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/structures/images/dataMatrix.gif" id="gif_image_1_1_1" width="258" height="283"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/structures/images/dataMatrix.svg" id="svg_image_1_1_1" width="258" height="283" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_1_1_1");</script> </p>
	<p>A data set with more than one variable is called <strong>multivariate</strong>.
One with two
variables is called <strong>bivariate</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">6.1.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Scatterplots</p>
	<p>A scatterplot shows each individual as a single cross against a vertical axis
		(for the variable, <i>Y</i>) and a horizontal axis (for the other variable, <i>X</i>). </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/scatterValues.gif" id="gif_image_1_2_1" width="279" height="189"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/scatterValues.svg" id="svg_image_1_2_1" width="279" height="189" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_1_2_1");</script> </p>
	<p>By convention,  the variable on the vertical axis is called <i>Y</i> and
		the variable on the horizontal axis is called <i>X</i>. </p>





<h2 class="pageName">6.1.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Scatterplots are needed to display  relationships</p>
	<p>The relationship between two variables cannot be determined from examination
 of the two variables in isolation. The two datasets shown in the scatterplots
below have the <strong>same marginal distributions</strong> for X and Y, but the variables are related
in very different ways.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/s_sameMargins.gif" width="509" height="211"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">6.1.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Marginal distributions</p>
<p><span class="full_text">Although 
		they do not contain information about the relationship between the variables, 
	a display of the marginal distributions can be usefully <strong>added</strong> to a scatterplot to enhance it, perhaps highlighting skewness in X and Y.</span></p>

<h2 class="pageName">6.1.5 &nbsp; Time series</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Time-ordering of univariate data</p>
	<p>Some data sets are apparently univariate, but the measurements are made sequentially 
		in time.  A data set of this form is called a <strong>time series</strong>.</p>
	<p>The time at which each measurement was made may be treated as an additional 
		numerical variable, and the measurement can then be plotted against time. 
		This type of scatterplot is often called a <strong>time series plot</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">6.2.1 &nbsp; Strength of a relationship</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Strength of relationship</p>
<p>The most important information that a scatterplot shows is the <strong>strength</strong> of the relationship between the variables. The closer the points to a straight line or curve, the stronger the relationship.</p>
<p>If higher values of one variable tend to be associated with higher values
 of the other variable, the crosses on the scatterplot will be in a band with
positive slope and the relationship is said to be <strong>positive</strong>. If high values of one variable tend to be associated with low values of the 
	other variable, we say that there is a <strong>negative</strong> relationship.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/relationship/images/s_types.gif" width="398" height="323"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">6.2.2 &nbsp; Outliers</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>The strength of the relationship between two variables is usually the most 
  important information that we gain from a scatterplot but a scatterplot may display other features.</p>
<p class="heading">Outliers</p>
<p>Values that seem 'different' from the rest of the data are called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
<p>An outlier may be an extreme value of one or other variable, but an individual
may be an outlier even though neither X nor Y is unusual on its own. One point
is an outlier in each of the three data sets below.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers.gif" id="gif_image_2_2_1" width="312" height="157"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers.svg" id="svg_image_2_2_1" width="312" height="157" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_2_1");</script>       <img class="gif" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers2.gif" id="gif_image_2_2_2" width="142" height="158"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers2.svg" id="svg_image_2_2_2" width="142" height="158" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_2_2");</script></p>
<p>The point is an
outlier in the righthand data set  because it lies well above the main group
of points &mdash; its y-value is much higher than others with similar x-values.</p>
<p class=heading>Importance of outliers</p>
<p>Outliers are features of a data set that <strong>must</strong> be carefully 
	checked. An outlier is often caused by a recording or transcription error, 
	so...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>First check that the values of the variables 
			are correctly recorded.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes an outlier arises because an individual is fundamentally different 
	from the others.  Identifying what makes the individual different  often gives considerable insight into the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The individuals should be further examined (perhaps 
			collecting further information from them) to try to assess whether the 
			outlier individual has distinct characteristics.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An outlier that is either extreme or that has other distinctive characteristics 
	would often be deleted from the data set, but should be mentioned in a report 
	about the data.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">6.2.3 &nbsp; Clusters</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>Sometimes the cloud of crosses separates into two or more groups which are 
		called <strong>clusters</strong>. As with outliers, clusters provide important 
		information that should be further investigated.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/relationship/images/s_clusters.gif" width="241" height="222"></p>
	<p>The individuals should be  examined (perhaps collecting further 
		information from them) to  assess whether the clusters correspond to
 individuals with distinct characteristics. For example, the clusters may correspond
 to males and females, or  two different species of plant.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">6.2.4 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Interpreting outliers or clusters</p>
	<p>We have described some information that may be read from a scatterplot. But
		how strong must the corrresponding patterns be before we should report them? </p>
	<p>In both univariate and bivariate data sets, outliers or clusters must be <strong> distinct</strong> before we should conclude that they are real,
		in the absence of further external information confirming that the
		individuals are distinct. </p>
<p>Particularly in small data sets, outliers, clusters and other patterns may arise <strong>by chance</strong>, without being associated with any real features in the
		individuals. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Be careful not to overinterpret features in scatterplot unless they 
				are well defined, especially if the sample size is small.</p>
</div></div>

	



<h2 class="pageName">6.2.5 &nbsp; Explanatory and response variables</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Causal relationships</p>
	<p>In many bivariate data sets, the relationship between the two variables is 
		not symmetric. From the nature of the variables and the way that the data were collected, it may be clear that one variable, X, can potentially influence the other, Y, but that the opposite is impossible.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln1.gif" id="gif_image_2_5_1" width="297" height="65"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln1.svg" id="svg_image_2_5_1" width="297" height="65" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_5_1");</script></p>
<p>In such data, the variable X is called the <strong>explanatory variable</strong> and Y is called the <strong>response</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading>Experiments</p>
	<p>In an experiment,  the person conducting the experiment controls the values
of the explanatory variable. A well-designed experiment
always ensures that the relationship between the explanatory variable and response
is causal.</p>
<p class=heading>Observational studies</p>
	<p>If the person collecting the data has no control over either of the variables,
and simply records a pair of values from each individual, then the data are called <strong>observational</strong>.
If one variable is an earlier measurement than the other, we may also
be able to treat it as an explanatory variable and the later variable as the
response. </p>
<p>Even if the relationship is not causal, we are sometimes interested in <strong>predicting</strong> the
value of one variable from the other. The variable being predicted would then
be treated as the response.</p>
