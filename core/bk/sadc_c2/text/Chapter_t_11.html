<h1>Chapter 11 &nbsp; Sample Surveys</h1>
<h2>11.1 &nbsp; Sampling schemes</h2>
<h3>11.1.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h3>
<p>More accurate estimates can sometimes be obtained by taking separate random samples within different parts of the population.</p>
<h3>11.1.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h3>
<p>When individuals are grouped in clusters, it is often cheaper to sample complete clusters rather than separate individuals.</p>
<h3>11.1.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling</h3>
<p>When the target population is spread over a wide area, it may be cheaper to take a sample of regions (groups of individuals), than to sample from all the regions.</p>
<h2>11.2 &nbsp; Sampling & non-sampling errors</h2>
<h3>11.2.1 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h3>
<p>Samples are usually collected to estimate population characteristics. The ordinary variation caused by the sampling scheme is called sampling error. Practical difficulties with conducting the survey can cause biased estimates (non-sampling errors).</p>
<h3>11.2.2 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h3>
<p>Coverage error and non-response error prevent some individuals being included in the sample.</p>
<h3>11.2.3 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h3>
<p>Interviewer error and instrument error can result in 'incorrect' measurements from the sampled individuals.</p>
<h2>11.3 &nbsp; Conducting a sample survey</h2>
<h3>11.3.1 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h3>
<p>Survey information is collected by a variety of mechanisms, from mailed questionnaires to telephone. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
