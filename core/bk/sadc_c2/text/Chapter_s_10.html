<p class=heading>Exploratory and descriptive analysis</p>

<p>Sometimes we are interested in a<strong> specific collection of individuals</strong> 
(or other units). When data are collected from these individuals, it is sufficient 
to describe the distribution of values with graphical and numerical descriptive 
statistics. We have <strong>no interest in generalising</strong> from this to 
throw light on a 'wider population of individuals'. </p>

  <p class=heading>Generalising from data</p>

  <p>In contrast, with most data sets, the specific 'individuals' from whom data 
		were collected are of little interest.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data are often 'representative' of something 
					more general.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The main aim with such data is to <strong>generalise from the data</strong>.</p>
	<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>Examples</p>
		<p>The following data sets were collected to provide information about something 
			more general than the specific 'individuals' from whom the values were collected.</p>
<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeGifImage(this)">
<option value="0" selected>Concrete hardness (mL eroded)</option>
<option value="1">Contamination in industrial process (%)</option>

  <p>We can (and should!) still use exploratory graphical and numerical summaries 
		to help understand the distribution of values in data sets such as these above. 
		The data sets give information from which we can try to generalise.</p>
	<p>However our data give <strong>incomplete</strong> information about what 
		is underlying the data &mdash; with more data, we would be able to do better.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We need additional methodology to describe 
					what is meant by this 'generalising' from the data and to describe the

<h2 class="pageName">10.1.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Randomness of data</p>

  <p>The data that we have collected are often representative of something more 
		general. We are not interested in the specific individuals from which we collected 
		information but want to use the measurements from them to generalise.</p>
	<p>However if we collected similar information again (from a different selection 
		of individuals), we would obtain different data values, so we must acknowledge 
		this sample-to-sample variability when interpreting the data. The data are 
		<strong>random</strong>.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>All graphical and numerical summaries would 
					be different if we repeated data collection.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The randomness in the data must be taken into account in our interpretation

<h2 class="pageName">10.1.3 &nbsp; Modelling randomness</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Modelling randomness</p>

  <p>In order to understand the variability of data, we must find a <strong>model</strong> 
		that explains why repeating data collection would result in different data 
		values. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A model that explains randomness can also explain 
					the variability (accuracy) of summary statisics such as means.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class=heading>Samples from a real population</p>

  <p>In some data sets, the individuals from whom data were collected were selected 
		as representatives of a larger group of individuals about whom we are really 
		interested. </p>
		
<div class="diagram">

		<p class=heading>Opinion polls</p>

		<p>Many public opinion polls are conducted to get information about attitudes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Which candidate do you intend to vote for in the coming election?</li>
			<li>Do you use coffee brand A?</li>
			<li>How far do you travel to work or school each day?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In these polls, there is usually a well-defined population of interest 
			&mdash; all people in the region &mdash; but it would be prohibitively expensive to 
			obtain information from everyone. Furthermore, it would be impossible to 
			obtain information from everyone.</p>
		<p>Data are usually obtained from a <strong>subset</strong> of this population.</p>
</div>

	<p class=heading>Simple random samples</p>
	<p>There are various different methods of selecting individuals from a population. 
		The simplest of these is a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In a simple 
		random sample, each individual has the same chance of being selected.</p>
	<p>This mechanism (randomly selecting a sample of <em>n</em> individuals from 
		a larger population) can explain the randomness underlying the observed data.</p>
	<div class="diagram">

		<p class=heading>Shop owners in town</p>

		<p>There are 132 shops in a town that are operated by their owners (therefore 
			excluding shops that are part of national chains). The town council wants

			neither money nor time to do this for all shops.</p>

	<p class=heading>Modelling randomness of data with no concrete population</p>
	<p>We use a similar mechanism to model the randomness of data even when the

		population and treat the data as a simple random sample from this population.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The 'population' can be imagined to be the

<p class=heading>Interest in underlying population</p>

  <p>We explained earlier that the specific individuals from whom data are collected

	<p class=heading>Inference about parameters</p>
	<p>In most practical situations, a few specific characteristics of the population 
		distribution are of most interest. Population characteristics are called population 
		<strong>parameters</strong>. Examples are the population mean of a numerical

<p class="heading">Population and census</p>
	<p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
		fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
		group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
	<p>Collecting measurements  from every item in the  population is called a <strong>census</strong>. A census is rarely feasible,  because of the  cost and time involved.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
	<p>We can usually obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
	collecting information from a selection of units from the population &mdash; a <strong>sample</strong>. Although a sample gives less accurate information than a census, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample  is  
		a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In it, each unit has the same chance 
		of being selected and some random mechanism is used to determine whether any particular unit is 
		included in the sample.	</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	<p>It is convenient 
		to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
		than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
		corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>

<p class="heading">Different sampling schemes</p>
	<p><strong>Two

	<dl>
		<dt>Sampling with replacement (SWR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWR, the first selected value is <strong>returned to the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from all <i>N</i> population values. </dd>
		<dt>Sampling without replacement (SWOR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWOR, the first selected value is <strong>removed from the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from the remaining <i>N</i> - 1 population 
		values, etc.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Since a SWR may contain the same population value more than once, it covers less of the population than SWOR. SWOR therefore gives more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Large populations and/or small samples</p>
	<p>If the sample size, <i>n</i>, is much smaller than the population size, <i>N</i>, 
		there is little practical difference between SWR and SWOR &mdash; there would be little
