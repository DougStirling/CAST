<page dir='en/ciExtra' filePrefix='l_ciExtra1'>This diagram shows that the standard error of a proportion is biggest when p = 0.5.</page>
<page dir='en/ciExtra' filePrefix='l_ciExtra2'>This diagram shows that the margin of error is the '+/-' value in a 95% CI when p is 0.5, but underestimates the accuracy of small or large sample proportions.</page>
<page dir='en/ciExtra' filePrefix='l_ciExtra_c3'>In this diagram, sliders can adjust the standard deviation and sample size and the resulting 95% CI's width is displayed. The sample size can be increased until the CI width is less than the target accuracy. </page>
<page dir='en/ciExtra' filePrefix='l_ciExtra4'>This diagram is similar to that on the previous page but displays the width of 95% CIs for a proportion. It allows the sample size to be increased until a 95% CI is narrow enough.</page>
<page dir='en/ciExtra' filePrefix='l_ciExtra5'>This is a simulation of CIs for a mean (know popn SD) in which a slider can change the constant 1.96 to other values. The proportion including the popn mean changes corresponding to different confidence levels.</page>
