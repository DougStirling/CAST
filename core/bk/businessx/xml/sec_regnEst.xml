<page dir='en/regnEst' filePrefix='l_regnEst_c1'>This page gives a real example where the least squares slope and intercept estimate these parameters of a regression model. A simulation also shows that these estimates are random.</page>
<page dir='en/regnEst' filePrefix='l_regnEst_c2'>In this diagram a line can be dragged on a scatterplot. The sum of squared residuals is shown and can be minimised by a least squares button. The estimate of the error standard deviation is then displayed.</page>
<page dir='en/regnEst' filePrefix='l_regnEst3'>This simulation builds up the distributions of the least squares slope and intercept, and shows their theoretical normal distributions.</page>
<page dir='en/regnEst' filePrefix='l_regnEst_c4'>This diagram gives the calculations for the standard error of the least squares slope and the estimated error distributions for several real data sets.</page>
<page dir='en/regnEst' filePrefix='l_regnEst5'>This simulation shows that about 95% of the 95% CIs include the underlying model's slope.</page>
<page dir='en/regnEst' filePrefix='l_regnEst6'>This diagram shows that the accuracy of the least squares slope depends on the sample size, error standard deviation and the spread of x-values. Use it to discuss design of experiments for regression data.</page>
