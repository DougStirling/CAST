<page dir='en/testMean' filePrefix='l_testMean1'>This diagram repeats an earlier simulation for testing a normal mean when &amp;sigma; is known. The diagram can replace the simulation results with the theoretical normal distribution to find the p-value without a simulation. The diagram can also show the simulation results and theoretical distribution in terms of z-scores â€” 'statistical distance'.</page>
<page dir='en/testMean' filePrefix='l_testMean2'>This diagram shows how the p-value is obtained for a particular data set. A slider can change the sample mean to show how this affects the p-value.</page>
<page dir='en/testMean' filePrefix='l_testMean3'>This is a simulation that builds up the distribution of the t statistic for different sample sizes. It compares this empirical distribution to a standard normal distribution and shows that it has higher spread, especially when the sample size is low.</page>
<page dir='en/testMean' filePrefix='l_testMean4'>This diagram superimposes a standard normal distribution on the t distribution. Changing the degrees of freedom with a slider shows its extra spread when the degrees of freedom are small.</page>
<page dir='en/testMean' filePrefix='l_testMean_c5'>This diagram shows how the p-value is obtained for a real data set when the population standard deviation is unknown. A slider can change the sample mean to show how this affects the p-value.</page>
