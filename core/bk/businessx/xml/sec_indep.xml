<page dir='en/indep' filePrefix='l_indep_c1'>This page shows two sets of joint probabilities; one has independent variables and the variables are associated in the other. (The context makes it easy to interpret both types of model.)</page>
<page dir='en/indep' filePrefix='l_indep2'>A 3-dimensional bar chart shows that the conditional probabilities are equal if there is independence.</page>
<page dir='en/indep' filePrefix='l_indep_c3'>This is a static example of a contingency table. Is it consistent with independence in the underlying model?</page>
<page dir='en/indep' filePrefix='l_indep4'>This simulation shows that the raw sum of squared differences between observed and estimated cell counts has a distribution that depends on the sample size, but the chi-squared test statistic has a distribution that is (approx) the same whatever the sample size and table margins.</page>
<page dir='en/indep' filePrefix='l_indep5'>This diagram shows the shape of the chi-squared distribution for different numbers of contingency table rows and columns.</page>
<page dir='en/indep' filePrefix='l_indep6'>This diagram shows how the p-value for testing independence is found from the tail aria of the chi-squared distribution. Samples can be generated from an independence model showing that the p-values are rectangularly distributed between 0 and 1.</page>
<page dir='en/indep' filePrefix='l_indep_c7'>The chi-squared test is applied to a few real data sets and the results are interpreted.</page>
<page dir='en/indep' filePrefix='l_indep_c8'>This page gives some examples where the chi-squared test is used to test whether the conditional probabilities are the same in several groups.</page>
