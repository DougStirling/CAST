<page dir='en/correlation' filePrefix='l_correlation_c1'>In a scatterplot, the units of the two variables can be changed, showing that the strength of the relationship should be invariant to linear scaling.</page>
<page dir='en/correlation' filePrefix='l_correlation2'>This diagram illustrates how z-scores are found and interpreted.</page>
<page dir='en/correlation' filePrefix='l_correlation3'>This is a 3-dimensional diagram with z-scores for X and Y on two axes and a surface representing their product and crosses for the data points are shown on the surface. The correlation coefficient is a kind of average of these products. A slider can change the correlation between X and Y.</page>
<page dir='en/correlation' filePrefix='l_correlation4'>In this scatterplot, you can adjust the sample size and the correlation between X and Y and can generate multiple samples. It can be used to give a feel for what r = 0.5, r = -0.9, etc, tell you about the data.</page>
<page dir='en/correlation' filePrefix='l_correlation5'>This diagram is a scatterplot where Y is an exact quadratic function of X. The curvature can be altered with a slider to show that r can be much less than 1.</page>
<page dir='en/correlation' filePrefix='l_correlation6'>This diagram shows four data sets with same summary statistics (including r). One has a moderately strong linear relationship, the second has curvature, the third has an outlier, and the fourth has a single high-leverage point.</page>
