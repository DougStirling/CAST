<page dir='en/regnGroups' filePrefix='l_regnGroups1'>A scatterplot of Y vs X with LS line is dynamically linked to a data matrix that also contains further variables. It is used to explain that the extra variables may help to predict Y.</page>
<page dir='en/regnGroups' filePrefix='l_regnGroups2'>In this scatterplot of Y vs X, the crosses can be coloured to represent a categorical variable, Z.</page>
<page dir='en/regnGroups' filePrefix='l_regnGroups3'>This diagram shows a scatterplot of Y vs X and can display either a single common least squares line or separate least squares lines for the different groups.</page>
<page dir='en/regnGroups' filePrefix='l_regnGroups4'>This diagram can be used to explain why interpretation of the parameters is easier when the least squares lines for different groups are constrained to be parallel.</page>
<page dir='en/regnGroups' filePrefix='l_regnGroups5'>In this diagram, least squares lines for two groups have different slopes, but if the response is replaced by its logarithm, parallel lines are reasonable. The parallel lines can be interpreted as the expected response in one group being a constant multiple of the other (on average).</page>
<page dir='en/regnGroups' filePrefix='l_regnGroups6'>This simple diagram shows an example in which groups are defined from values of an ancillary numerical variable.</page>
<page dir='en/regnGroups' filePrefix='l_regnGroups_c7'>In this example, different symbols are used to distinguish groups in a scatterplot matrix.</page>
