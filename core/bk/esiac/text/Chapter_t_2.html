<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Displaying Data</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Dot plots</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Analysing variation</h3>
<p>Meaningful information can be obtained from variation in the values of a variable.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Basic dot plot</h3>
<p>A dot plot displays each value as a cross along a numerical axis</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h3>
<p>Jittering is a modification to the basic dot plot that avoids some problems associated with overlapping crosses</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h3>
<p>Stacking of the crosses is an alternative to jittering that highlights ranges of high or low density.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>Stem and leaf plots are similar to stacked dot plots, but a digit is used instead of a cross to retain information about the position of each value within its cross.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h3>
<p>To increase the flexibility of the display, each stem may be repeated either 2 or 5 times, increasing the number of classes in the basic stem and leaf plot by a factor of 2 or 5.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>For data analysis, stem and leaf plots are rarely more informative than stacked dot plots, but they are easy to draw by hand.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Understanding distributions</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>Does the data contain any outliers -- values that are atypically large or small? The extreme values in a skew distribution are often mistaken for outliers.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>Does the data split into separate clusters -- ranges of values with high density separated by ranges with low density? Clusters may correspond to different groups of individuals.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h3>
<p>The distribution gives information about a typical value round which the data are spread (the distribution's location or centre) and the variability of the values (the spread of the distribution).</p>
<h3>2.3.4 &nbsp; Extra information about individuals</h3>
<p>Additional information about the items from which measurements have been made can help us understand the distribution of values in the data.</p>
<h3>2.3.5 &nbsp; Distinguishing known groups</h3>
<p>If we know that the values come from 2 or more groups of individuals, dot plots can be modified to show this extra information.</p>
<h3>2.3.6 &nbsp; Dangers of overinterpretation</h3>
<p>There is a risk of over-interpreting patterns in small data sets.</p>
