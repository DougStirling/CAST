<h1>Chapter 3 &nbsp; Estimating Parameters</h1>
<h2>3.1 &nbsp; Introduction to estimation</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 &nbsp; Interest in populations</h3>
<p>When data are collected, we are usually more interested in the unknown population distribution from which we assume that the data were generated.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 &nbsp; Interest in parameters</h3>
<p>A few numerical summaries of a population distribution (parameters) often capture its most interesting characteristics. The corresponding sample statistics provide estimates.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 &nbsp; Applications of estimation</h3>
<p>This page gives a few examples where sample statistics are used to estimate important population parameters.</p>
<h3>3.1.4 &nbsp; Estimation error</h3>
<p>The difference between the population parameter and a sample estimate is called the error in the estimate.</p>
<h3>3.1.5 &nbsp; Distribution of errors</h3>
<p>Estimation errors vary from sample to sample and have distributions.</p>
<h3>3.1.6 &nbsp; Standard error and bias</h3>
<p>A good estimator has errors that are close to zero. The error distribution should ideally be centred on zero (unbiased) and have low standard deviation (standard error). The standard error is the standard deviation of both the estimator and the estimation error.</p>
<h3>3.1.7 &nbsp; Interval estimates</h3>
<p>An interval estimate is a range of values within which we are 'confident' that the unknown population parameter lies.</p>
<h2>3.2 &nbsp; Standard error of mean</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 &nbsp; Error distribution for mean</h3>
<p>When using a sample mean to estimate a population mean, the errors have a distribution with mean zero. The standard deviation of the errors (standard error) is the standard deviation of the sample mean.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 &nbsp; Standard error when σ is known</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be evaluated.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 &nbsp; Interpreting the standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error has about 95% probability of being within 2 standard errors of zero and is almost certainly within 3 standard errors.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 &nbsp; Standard error when σ is unknown</h3>
<p>In most practical applications, the population standard deviation is unknown. The standard error of the sample mean can be approximated by replacing the population standard deviation by the sample standard deviation in its formula.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 &nbsp; Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the interpretation (and value) of the standard error (SE) and standard deviation (SD).</p>
<h3>3.2.6 &nbsp; Using SEs to compare estimators</h3>
<p>If there are two alternative estimators of a parameter, the estimator with lower standard error is usually better. The sample mean is shown to be a better estimator of the centre of a normal population than the sample median. </p>
<h3>3.2.7 &nbsp; More about bias</h3>
<p>Unbiased estimators are usually preferred. The sample median is shown to be a biased estimator of the mean of a skew distribution.</p>
<h2>3.3 &nbsp; Standard error of proportion</h2>
<h3>3.3.1 &nbsp; General framework for estimation</h3>
<p>The methodology for describing the accuracy of a sample mean using standard errors can also be used for other parameter estimates.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 &nbsp; Estimating a proportion</h3>
<p>A sample proportion estimates the corresponding population proportion. There is likely to be an error in this estimate. The estimation errors have a distribution.</p>
<h3>3.3.3 &nbsp; Error distribution</h3>
<p>The estimation errors have a type of binomial distribution that is scaled to have mean zero. Its standard deviation is the standard error of the proportion.</p>
<h3>3.3.4 &nbsp; Normal approximation to error distribution</h3>
<p>If the sample size is high enough, the error distribution is approximately normal. This page gives a few examples for which the error distribution is found.</p>
