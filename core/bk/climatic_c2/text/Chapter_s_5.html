<h2 class="pageName">5.1.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>A simple random sample of individuals from a population is the easiest sampling scheme to understand, but other sampling schemes may give more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Grouping of individuals</p>
	<p>If the individuals in the population can be split into different groups (called <strong>strata</strong> in sampling terminology), it is often better to take a 
		simple random sample <strong>within each separate group</strong> than to sample 
		randomly from the whole population. This is called a <strong>stratified random 
			sample</strong>.</p>
	<p>The  proportion sampled from the different strata are usually fixed to be the same as the proportions of individuals in the strata in the population. In a simple random sample, the proportions sampled from the strata might not match the population proportions, so a stratified random sample should be more 'representative'.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/sampPractice/images/s_stratified.gif" width="418" height="351"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling frame</p>
	<p>Before taking a simple random sample or stratified random sample, a complete 
		list of all individuals in the target population must be available. This is called a <strong>sampling 
			frame</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
	<p>If a complete sampling frame is not available, it may be possible to group the target individuals into reasonably 
	small groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>, for which a complete list is available.</p>
	<p>Clusters are similar to the strata that are used for stratified sampling, but 
		are usually much smaller. For example, a cluster might contain all of the houses in a street, or all of the individuals in a household. It is not necessary to know beforehand how many individuals are in each of the clusters.</p>
	<p>For cluster sampling, a <strong>simple random sample of clusters</strong> is 
		selected, with all individuals in these clusters selected.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cost advantages</p>
	<p>Even when a complete sampling frame is available, cluster sampling might be 
		used to reduce the cost of sampling (or to increase the sample size for the same 
		cost) since it is often cheaper to record information from individuals in the 
		same cluster than from different parts of the sampling frame.</p>
	<p class="heading">Accuracy of cluster sampling</p>
	<p>The disadvantage of cluster sampling is that estimates are usually less accurate than the corresponding estimates from 
	a simple random sample of the same size.</p>
	<p>However the cost advantages would permit a larger sample size, so cluster sampling may give the best estimates <strong>for a fixed cost</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling from large populations</p>
	<p>Two-stage sampling is a sampling scheme that is related to cluster sampling, 
		but is of most use for large populations when the individuals are very widely 
		separated in some sense. For example, many polls are conducted to obtain <strong>national</strong> information about voting intentions or consumer purchases, and there is a high 
		cost associated with travelling between different regions.</p>
	<p>In two-stage sampling, the population is separated into groups of adjacent 
		individuals called <strong>primary sampling units</strong>. These primary sampling 
		units are typically large &mdash; for example a country might be split into 20 or more 
		regions. A small number of these are selected according to some sampling scheme, 
		then individuals are sub-sampled within each selected primary unit.</p>
	<p>Costs are reduced by limiting sampling to a small number of primary units. 
		For example, if individuals are only sampled from within say 5 regions, travelling 
		and accommodation costs will be considerably reduced.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">5.2.1 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Estimation</p>
	<p>The aim of sampling is usually to <strong>estimate</strong> one or more population 
		values (parameters) from a sample. Because we do not have complete information about the population, the estimate is unlikely to be <strong>exactly</strong> same as the value that we are estimating, 
		so we call the difference the <strong>error</strong> in the estimate. There are 
		different kinds of error.</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling error</p>
	<p>We have presented four different ways to sample from a population</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Simple random sample</li>
		<li>Stratified sample</li>
		<li>Cluster sample</li>
		<li>Two-stage sample</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each of these involves randomness in the sample-selection process. The error caused by randomness in the sampling process is called <strong>sampling 
			error</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Non-sampling error</p>
	<p>When sampling from some types of population &mdash; especially human populations 
		&mdash; problems often arise when conducting one of the above sampling schemes. For 
		example, some sampled people are likely to refuse to participate in your study.</p>
	<p>Such difficulties also result in errors and these are called <strong>non-sampling 
		errors</strong>. Non-sampling errors can be much higher than sampling errors 
		and are much more serious. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike sampling errors, the likely size of non-sampling errors cannot be estimated 
			from a single sample &mdash; it is extremely difficult to assess their likely size.</li>
		<li>Non-sampling errors often distort estimates by pulling them in one direction. 
			The estimates are then called <strong>biased</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is therefore important to design a survey to minimise the risk of non-sampling 
		errors.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.2 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
	<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
		from some members of the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>
	<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
		the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
		the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
		only a subgroup of it.</p>
	<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>
	<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Failure to contact the individuals.</li>
		<li>Refusal to participate in the study.</li>
		<li>Refusal to answer particular questions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
		survey are likely to be biased.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.3 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>'Inaccurate' responses</p>
	<p>The next two types of non-sampling error are caused by inaccurate information 
		being obtained from the sampled individuals.</p>
	<p class=heading>Instrument error</p>
	<p><strong>Instrument error</strong> usually results from poorly designed
		questions. Different wording of questions can lead to different answers being 
		given by a respondent. The wording of the question may be such as to elicit some
		particular response (a <strong>leading</strong> question) or it may simply be carelessly
		worded so that it is misinterpreted by some respondents. </p>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer error</p>
	<p><strong>Interviewer error</strong> occurs when some characteristic of the interviewer, such
		as age or sex, affects the way in which respondents answer questions.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">5.3.1 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>There are various different ways to collect information from human populations. 
	Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
	<p class=heading>Telephone</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response can be high.</li>
		<li>Coverage error is small.</li>
		<li>The number of questions must be kept very small.</li>
		<li>Inexpensive, so sample sizes can be greater.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Mailed questionnaire</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response is very high.</li>
		<li>Costs are higher than in a telephone survey.</li>
		<li>Mailed questionnaires can contain more questions than telephone surveys.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lowest non-response and other sampling errors.</li>
		<li>Interviewers must be well trained to reduce interviewer error.</li>
		<li>Most expensive.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires can be fairly long.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Houses are rarely selected at random. Often streets are randomly selected and every
		5th or 10th house in the street is approached. This is called a <strong>systematic
			sample</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Street corner</p>
	<p>Some surveys are conducted by approaching people in busy shopping centres or
		similar public places. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Large coverage errors.</li>
		<li>Least expensive and therefore widely used.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires must be small.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To reduce coverage errors, a <strong>quota sample</strong> is often used. Each 
		interviewer is told to interview fixed numbers of old, young, male, female, etc. 
		respondents to match the 
		corresponding proportion in the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Self-selected</p>
	<p>Phone-in or mail-in surveys are often conducted by radio stations and magazines. The
		respondents are usually so unrepresentative that the results are meaningless. These types
		of survey should be avoided. </p>
