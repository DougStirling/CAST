<h2 class="pageName">6.1.1 &nbsp; Inference</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Inference</p>
<p><strong>Statistical inference</strong> refers to statistical
	techniques for obtaining information about a population parameter (or parameters) from
	a  random sample. There are two branches of inference:</p>
<p class=heading>Estimation</p>
<p>Point estimates and confidence intervals give answers to questions of the form:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>What parameter values would be consistent with the sample data?</p></div></div>
<p class=heading>Hypothesis tests</p>
<p>This chapter deals with a related type of question:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>Are the sample data consistent with some statement about the parameters?</p></div></div>
<p class=heading>Errors and strength of evidence</p>
<p>A single random sample can rarely provide enough information 
	about a population parameter to allow us to be sure whether or not any statement (hypothesis)
	about that parameter will be true. The best we can hope for is an indication of 
	the <strong>strength of the evidence</strong> against it. </p>




<h2 class="pageName">6.1.2 &nbsp; Soccer league simulation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Randomness in sports results</p>
<p>Although we like to think that the 'best' team wins in sports competitions, 
there is actually considerable variability in the results that 
can only be explained through randomness. For example when  two teams play a series
of matches, the same team rarely wins all matches.</p>
<p class=heading>English Premier Soccer League, 2008/09</p>
<p>In the English Premier Soccer league, each team plays every other 
team twice (home and away) during the season. Three points are awarded for a win 
and one point for a draw. The table below shows the wins, draws, losses and total 
points for all teams at the end of the 2008/09 season.</p>

<p class=heading>Were all teams evenly matched?</p>
<p>A simulation can help us to investigate this question. We could be used to generate results from all 380 matches in the season for evenly matched teams, each result having probabilities 0.372, 0.372 and 0.255 of being a win, loss or draw for the home team. (A proportion 0.255 of games in the actual league resulted in draws.)</p>
<p>If there are differences between teams, we would expect the worst teams to have very few points at the end of the season and the best to have many. On the other hand, for evenly matched teams, we would expect all 20 finals points to be similar. The <strong>spread of final points</strong> in the league table should tell us something about whether the teams are evenly matched.</p>
<p>In the actual league table, the standard deviation of the final points for the 20 teams was 18.236. The diagram below shows the standard deviations in 200 simulated league tables with evenly matched teams.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testIntro/images/s_leagueSdSim.gif" width="357" height="150"> </p>
<p>Since the probabilities in one tail of the distribution are added, this is
called a <strong>one-tailed test</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">P-value for a two-tailed test</p>
<p>If the alternative hypothesis allows <strong>either high or low</strong> values
of <em>x</em>, the test is called a <strong>two-tailed</strong> test, </p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span></p>
<p>The p-value is then <strong>double the smaller tail probability</strong> since
values of <em>x</em> in <strong>both</strong> tails of the binomial distribution
would provide evidence for <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>In a population of people, a proportion 0.574 have blood group O. In a 
sub-group of this population, a sample of 54 individuals were tested and 26 of
these had blood group O. Is there any evidence that they differ from the main
population?</p>
<p>This question can be expressed with the hypotheses</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.574</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 0.574</strong></span></p>
<p>If the sub-group had the same proportion with blood group O as the main population,
the number out of 54 with this blood group would have the binomial distribution
below.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testPropn/images/s_binom2Tail.gif" width="356" height="212"> </p>
<p class="heading">Approximate p-value</p>

<p>If <em>n</em> is large, the approximate normal distribution for <em>x</em> can

<p class="heading">Adverse reactions to drug</p>
<p>A pharmaceutical company claims that only 1% of a drug's users experience
adverse reactions. An agency monitors 2500 patients taking the
drug and observes adverse reactions in 37 cases. Is the occurrence of adverse reactions
more common than claimed by the company?</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.01</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; 0.01</strong></span></p>

<p>with a standard normal distribution. Since <em>x</em> is discrete,</p>
<p class="eqn">P(<em>X</em> ≥ 37) &nbsp; = &nbsp;P(<em>X</em> ≤ 36.5) &nbsp; = &nbsp; P(<em>X</em> ≤
36.9) &nbsp; = &nbsp; ...</p>
<p>To find this tail probability, any value of <em>x</em> between 36 and 37
might have been used when evaluating the z-score. The p-value can be more accurately
estimate by using 36.5. This is called a <strong>continuity correction</strong>.
This more accurate p-value in the above example is 0.011 leading to a similar conclusion.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The continuity correction involves <strong>either adding or subtracting 0.5</strong> from
the observed count, <em>x</em>, before finding the z-score.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">6.2.6 &nbsp; Statistical distance</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Difference between parameter and estimate</p>
<p>If the  value of a parameter
specified by the null hypothesis (e.g. a population proportion, π<sub>0</sub>) is
close to the corresponding sample statistic (e.g. the sample proportion, <em>p</em>)
then there is no reason to doubt the null hypothesis. However if they
are far apart, the data are not consistent with the null hypothesis and we should
conclude that the alternative hypothesis holds.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A large distance between the estimate and hypothesized value gives evidence
against the null hypothesis.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Statistical distance</p>
<p>To help assess this difference, we express it as a <strong>number of standard
errors</strong> since we know from the 70-95-100 rule of thumb that that
2 (standard errors) is a large distance, 3 is a very large distance, and 1 is
not much.</p>
<p>For a proportion, the number of standard errors is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/testPropn/images/zForP.gif" width="186" height="56"></p>
<p>In general, the <strong>statistical distance</strong> of an estimate to a
hypothesised value of the underlying parameter is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/testMean/images/zGeneral.gif" width="185" height="37"></p>
<p>Values more than 2, or less than -2,  suggests that the hypothesized
value is wrong. However if <em>z</em> is close to zero, <em>p</em> is reasonably
close to π<sub>0</sub> and we should not doubt the null hypothesis.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">6.2.7 &nbsp; Tests based on statistical distance</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Test statistic and p-value</p>
<p>The <strong>statistical distance</strong> of an estimate to a hypothesised
value of the underlying parameter is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/testMean/images/zGeneral.gif" width="185" height="37"></p>
<p>If the null hypothesis holds, <em>z</em> has
approximately a standard normal distribution and it can be used as a test statistic
for tests about the parameter. The p-value can be determined from the tail areas
of this standard normal distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/testMean/images/pValueFromZ.gif" width="471" height="212"></p>
<p>For a two-tailed test, the p-value is the red tail area and can be looked
up using either normal tables or in Excel.</p>
<p class=heading>Example</p>
<p>We again examine a data set in which a proportion <sup>37</sup>/<sub>2500</sub> = 0.0148 of
2,500 patients had adverse reactions to a drug. Do more than 1% of such patients
have adverse reactions?</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.01</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; 0.01</strong></span></p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the 'statistical distance' of the sample proportion
from 0.01 is calculated.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testPropn/images/s_testP_b.gif" width="419" height="224"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the upper tail area of the standard normal distribution
and is 0.0079 here, so we again conclude that there is strong evidence that more
than 1% of patients have adverse reactions from the drug.</p>
<p>Using a 'statistical distance' to test a proportion gives a p-value that is <strong>identical</strong> to
the p-value based on a normal approximation to the number of successes <strong>without</strong> a
continuity correction. (The p-value is slightly different if a continuity correction
is used.) However this approach will  be used to  test many different
kinds of parameter in later sections.</p>
<p>(The procedure will be refined slightly 
when applied to situations where the standard error of the estimate must itself
be estimated from the sample data. A t distribution will be used instead of a
standard normal distribution.)</p>
