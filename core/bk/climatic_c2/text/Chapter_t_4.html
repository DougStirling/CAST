<h1>Chapter 4 &nbsp; Confidence Intervals</h1>
<h2>4.1 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 &nbsp; Confidence interval from standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error for any unbiased estimator, has approximately 0.95 probability of being between -2SE and +2SE. An approximate 95% confidence interval for the parameter is therefore the estimate ± 2SE.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean, known σ</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be found exactly. A 95% confidence interval is the sample mean ± twice this. (Or more exactly, 1.96 times the standard error.)</p>
<h3>4.1.3 &nbsp; Confidence level</h3>
<p>A simulation shows that 95% confidence intervals are random — they vary from sample to sample. About 95% of samples give confidence intervals that include the true parameter.</p>
<h3>4.1.4 &nbsp; Confidence level if σ is replaced by s</h3>
<p>In practice, the population standard deviation is usually unknown. If the population SD is simply replaced by its sample equivalent, the interval estimate has a lower confidence level than 95%.</p>
<h3>4.1.5 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean, unknown σ</h3>
<p>To get a 95% confidence level, a t-value from tables must replace the constant 1.96.</p>
<h3>4.1.6 &nbsp; Properties of 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>A simulation demonstrates that the resulting 95% confidence intervals have probability 0.95 of including the population mean.</p>
<h3>4.1.7 &nbsp; Examples</h3>
<p>Some examples of 95% confidence intervals for population means are given and interpreted.</p>
<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Confidence interval for proportion</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Confidence interval for proportion</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence interval for a population proportion is the sample proportion +/- twice its standard deviation. Its confidence level is only approximately 95% and guidelines are given for the minimum sample size.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; Properties of 95% CI for proportion</h3>
<p>If samples are repeatedly taken, about 95% of them result in 95% confidence intervals that include the population proportion. Guidelines are given for the minimum sample size to make the confidence level close to 95%.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; Confidence interval examples</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence intervals for a proportion are found and interpreted for several data sets.</p>
