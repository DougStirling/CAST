<p class=heading>Exploratory and descriptive analysis</p>

<p>Sometimes we are interested in a<strong> specific collection of individuals</strong> 
(or other units). When data are collected from these individuals, it is sufficient 
to describe the distribution of values with graphical and numerical descriptive 
statistics. We have <strong>no interest in generalising</strong> from this to 
throw light on a 'wider population of individuals'. </p>

			in each of the states in the USA. <strong>Click</strong> on crosses to determine 
			the names of the corresponding states. </p>

<p>We are only interested in describing these specific 50 states, not on generalising to any
'wider population of states'.

  <p class=heading>Generalising from data</p>

  <p>In contrast, with most data sets, the specific 'individuals' from whom data 
		were collected are of little interest.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data are often 'representative' of something 
					more general.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The main aim with such data is to <strong>generalise from the data</strong>.</p>
	<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>Examples</p>
		<p>The following data sets were collected to provide information about something 
			more general than the specific 'individuals' from whom the values were collected.</p>
<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeGifImage(this)">
<option value="0" selected>Concrete hardness (mL eroded)</option>
<option value="1">Contamination in industrial process (%)</option>
<option value="2">Maximum voluntary isometric strength (kg)</option>
<option value="3">Mammal thigh bone shape</option>
<option value="4">Paint primer thickness (mil)</option>
</select>
</form>

		<p><img src="../images/concrete.gif" width="559" height="209"></p>
	<p class="heading">Sample information about the population</p>
	<p>In practice, we only have a single sample and this provides  <strong>incomplete information about the population</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/popSamp/images/samplingHistos2.gif" width="423" height="120"></p>
	<p class="heading">Effect of sample size</p>
	<p>Bigger samples mean more stable and reliable information about the underlying population.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Estimating means and proportions</p>
	<p>A random sample is often used to <strong>estimate</strong> some  numerical characteristic of the population, such as...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The mean of some variable</li>
		<li>The proportion in some category</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The difference between an estimate and the population value being estimated is called 
		its <strong>sampling error</strong>. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/popSamp/images/s_propnMean.gif" width="494" height="394"></p>
	<p class="heading">Bar charts and the law of large numbers</p>
	<p>The law of large numbers states that sample proportions approach  the underlying probabilities as the sample size increases. This means that a sample bar chart will be close in shape to the unknown population bar chart if the sample size is big enough.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.4 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Histograms and probability density functions</p>
	<p>The situation is a little more complicated for continuous numerical populations and samples. A standard histogram could be used to describe the population in the same way that it might be used for a sample:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probDensity/images/histogram.gif" width="192" height="154"></p>
	<p>However with an infinite population, we can narrow the histogram classes beyond what would be reasonable for a finite sample. Indeed, class widths can be reduced indefinitely, resulting in a smooth histogram called a <strong>probability density function</strong>. This is often abbreviated to a <strong>pdf</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probDensity/images/pdf.gif" width="192" height="154"></p>
	<p>Probability density functions are still essentially histograms and share all properties of histograms.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.5 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Shape of a probability density function</p>
	<p>A probability density function  is usually a fairly smooth curve, though a single sample histogram  provides limited information about its likely shape.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/unknownPopn.gif" width="362" height="236"></p>
	<p>A value can be generated from a rectangular distribution with the Excel function &quot;=RAND()&quot; or, by hand, by  generating a sequence of
	random digits (e.g. by rolling a 10-sided die).</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.5.6 &nbsp; Generating categorical values</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Generating a categorical value</p>
	<p>A random category can be generated from a rectangularly distributed random value, <span class="em black">r</span> .</p>
	<p>If P(<em>success</em>)  is denoted by the symbol <span class="black">π</span>, 
		then a <em>success</em> will be generated if <span class="em black">r</span>  is less than <span class="black">π</span>. This can be generalised as illustrated in the diagram below:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_randomCat.gif" width="340" height="274"></p>
	<p>A random position within the rectangle is generated with a random rectangular horizontal and vertical positions. If it lies within the density function, the x-coordinate is the generated value. Otherwise more positions within the rectangle are generated until a point is found within the density function.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_envelopeReject.gif" width="413" height="234"></p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_envelopeAccept.gif" width="413" height="234"></p>
