<page dir='en/pairBlock' filePrefix='l_pairBlock1'>This simulation shows a collection of experimental units whose characteristics differ. The treatment effect in a completely randomised experiment is inaccurately estimated. By choosing experimental units that are more similar, the accuracy of the estimate is improved considerably.</page>
<page dir='en/pairBlock' filePrefix='l_pairBlock2'>This simulation shows that grouping the varying experimental units into matched pairs and randomising treatments within pairs results in estimates that are as accurate as if all experimental units were initially similar.</page>
<page dir='en/pairBlock' filePrefix='l_pairBlock3'>This diagram animates the allocation of treatments to experimental units in a completely randomised design and in a randomised block design with matched pairs.</page>
<page dir='en/pairBlock' filePrefix='l_pairBlock4'>This simulation extends the simulation on the 2nd page of this section with matched groups of 3 experimental units in an experiment with 3 factor levels. Again the randomised block experiment estimates factor effects much more accurately than in a completely randomised one.</page>
<page dir='en/pairBlock' filePrefix='l_pairBlock5'>This page shows several data sets from randomised block experiments of different kinds. One involves matched groups but the others use naturally occurring blocks.</page>
