<page dir='en/randomPropn' filePrefix='l_randomPropn1'>This diagram shows that a sample propn is random and builds up the sampling distribution of the sample count and the sample proportion. It also shows the effect of sample size.</page>
<page dir='en/randomPropn' filePrefix='l_randomPropn2'>This diagram shows how the sample size and probability of success affect the shape of the binomial distribution.</page>
<page dir='en/randomPropn' filePrefix='l_randomPropn3'>This page presents a few worked examples of finding the probability that a binomial variable is within a range.</page>
<page dir='en/randomPropn' filePrefix='l_randomPropn4'>Diagrams showing that a binomial distribution is approximately normal if the sample size is large.</page>
<page dir='en/randomPropn' filePrefix='l_randomPropn5'>This page presents a few worked examples of finding probabilities using a normal approximation to the binomial distribution when the sample size is large.</page>
