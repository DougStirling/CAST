<page dir='en/prob' filePrefix='l_prob1'>This page shows a simulation of samples from a model with known joint probabilities then presents a real data set where the underlying probabilities are unknown.</page>
<page dir='en/prob' filePrefix='l_prob2'>This 3-dimensional bar chart shows the stacking of the bars representing joint probabilities to give the marginal probabilities.</page>
<page dir='en/prob' filePrefix='l_prob3'>In this 3-dimensional bar chart, the rows (or columns) of bars are separately scaled to give the conditional distributions.</page>
<page dir='en/prob' filePrefix='l_prob4'>This diagram graphically displays joint, marginal and conditional probabilities and shows the relationships beween the three sets of probabilities.</page>
<page dir='en/prob' filePrefix='l_prob5'>This diagram shows the calculations involved in Bayes theorem.</page>
<page dir='en/prob' filePrefix='l_prob6'>This diagram shows how P(x given y) can be low when P(y given x) is high.</page>
