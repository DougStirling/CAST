<section name='Median, quartiles &amp;amp; box plots'>

<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot1'>An example allows you to switch between various displays to compare five groups. Dot plots contain distracting detail; histograms are better; but box plots highlight the important differences between the groups.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot2'>A diagram shows how a box plot splits the data into quarters. You can drag the quartiles to show how the box plot shape relates to the distribution of values in a dot plot. It can also show how the median and quartiles split a histogram area into quarters (approximately).</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot3'>Sliders can change the centre, spread, skewness and tails of a data set, showing how these affect the shape of the box plot.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot4'>One diagram shows that a basic box plot cannot distinguish between a skew distribution and a symmetric distribution with an outlier. A second diagram explains which values in an improved box plot are separately displayed as crosses; in it, values can be dragged to become outliers.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot5'>One diagram transforms a regular distribution into one with clusters and shows that box plots cannot display clusters. A real example with clusters is also displayed.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot6'>A real example shows how box plots effectively summarise the differences between 12 groups.</page>
