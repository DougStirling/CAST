<page dir='en/regnTest' filePrefix='l_regnTest1'>Demonstration that zero slope means that X does not affect Y.</page>
<page dir='en/regnTest' filePrefix='l_regnTest2'>A simulation shows that the least squares slope is usually not zero even if the underlying model slope is zero.</page>
<page dir='en/regnTest' filePrefix='l_regnTest3'>The diagram shows how the p-value for testing zero slope is found for a few data sets and it gives an interpretation of the test results.</page>
<page dir='en/regnTest' filePrefix='l_regnTest4'>This is a static diagram that can be used to help discuss the different interpretations of the correlation coefficient and the p-value for testing for zero slope.</page>
<page dir='en/regnTest' filePrefix='l_regnTest5'>This simulation illustrates that the p-value for testing zero slope is rectangularly distributed between 0 and 1 if the model slope is zero, but is usually closer to 0 if the model slope is nonzero.</page>
