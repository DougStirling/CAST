<page dir='en/seasonal' filePrefix='l_seasonal1'>This is an example of a time series with a seasonal pattern.</page>
<page dir='en/seasonal' filePrefix='l_seasonal2'>This diagram applies n-point moving averages to a monthly data set and shows that 12-point moving averages remove seasonal variation.</page>
<page dir='en/seasonal' filePrefix='l_seasonal3'>This diagram shows 12-point moving averages on a monthly time series. Clicking on any value highlights all residuals for that month and shows that the seasonal effect for that month is the average of these residuals.</page>
<page dir='en/seasonal' filePrefix='l_seasonal4'>In this diagram, the seasonal effects are subtracted from each raw value in the time series, giving deseasonalised values.</page>
<page dir='en/seasonal' filePrefix='l_seasonal5'>This diagram allows the four components -- seasonal, trend, cyclical and residual -- to be removed from a series and displayed separately.</page>
<page dir='en/seasonal' filePrefix='l_seasonal6'>In this diagram, the seasonal, trend and cyclical components can be extended into the future and added to forecast future values. </page>
