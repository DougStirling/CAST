<page dir='en/smoothing' filePrefix='l_smoothing1'>This diagram illustrates how moving averages can smooth a time series for an example with large random fluctuations. It initially only allows moving averages of odd numbers of values but can also show centred moving averages with even run lengths.</page>
<page dir='en/smoothing' filePrefix='l_smoothing2'>In this diagram, one value in the time series can be dragged to turn it into an outlier. The diagram shows the effect of the outlier on moving averages but shows that running medians are virtually unaffected.</page>
<page dir='en/smoothing' filePrefix='l_smoothing3'>This diagram illustrates the use of low-order running medians to remove the effect of outliers followed by moving averages for greater smoothness. One value can be dragged to turn it into an outlier.</page>
<page dir='en/smoothing' filePrefix='l_smoothing4'>This diagram illustrates exponential smoothing and shows that it gives smooth values up to the end of the series. However a different example shows that it systematically underestimates the values when there is an upward trend.</page>
<page dir='en/smoothing' filePrefix='l_smoothing5'>This diagram explains lowess smoothing for time series. Clicking on any cross shows the window of adjacent crosses, the least squares line fitted to them, and the smoothed value that is obtained as the least squares fitted value for the point. The window width can be adjusted for smoothness.</page>
<page dir='en/smoothing' filePrefix='l_smoothing6'>Although not about time series, this page illustrates the use of lowess to describe a nonlinear regression relationship.</page>
