<page dir="en/otherInfo" filePrefix="otherInfo1">The browser-based version of CAST makes extensive use of a Java plugin to display dynamic and interactive diagrams. A few browsers still support the Java plugin but many do not. We therefore recommend that you download CAST and start using the stand-alone version of CAST. (You will need to separately install Java support whichever version of CAST you use.)</page>
<page dir="en/otherInfo" filePrefix="otherInfo2">If an e-book has been written with summary versions of its pages, the summary pages in any chapter can be printed together.</page>
