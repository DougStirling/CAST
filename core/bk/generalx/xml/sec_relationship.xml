<page dir='en/relationship' filePrefix='l_relationship1'>In this diagram, the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables can be adjusted with a slider. Slices of the scatterplot can be highlighted to show how a strong relationship gives accurate predictions.</page>
<page dir='en/relationship' filePrefix='l_relationship2'>Two examples of scatterplots with outliers. In one example, the outlier is not unusual in either of the marginal distributions.</page>
<page dir='en/relationship' filePrefix='l_relationship3'>This diagram shows a scatterplot of two variables from Fisher's iris data in which two clusters are evident. The three varieties can then be shown with different colours.</page>
<page dir='en/relationship' filePrefix='l_relationship4'>This is a simulation showing that outliers and clusters can appear 'by chance' in scatterplots of small samples, even if the population has no such features.</page>
