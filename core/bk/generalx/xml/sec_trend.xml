<page dir='en/trend' filePrefix='l_trend1'>In this diagram, you can drag a line to describe linear trend in a time series and estimate its parameters by least squares. The diagram also shows that 'year' can be replaced by (year - xxx) to make the coefficients smaller.</page>
<page dir='en/trend' filePrefix='l_trend2'>This diagram is similar to the one above but allows a quadratic curve to be fitted to describe the trend..</page>
<page dir='en/trend' filePrefix='l_trend3'>In this diagram, a linear or quadratic model can be used to forecast into the future.</page>
<page dir='en/trend' filePrefix='l_trend4'>This diagram allows the degree to be increased of a least squares polynomial describing trend. It shows that high-degree polynomial models may smoothly describe nonlinear trend but that their forecasts are often wildly dependent on the polynomial degree.</page>
<page dir='en/trend' filePrefix='l_trend5'>The trend in a time series can be removed with a slider in this diagram, showing that the detrended values are simply the least squares residuals.</page>
