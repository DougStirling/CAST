<page dir='en/regnModel' filePrefix='l_regnModel1'>This is a 3-dimensional diagram that shows regression data with repeat measurements at each x as a histogram for each x. (It can be rotated.)</page>
<page dir='en/regnModel' filePrefix='l_regnModel2'>This 3-dimensional diagram shows a regression model as a normal pdf at each x. It can again be rotated to talk about linearity and constant variance.</page>
<page dir='en/regnModel' filePrefix='l_regnModel3'>This 3-d diagram generalises with a slider showing a normal pdf an any x-value.</page>
<page dir='en/regnModel' filePrefix='l_regnModel4'>This 3-d diagram displays a grey band 2sd on each side of the regression line and shows that about 95% of sampled values are within such a band.</page>
<page dir='en/regnModel' filePrefix='l_regnModel5'>This diagram is a scatterplot of a real data set with superimposed 95% band. The 3 model parameters can be adjusted (by dragging arrows on the band) to match the data reasonably well.</page>
