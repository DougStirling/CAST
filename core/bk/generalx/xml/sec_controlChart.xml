<page dir='en/controlChart' filePrefix='l_controlChart1'>An example run chart plots regular measurements from a process against time with control limits that were externally specified.</page>
<page dir='en/controlChart' filePrefix='l_controlChart2'>A diagram shows that almost all values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean for normal distributions. Control limits 3s on each side of the sample mean would therefore rarely be exceeded for data that are in control, provided they are not very skew.</page>
<page dir='en/controlChart' filePrefix='l_controlChart3'>Diagrams show other types of trigger for 'exceptional' points. An example is shown that includes several types of 'exceptional' point.</page>
<page dir='en/controlChart' filePrefix='l_controlChart4'>A simulation shows that false alarms occasionally happen even when the process is in control.</page>
<page dir='en/controlChart' filePrefix='l_controlChart5'>An example shows training data and further observations that occasionally go out of control.</page>
<page dir='en/controlChart' filePrefix='l_controlChart6'>A diagram shows a control chart for individual measurements from samples and also a control chart for the sample means.</page>
<page dir='en/controlChart' filePrefix='l_controlChart7'>A control chart for sample ranges is shown.</page>
<page dir='en/controlChart' filePrefix='l_controlChart8'>A diagram shows how a cause-and-effect diagram is drawn.</page>
