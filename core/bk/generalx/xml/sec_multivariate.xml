<page dir='en/multivariate' filePrefix='l_multivariate1'>This diagram shows a scatterplot of two variables in which the symbol used for each individual represents a third numerical variable.</page>
<page dir='en/multivariate' filePrefix='l_multivariate2'>This diagram shows a 3-dimensional scatterplot of three numerical variables that can be rotated by dragging with the mouse.</page>
<page dir='en/multivariate' filePrefix='l_multivariate3'>A scatterplot matrix contains scatterplots of every pair of variables in a data set. In this diagram, the scatterplots are dynamically linded so selecting crosses on one scatterplot by 'brushing' also selects the same individuals in all scatterplots.</page>
<page dir='en/multivariate' filePrefix='l_multivariate4'>This is a specialised example with 3 linked scatterplots -- one of temperature vs latitude, one of residuals vs latitude, and one of latitude vs longitude (i.e. a map of the locations of the cities). Brushing high residuals highlights the locations of cities that are unusually warm for their latitude.</page>
<page dir='en/multivariate' filePrefix='l_multivariate5'>This diagram illustrates how 'slices' of a data set can be selected with similar values of one variable. These slices can be dynamically displayed in a scatterplot of two other variables.</page>
