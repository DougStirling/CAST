<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='l_percentile1'>Diagram showing jittered dot plot and box plot where you can drag to highlight lower values and display the corresponding cumulative proportions.</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='l_percentile2'>A diagram similar to the previous one but also displaying the cumulative distribution function and showing how the cumulative proportions correspond to the height of this.</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='l_percentile3'>Diagram that also shows the cumulative distribution function but where you drag the percentage arrow and read off the corresponding percentile.</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='l_percentile4'>This diagram shows how the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles correspond to the central box of a box plot. These percentages can be changed (by dragging) and also displayed with the extremes in display that is related to a box plot.</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='l_percentile5'>In this diagram, quantiles are used to compare several groups graphically.</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='l_percentile6'>This diagram explains that the percentiles reported by computer software correspond to reading off quantiles from a smoothed version of the cumulative distribution function.</page>
