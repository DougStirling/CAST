<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs1'>In this diagram, you can sketch a curve going close to the crosses on a scatterplot and use it to predict Y from X.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs2'>This diagram illustrates the meaning of the intercept and slope of a line.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs3'>This diagram shows a line on a scatterplot and illustrates how its equation can be used to predict Y from X.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs4'>On this scatterplot, you can click on crosses to display actual and fitted values and residuals.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs5'>This diagram shows all residuals from a potential model as vertical lines on a scatterplot and allows the regression line to be dragged to make the residuals 'small'.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs6'>The squared residuals are displayed as squares on a scatterplot and the regression line can be dragged to minimise their total area.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs7'>This example illustrates an outlier and its effect. (The data are from cities in the USA and the crosses are linked to a map of the country. From this, it is clear that one city's latitude has been mistyped.)</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs8'>This diagram shows a residual plot that is linked to a scatterplot of the raw data. Curvature is clearer in the residual plot.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='l_leastSqrs9'>This diagram shows that minimising the resid ssq for predicting Y from X gives a different line from that for predicting X from Y. (A line can be dragged and both types of residual sum of squares are displayed to show that they are minimised by different lines.)</page>
