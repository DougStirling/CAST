<page dir='en/decision' filePrefix='l_decision1'>A diagram allows the critical value for a decision rule to be adjusted and shows how the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors are affected -- increasing one decreases the other. The significance level is explained as the probability of a Type I error for the decision rule.</page>
<page dir='en/decision' filePrefix='l_decision2'>This diagram shows that the cut-off for a decision rule can be based on the p-value for the corresponding test of the hypotheses.</page>
<page dir='en/decision' filePrefix='l_decision3'>In this diagram, the sample size can be increased with a slider. The resulting increase in the power is shown if the significance level is kept constant.</page>
