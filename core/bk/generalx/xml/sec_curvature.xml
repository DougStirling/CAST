<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='l_curvature1'>Two example are shown with nonlinear relationships. In both cases, transformation of X and/or Y (by dragging) linearises the relationship and the resulting correlation coefficient is a better description of the strength of the relationship.</page>
<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='l_curvature2'>This diagram shows that a linear model fitted to transformed variables is equivalent to a fitted curve on a scatterplot of the original variables.</page>
<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='l_curvature3'>This diagram shows the flexibility of a quadratic model -- three points can be dragged to position the curve. It also shows how least squares can be used to estimate the parameters.</page>
<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='l_curvature4'>This example shows how fitting a quadratic model can result in smaller residuals than a linear model if there is curvature.</page>
<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='l_curvature5'>In this diagram, two alternative nonlinear models are fitted to a scatterplot. Although they are hardly distinguishable within the range of the data, a slider expands the axis showing very different behaviours. This is a warning not to extrapolate beyond the data.</page>
