<page dir='en/designIntro' filePrefix='l_designIntro1'>This diagram illustrates that the experimental units can vary and shows that their varying characteristics can affect the response, even if there are no treatments.</page>
<page dir='en/designIntro' filePrefix='l_designIntro2'>This simulation shows that bad allocation of treatments to experimental units can bias estimates of treatment effects.</page>
<page dir='en/designIntro' filePrefix='l_designIntro3'>This simulation is similar to the previous one but randomly allocates treatments and therefore gives an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect.</page>
<page dir='en/designIntro' filePrefix='l_designIntro4'>These two diagrams give different methods to randomise allocation of treatments to experimental units.</page>
<page dir='en/designIntro' filePrefix='l_designIntro5'>A few static diagrams show that it is impossible to assess differences between treatments if there is only a single replicate but replication estimates unexplained variability, helping us to assess treatment differences.</page>
<page dir='en/designIntro' filePrefix='l_designIntro6'>This diagram illustrates the randomisation involved in a randomised block design.</page>
<page dir='en/designIntro' filePrefix='l_designIntro7'>This simulation shows that a randomised block design gives more accurate estimates of treatment effects than a completely randomised design.</page>
