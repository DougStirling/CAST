<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity1'>This diagram shows a bar chart of a finite categorical population. Clicking any bar labels it with the probability that a single sampled value is that category -- i.e. the bar height.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity2'>This diagram illustrates that the population proportion of values in a range equals the probability for a single value. A range of values on the population dot plot can be highlighted and is labeled both as a proportion and probability.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity3'>In this diagram, the sample size can be increased, showing that a sample proportion tends to a limit (the probability) as the sample size increases.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity4'>This simulation shows how a bar chart becomes more stable when the sample size increases. The limiting bar chart gives the population probabilities.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity5'>A simulation shows how a histogram becomes more stable and smoother when the sample size increases and classes are made narrower. The limiting histogram is called a probability density function.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity6'>This diagram show a normal pdf with sliders to adjust the mean and sd. (The area remains constant.)</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity7'>This diagram shows the histogram of a real data set for which a normal distribution is a reasonable model. The parameters of the superimposed normal pdf can be adjusted to match the histogram shape.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity8'>This diagram allows you to drag over the classes in a histogram or the possible values in a pdf. It illustrates that area equals probability.</page>
