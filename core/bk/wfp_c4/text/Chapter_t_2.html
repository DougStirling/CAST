<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Time Series</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Multiplicative models</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Additive and multiplicative models</h3>
<p>In some time series, the different components affect the data multiplicatively rather than additively. If the data are replaced by their logs, a multiplicative model becomes additive.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Properties of multiplicative models</h3>
<p>In a multiplicative model, the seasonal pattern has greater amplitude when the trend is higher.</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Forecasting with multiplicative models</h3>
<p>A multiplicative model is fitted by using an additive model with the log data. The resulting forecasts are also of the log data, and so must be back-transformed to give a forecast in the original units.</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Analysing the right data</h3>
<p>Many types of data should be modified before attempting to interpret them in a time series plot. Seasonal adjustment, transforming to constant dollars and use of per capita data are examples.</p>
<h3>2.1.5 &nbsp; Types of time series data</h3>
<p>Time series can describe processes that are discrete or continuous, and the measurements of continuous processes can be aggregates or snap-shots. The values can also be either discrete or continuous.</p>
