<p class="heading">Additive models</p>
	<p>We  assumed earlier that the four time series
		components affect it additively.</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue" style="font-weight:bold">Deseasonalised&nbsp; = &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; + &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; + &nbsp; Residual</span> </p>
	<p>This implies that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The difference between the 
		January and July values is approximately the same each year.</li>
		<li>The residuals are roughly the same sizes 
		throughout the series.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The seasonal pattern has greater magnitude at
the end of the following time series than at its start, so an additive model
is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/multiplicative/images/s_seasonalData.gif" width="468" height="253"></p>
	<p class="heading">Multiplicative models</p>
	<p>In many time series, the absolute differences in the values are of less interest
and importance than the percentage changes. A <strong>multiplicative
model</strong> assumes that seasonal and other effects act proportionally on
the series:</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong>Data &nbsp; = &nbsp; (Seasonal effect) &nbsp; &times; &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; &times; &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; &times; &nbsp; Residual</strong></span> </p>
	<p>After taking logarithms (either natural logarithms or to base 10), the four 
	components of the time series again act additively.</p>
	<table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="color:#009; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<tr>
<td valign="top" rowspan="2"><strong>log(Data) &nbsp;</strong></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><strong>= &nbsp; log(Seasonal effect &nbsp; × &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; × &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; × &nbsp; Residual)</strong></td>
</tr>

<h2 class="pageName">2.1.2 &nbsp; Properties of multiplicative models</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Difference between additive and multiplicative models</p>
	<p>Additive and multiplicative models can only be easily distinguished when 
		there is noticeable trend in the time series.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Additive model</dt>
		<dd>For this model, the seasonal, cyclical and residual variation around the
trend line are of approximately the same size whether the trend value is low or
high.</dd>

around the trend line are greater when the trend is at high values than when
the trend is low.</dd>

<h2 class="pageName">2.1.3 &nbsp; Forecasting with multiplicative models</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Obtaining forecasts</p>
	<p>A multiplicative model is equivalent to an additive model for the 
		log data.</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong>log(Data) &nbsp; = &nbsp; Seasonal* &nbsp; + &nbsp; Trend* &nbsp; + &nbsp; Cyclical* &nbsp; + &nbsp; Residual</strong>*</span></p>
	<p>This model 
		will give forecasts of the <strong>log data</strong>.</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong>forecast of log(Data) &nbsp; = &nbsp; (forecast Seasonal*) &nbsp;+ &nbsp;(forecast Trend*) &nbsp;+ &nbsp;(forecast Cyclical*)</strong></span></p>
	<p>To obtain forecasts in the original scale, an inverse transformation must 
		be applied. With base-10 logarithms,</p>
	<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="centred" style="color:#009;margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2"><strong>forecast of Data &nbsp; = &nbsp; 10</strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size:90%">forecast of log(Data)</span></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>(If natural logarithms were used, an exponential function gives a forecast in the original units. Both  types of logarithms result in identical forecasts.)</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.1.4 &nbsp; Analysing the right data</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>Analysis of 
			the raw data can sometimes lead you to wrong conclusions. Adjustment of the 
			data prior to analysis may give you better insight.</p>
	<p class="heading">Seasonally adjusting data</p>
	<p>Data should be <strong>seasonally adjusted</strong> to remove any seasonal pattern before you try to interpret whether any particular value is unusually high or low.</p>
	<p class="heading">Adjusting to constant dollars</p>
	<p>A 1990 dollar 
		was worth considerably more than a 2010 dollar, making it hard to compare prices in these two years.</p>
	<p>Values described in dollars should be adjusted to 'constant' dollars using the consumer price index (CPI) or the price of some other 'standard' commodity. Using  average income to adjust 
		house prices to '1990 dollars',</p>

	<p class="heading">Using per capita data</p>
	<p>Looking at trends in 'quantity' values (e.g. a country's total alcohol consumption) is misleading over a period in which the population  increases. It is more meaningful to examine quantities <strong>per person</strong>.</p>
	
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Always consider carefully whether a different variable would describe the
data more meaningfully.</p>

		<dt><strong>Regular snapshots of a continuous process</strong></dt>
		<dt><strong>Quantities that are aggregated over a period</strong></dt>
