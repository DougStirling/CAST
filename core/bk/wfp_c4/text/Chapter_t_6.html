<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Designed Experiments</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Principles of experimental design</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Experiments and treatments</h3>
<p>Experiments are conducted to assess the effect of some categorical or numerical explanatory variable on a response. Experiments are characterised by the fact that the researcher can control the values of the explanatory variable that are used.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Variable experimental units</h3>
<p>In many experiments, the units on which the experiment is conducted are not identical. The varying characteristics of the experimental units may affect the response.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; A badly designed experiment</h3>
<p>If the treatments are badly allocated to experimental units, the experiment may over- or under-estimate their effect.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Confounding</h3>
<p>If the experimental units that are chosen to get one treatment also differ in other ways, it will be impossible to tell whether it is the treatment or the other distinct characteristics of the units that affects the response.</p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; Randomisation</h3>
<p>Random allocation of treatments to experimental units avoids systematic over- or under-estimation of treatment effects.</p>
<h3>6.1.6 &nbsp; Replication</h3>
<p>If each treatment is used in more than one experimental unit, unit-to-unit variability can be assessed. This gives information about whether differences between the treatments are more than chance differences.</p>
<h3>6.1.7 &nbsp; Blocking</h3>
<p>By grouping similar experimental units into blocks and randomly allocating treatments within blocks, the treatment effects can be estimated more accurately.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Pairing and blocks</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Aim of similar experimental units</h3>
<p>The effect of a factor is most accurately estimated in an experiment in which all experimental units are very similar. The more variability in the experimental units, the less accurate the estimates.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Experiment with matched pairs</h3>
<p>If the factor has two levels, it is sometimes possible to group the experimental units into pairs that are similar to each other. By allocating one experimental unit from each pair to each factor level, the factor effect is estimated more accurately than in a completely randomised experiment.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Randomisation in paired experiments</h3>
<p>It is critically important that the two treatment levels are randomly allocated to the two experimental units in each pair.</p>
<h3>6.2.4 &nbsp; Matched groups of 3 or more units</h3>
<p>The idea of matched pairs of experimental units can be generalised into matched groupes of 3 or more if the factor has 3 or more levels. Randomly allocating the factor levels within each matched group results in more accurate estimates than in a completely randomised design.</p>
<h3>6.2.5 &nbsp; Randomised block experiments</h3>
<p>In many experiments, the experimental units naturally occur in groups of similar units (called blocks) where the block size is a multiple of the number of factor levels. A randomised block experiment randomly allocates equal numbers of units to each factor level within each block.</p>
<h2>6.3 &nbsp; Two or more factors</h2>
<h3>6.3.1 &nbsp; Experiments with 2 factors</h3>
<p>A second factor can be varied in a randomised experiment for one factor without affecting the accuracy of the estimated effect of the first factor.</p>
<h3>6.3.2 &nbsp; Factorial design</h3>
<p>In a factorial experiment, each combination of the levels of two or more factors is used on the same number of experimental units.</p>
<h3>6.3.3 &nbsp; Simple model for two factors</h3>
<p>The simplest model for the effect of two factors assumes that the effect of each factor is the same, whatever the value of the other factor. The mean response can be written as the sum of the effects of the separate factors.</p>
<h3>6.3.4 &nbsp; Interaction between factors</h3>
<p>If the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other, there is said to be interaction between them. Interaction can be assessed from a factorial experiment.</p>
<h3>6.3.5 &nbsp; Example with interaction</h3>
<p>This example helps to explain the concept of interaction.</p>
<h3>6.3.6 &nbsp; No-interaction model for three factors</h3>
<p>The simplest model for three or more factors assumes that the effect of each does not depend on the levels of the others. The mean response is modelled as the sum of terms for the individual factors.</p>
<h3>6.3.7 &nbsp; Interaction in 3-factor designs</h3>
<p>In factorial experiments with 3 or more factors, there may be interactions between two or more of the factors.</p>
<h2>6.4 &nbsp; Practical issues in design</h2>
<h3>6.4.1 &nbsp; Purpose</h3>
<p>Why is the experiment being conducted and how will the results be used?</p>
<h3>6.4.2 &nbsp; Experimental units and measurements</h3>
<p>In an experiment, what experimental units will be used? What response variable will be recorded? Which variables will be controlled?</p>
<h3>6.4.3 &nbsp; Experiments with human subjects</h3>
<p>Other practical issues are involved when conducting experiments on human subjects.</p>
