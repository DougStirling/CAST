<p>When data are collected in a survey (an observational study), relationships 
between the variables may be observed, but it is difficult to conclude that either 
variable <strong>causally</strong> affects the other. On the other hand, data 
that are collected in well-designed experiments do give information about causal 
relationships.</p>
<p>Experiments are less common in business than in the sciences, so this version 
of CAST contains fewer sections about experimental design than the General or 
Biometric versions.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>To learn more about experimental design after studying this chapter, 
look at the General or Biometric versions of CAST.</p>
