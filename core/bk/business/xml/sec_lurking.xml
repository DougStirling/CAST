<page dir="en/lurking" filePrefix="lurking_c1" summaryDir="en/lurking" summaryFilePrefix="s_lurking1" videoDir="en/lurking" videoFilePrefix="v_lurking_c1">Variables Y and X may be positively correlated overall, but have zero or even negative correlation at each value of a categorical variable, Z. The variable Z is called a lurking (or hidden) variable.</page>
<page dir="en/lurking" filePrefix="lurking2" summaryDir="en/lurking" summaryFilePrefix="s_lurking2" videoDir="en/lurking" videoFilePrefix="v_lurking2">A lurking variable can also distort the difference between the means of Y in two groups (i.e. for two values of a categorical variable, X).</page>
<page dir="en/lurking" filePrefix="lurking_c3" summaryDir="en/lurking" summaryFilePrefix="s_lurking_c3" videoDir="en/lurking" videoFilePrefix="v_lurking_c3">If X, Y and Z are all categorical, a reversal of the marginal relationship between X and Y and their conditional relationships for different values of Z is called Simpson's paradox.</page>
<page dir="en/lurking" filePrefix="lurking4" summaryDir="en/lurking" summaryFilePrefix="s_lurking4" videoDir="en/lurking" videoFilePrefix="v_lurking4">A few extra examples are shown where a hidden variable, Z, can result in a misleading conclusion from the marginal relationship. A full analysis using Z is always more complex but is essential to understand the relationship.</page>
