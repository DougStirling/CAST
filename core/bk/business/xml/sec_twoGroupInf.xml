<page dir="en/twoGroupInf" filePrefix="twoGroupInf_c1" summaryDir="en/twoGroupInf" summaryFilePrefix="s_twoGroupInf1" videoDir="en/twoGroupInf" videoFilePrefix="v_twoGroupInf_c1">The difference between the means of two samples from normal populations has a normal distribution whose mean and s.d. can be found from the population means and s.d.s. This is the approximate distribution even when the populations are non-normal.</page>
<page dir="en/twoGroupInf" filePrefix="twoGroupInf_c2" summaryDir="en/twoGroupInf" summaryFilePrefix="s_twoGroupInf_c2" videoDir="en/twoGroupInf" videoFilePrefix="v_twoGroupInf_c2">When the difference between the sample means is used to estimate the difference between the underlying population means, there is likely to be an error. The error distribution is approximately normal with mean 0. A formula for its standard deviation is given.</page>
<page dir="en/twoGroupInf" filePrefix="twoGroupInf_c3" summaryDir="en/twoGroupInf" summaryFilePrefix="s_twoGroupInf_c3" videoDir="en/twoGroupInf" videoFilePrefix="v_twoGroupInf_c3">A 95% confidence interval is given for the difference between two population means. Its properties are demonstrated.</page>
