<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Graphical Summaries</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Graphical display of values</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Analysing variation</h3>
<p>Meaningful information can be obtained from variation in the values of a variable.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Basic dot plot</h3>
<p>A dot plot displays each value as a cross along a numerical axis.</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h3>
<p>Jittering is a modification to the basic dot plot that avoids some problems associated with overlapping crosses</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h3>
<p>Stacking of the crosses is an alternative to jittering that highlights ranges of high or low density.</p>
<h3>2.1.5 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>Stem and leaf plots are similar to stacked dot plots, but a digit is used instead of a cross to retain extra information.</p>
<h3>2.1.6 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h3>
<p>To increase the flexibility of the display, each stem may be repeated either 2 or 5 times, increasing the number of classes in the basic stem and leaf plot by a factor of 2 or 5.</p>
<h3>2.1.7 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>For data analysis, stem and leaf plots are rarely more informative than stacked dot plots, but they are easy to draw by hand.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Understanding distributions</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>Does the data contain any outliers -- values that are atypically large or small? The extreme values in a skew distribution are often mistaken for outliers.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>Does the data split into separate clusters -- ranges of values with high density separated by ranges with low density? Clusters may correspond to different groups of individuals.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h3>
<p>The distribution gives information about a typical value round which the data are spread (the distribution's location or centre) and the variability of the values (the spread of the distribution).</p>
<h3>2.2.4 &nbsp; Extra information about individuals</h3>
<p>Additional information about the items from which measurements have been made can help us understand the distribution of values in the data.</p>
<h3>2.2.5 &nbsp; Distinguishing known groups</h3>
<p>If we know that the values come from 2 or more groups of individuals, dot plots can be modified to show this extra information.</p>
<h3>2.2.6 &nbsp; Dangers of overinterpretation</h3>
<p>There is a risk of over-interpreting patterns in small data sets.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Histograms and density</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; Density of values</h3>
<p>The heights of the stacks of crosses in a dot plot describe the density of values.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h3>
<p>In a simple histogram, the height of the rectangle above each class on the axis equals the number of values in the class -- the class frequency.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h3>
<p>Class width and start-point should be chosen to make the histogram as smooth as possible -- neither too blocky nor too jagged.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h3>
<p>The shape of a histogram can be very dependent on the choice of classes if the data set is small; beware over-interpreting its shape. Stacked dot plots are a better display of small data sets.</p>
<h3>2.3.5 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h3>
<p>In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</p>
<h3>2.3.6 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h3>
<p>The vertical axis should be relative frequency, not frequency, when comparing two groups with histograms. Population pyramids are often used to compare age distributions.</p>
<h3>2.3.7 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h3>
<p>If a histogram has varying class widths, the vertical axis must be 'density'. The histogram shape would be misleading if frequency or relative frequency was used for the vertical axis.</p>
<h3>2.3.8 &nbsp; Understanding histograms</h3>
<p>The proportion of values in any classes always equals the proportion of the total histogram area that is above the classes.</p>
<h3>2.3.9 &nbsp; Frequency polygons</h3>
<p>Frequency polygons are closely related to histograms but give a less 'blocky' display of density. Different groups can be compared more easily with them.</p>
<h3>2.3.10 &nbsp; Kernel density estimates</h3>
<p>Kernel density estimates show density in a still smoother display.</p>
<h2>2.4 &nbsp; Discrete data (counts)</h2>
<h3>2.4.1 &nbsp; Discrete and continuous data</h3>
<p>Discrete data sets contain counts whereas continuous data sets could potentially contain any values within an interval. Stacked dot plots are good displays of small discrete data sets containing small counts.</p>
<h3>2.4.2 &nbsp; Histograms for counts</h3>
<p>When the range of possible counts is moderate or large, a histogram is an effective display of the distribution. Class width should be a whole number and class boundaries should end in '.5'.</p>
<h3>2.4.3 &nbsp; Bar charts</h3>
<p>When the range of possible counts is small, a bar chart is a better representation of the data than a histogram.</p>
<h2>2.5 &nbsp; Frequency tables</h2>
<h3>2.5.1 &nbsp; Frequency tables</h3>
<p>A frequency table holds all information about the distribution of a categorical variable.</p>
<h3>2.5.2 &nbsp; Proportions and percentages</h3>
<p>The proportions or percentages of values are usually easier to interpret than the raw frequencies.</p>
<h3>2.5.3 &nbsp; Recognising frequency tables</h3>
<p>In a frequency table, each 'individual' contributes a count (frequency) of 1 to exactly one table entry. Many published tables of counts and percentages are not proper frequency tables.</p>
<h3>2.5.4 &nbsp; Changes to the categories</h3>
<p>The information in a frequency table may be clearer if the categories are re-ordered, associated categories are combined, or if the table only describes a subset of the categories.</p>
<h2>2.6 &nbsp; Bar and pie charts</h2>
<h3>2.6.1 &nbsp; Bar charts</h3>
<p>A bar chart displays the frequencies in a frequency table graphically.</p>
<h3>2.6.2 &nbsp; Pareto diagrams</h3>
<p>For barcharts of categorical data whose categories have no natural ordering, it is often helpful to sort the categories into decreasing frequencies.</p>
<h3>2.6.3 &nbsp; Chartjunk and misleading bar charts</h3>
<p>The temptation to embellish simple barcharts should be resisted. Some such 'artistic' embellishments are misleading.</p>
<h3>2.6.4 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts and pie charts</h3>
<p>These are alternatives to a bar chart for categorical data.</p>
<h3>2.6.5 &nbsp; Comparison of bar and pie charts</h3>
<p>Bar charts distinguish better the proportions in single categories. Pie charts are better for showing the proportion in a group of categories.</p>
<h3>2.6.6 &nbsp; Chartjunk for pie charts</h3>
<p>Three-dimensional pie charts are often drawn. If a pie chart holds little information, it is better to draw it small than to enhance it in this way.</p>
<h3>2.6.7 &nbsp; Bar and pie charts for quantities</h3>
<p>Bar and pie charts can be used to display any data where a total quantity is split into parts.</p>
