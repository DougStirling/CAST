<h1>Chapter 8 &nbsp; Probability</h1>
<h2>8.1 &nbsp; Simulation (optional)</h2>
<h3>8.1.1 &nbsp; Probability models and simulation</h3>
<p>Probability can be used to model complex situations. A simulation of the model involves using the model's probabilities to generate an instance of the situation. Repeating the simulation can give insight into the behaviour of the system.</p>
<h3>8.1.2 &nbsp; Simulation: Will the best team win?</h3>
<p>A simulation demonstrates that the best team is often not top of a league at the end of the season even if it has a much higher probability of winning individual matches than all other teams.</p>
<h3>8.1.3 &nbsp; Is there evidence of skill in a league?</h3>
<p>A simulation of a soccer league shows that the spread of points at the end of an actual soccer season is not consistent with all teams having equal abilities.</p>
<h3>8.1.4 &nbsp; Assessing unusual features in data</h3>
<p>The variability of displays from 'regular' populations (such as normal distributions) can be used to assess features in a single data set, such as outliers, clusters or skewness.</p>
<h3>8.1.5 &nbsp; Random numbers</h3>
<p>Simulations are based on randomly generated values. These are generally based on random numbers for which any value between 0 and 1 is equally likely.</p>
<h3>8.1.6 &nbsp; Generating categorical values</h3>
<p>A random categorical value can be easily generated from a random number between 0 and 1.</p>
<h3>8.1.7 &nbsp; Generating numerical values</h3>
<p>Generating random numerical values from a particular distribution is harder. This page describes one such method.</p>
<h2>8.2 &nbsp; Probability and applications</h2>
<h3>8.2.1 &nbsp; Joint probabilities</h3>
<p>Bivariate categorical data are modelled as a sample from a population that consists of pairs of categorical values. The joint probability for any pair of categories is their population proportion.</p>
<h3>8.2.2 &nbsp; Marginal probabilities</h3>
<p>The marginal probabilities for a variable are the population proportions for its possible values. They can be found by summing joint probabilities.</p>
<h3>8.2.3 &nbsp; Conditional probabilities</h3>
<p>Conditional probabilites for a variable are proportions in a sub-population containing a specific value for the other variable. They are found by scaling the joint probabilities in that sub-population.</p>
<h3>8.2.4 &nbsp; Graphical display of probabilities</h3>
<p>Joint, marginal and conditional probabilities can be displayed graphically.</p>
<h3>8.2.5 &nbsp; Calculations with probabilities</h3>
<p>The model can be equivalently described by (a) joint probabilities, (b) marginal probabilites for X and conditional probabilities for Y, or (c) marginal probabilites for Y and conditional probabilities for X. Any of these sets of probabilities can be found any other set.</p>
