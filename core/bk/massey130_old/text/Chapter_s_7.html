<p class="heading notPrinted">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>We are often interested in relationships between variables. The correlation between two numerical variables summarises their relationship; a contingency table  contains information about the relationship between two categorical variables.</p>
<p>When the individuals can be split into groups, a categorical variable can
be used to define group membership. Differences between the groups can then be
expressed as a relationship between the grouping variable and other variables.
The following questions are essentially asking the same in two different ways:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Do boys and girls aged 14 perform the same at maths?</dt>
	<dt>Is there a relationship between gender and mark in a maths test?</dt>
</dl>
<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
	evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">7.2.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Is a relationship causal?</p>
	<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
		the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
		adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change.</p>
	<p>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
	collected. <strong>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</strong></p>
	<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
	<p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables called <strong>lurking variables</strong> that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
  it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.2.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Individuals / units</p>
	<p>Most data sets consist of one or more values that are recorded from each of 
		a set of <strong>individuals</strong> (or plants, plots of land, repetitions of an experiment or 
		other 'units'). There are two different ways in which data can be collected from these units.</p>
<p class="heading">Types of data collection</p>
	<p>In an <strong>observational study</strong>, we passively 
		record (observe) values from each unit. Usually these units are sampled from some population.</p>
	<p>In an <strong>experiment</strong>, the researcher actively changes some characteristics 
		of the units before the data are collected. The values of some variables are therefore <strong>under the control of the experimenter</strong>. In other words, the experimenter 
		is able to <strong>choose</strong> each individual's values for some variables.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.2.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>

<p class="heading">Population and census</p>
	<p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
		fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
		group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
	<p>Collecting measurements  from every item in the  population is called a <strong>census</strong>. A census is rarely feasible,  because of the  cost and time involved.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
	<p>We can usually obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
	collecting information from a selection of units from the population &mdash; a <strong>sample</strong>. Although a sample gives less accurate information than a census, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample  is  
		a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In it, each unit has the same chance 
		of being selected and some random mechanism is used to determine whether any particular unit is 
		included in the sample.	</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	<p>It is convenient 
		to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
		than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
		corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>

<p class="heading">Different sampling schemes</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Sampling with replacement (SWR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWR, the first selected value is <strong>returned to the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from all <i>N</i> population values. </dd>

		<dd>In SWOR, the first selected value is <strong>removed from the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from the remaining <i>N</i> - 1 population 
		values, etc.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Since a SWR may contain the same population value more than once, it covers less of the population than SWOR. SWOR therefore gives more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Large populations and/or small samples</p>
	<p>If the sample size, <i>n</i>, is much smaller than the population size, <i>N</i>, 
		there is little practical difference between SWR and SWOR &mdash; there would be little

<h2 class="pageName">7.4.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>A simple random sample of individuals from a population is the easiest sampling scheme to understand, but other sampling schemes may give more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Grouping of individuals</p>
	<p>If the individuals in the population can be split into different groups (called <strong>strata</strong> in sampling terminology), it is often better to take a 
		simple random sample <strong>within each separate group</strong> than to sample 
		randomly from the whole population. This is called a <strong>stratified random 
			sample</strong>.</p>
	<p>The  proportion sampled from the different strata are usually fixed to be the same as the proportions of individuals in the strata in the population. In a simple random sample, the proportions sampled from the strata might not match the population proportions, so a stratified random sample should be more 'representative'.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/sampPractice/images/s_stratified.gif" width="418" height="351"> </p>
	<p>The benefits from stratified random sampling are greatest if the measurement 
		being sampled is different in the different strata.</p>
	<p class="heading">Groups with different variability (advanced)</p>
	<p>In stratified random samples, random samples are usually taken from the different 
		strata in proportion to the number of population values in the strata.</p>
	<p>This proportionality is not however essential, and greater accuracy can be 
		obtained by selecting larger samples from strata with greater variability. However 
		if sample size is not proportional to stratum size, the overall sample mean is 
		no longer appropriate for estimating the overall population mean.</p>
	<p>If there are <em>k</em> strata of size <em>N</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>N</em><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<em>N<sub>k</sub></em>, 
		and samples of size <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<em>n<sub>k</sub></em> are taken from the strata, giving means <img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub>1</sub></span>, <img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub>2</sub></span>, ..., <img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub><em>k</em></sub></span> , then the population mean should be estimated by</p>

<h2 class="pageName">7.4.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling frame</p>
	<p>Before taking a simple random sample or stratified random sample, a complete 
		list of all individuals in the target population must be available. This is called a <strong>sampling 
			frame</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
	<p>If a complete sampling frame is not available, it may be possible to group the target individuals into reasonably 
	small groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>, for which a complete list is available.</p>
	<p>Clusters are similar to the strata that are used for stratified sampling, but 
		are usually much smaller. For example, a cluster might contain all of the houses in a street, or all of the individuals in a household. It is not necessary to know beforehand how many individuals are in each of the clusters.</p>
	<p>For cluster sampling, a <strong>simple random sample of clusters</strong> is 
		selected, with all individuals in these clusters selected.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cost advantages</p>
	<p>Even when a complete sampling frame is available, cluster sampling might be 
		used to reduce the cost of sampling (or to increase the sample size for the same 
		cost) since it is often cheaper to record information from individuals in the 
		same cluster than from different parts of the sampling frame.</p>
	<p class="heading">Accuracy of cluster sampling</p>
	<p>The disadvantage of cluster sampling is that estimates are usually less accurate than the corresponding estimates from 
	a simple random sample of the same size.</p>
	<p>However the cost advantages would permit a larger sample size, so cluster sampling may give the best estimates <strong>for a fixed cost</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.4.3 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Estimation</p>
	<p>The aim of sampling is usually to <strong>estimate</strong> one or more population 
		values (parameters) from a sample. Because we do not have complete information about the population, the estimate is unlikely to be <strong>exactly</strong> same as the value that we are estimating, 
		so we call the difference the <strong>error</strong> in the estimate. There are 
		different kinds of error.</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling error</p>
	<p>We have presented four different ways to sample from a population</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Simple random sample</li>
		<li>Stratified sample</li>
		<li>Cluster sample</li>
		<li>Two-stage sample</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each of these involves randomness in the sample-selection process. The error caused by randomness in the sampling process is called <strong>sampling 
			error</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Non-sampling error</p>
	<p>When sampling from some types of population &mdash; especially human populations 
		&mdash; problems often arise when conducting one of the above sampling schemes. For 
		example, some sampled people are likely to refuse to participate in your study.</p>
	<p>Such difficulties also result in errors and these are called <strong>non-sampling 
		errors</strong>. Non-sampling errors can be much higher than sampling errors 
		and are much more serious. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike sampling errors, the likely size of non-sampling errors cannot be estimated 
			from a single sample &mdash; it is extremely difficult to assess their likely size.</li>
		<li>Non-sampling errors often distort estimates by pulling them in one direction. 
			The estimates are then called <strong>biased</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is therefore important to design a survey to minimise the risk of non-sampling 
		errors.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.4.4 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
	<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
		from some members of the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>
	<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
		the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
		the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
		only a subgroup of it.</p>
	<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>
	<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Failure to contact the individuals.</li>
		<li>Refusal to participate in the study.</li>
		<li>Refusal to answer particular questions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
		survey are likely to be biased.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.4.5 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>'Inaccurate' responses</p>
	<p>The next two types of non-sampling error are caused by inaccurate information 
		being obtained from the sampled individuals.</p>
	<p class=heading>Instrument error</p>
	<p><strong>Instrument error</strong> usually results from poorly designed
		questions. Different wording of questions can lead to different answers being 
		given by a respondent. The wording of the question may be such as to elicit some
		particular response (a <strong>leading</strong> question) or it may simply be carelessly
		worded so that it is misinterpreted by some respondents. </p>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer error</p>
	<p><strong>Interviewer error</strong> occurs when some characteristic of the interviewer, such
		as age or sex, affects the way in which respondents answer questions.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.4.6 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>There are various different ways to collect information from human populations. 
	Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
	<p class=heading>Telephone</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response can be high.</li>
		<li>Coverage error is small.</li>
		<li>The number of questions must be kept very small.</li>
		<li>Inexpensive, so sample sizes can be greater.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Mailed questionnaire</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response is very high.</li>
		<li>Costs are higher than in a telephone survey.</li>
		<li>Mailed questionnaires can contain more questions than telephone surveys.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lowest non-response and other sampling errors.</li>
		<li>Interviewers must be well trained to reduce interviewer error.</li>
		<li>Most expensive.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires can be fairly long.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Houses are rarely selected at random. Often streets are randomly selected and every
		5th or 10th house in the street is approached. This is called a <strong>systematic
			sample</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Street corner</p>
	<p>Some surveys are conducted by approaching people in busy shopping centres or
		similar public places. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Large coverage errors.</li>
		<li>Least expensive and therefore widely used.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires must be small.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To reduce coverage errors, a <strong>quota sample</strong> is often used. Each 
		interviewer is told to interview fixed numbers of old, young, male, female, etc. 
		respondents to match the 
		corresponding proportion in the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Self-selected</p>
	<p>Phone-in or mail-in surveys are often conducted by radio stations and magazines. The
		respondents are usually so unrepresentative that the results are meaningless. These types
		of survey should be avoided. </p>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
	<p>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
	one or more explanatory variables.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
	<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
		Depending on the type of experiment, these units could be people, animals, trees, areas in a field, shops in a retail chain, ...</p>
	<p>In the experiments that we will examine here, a single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.</p>
	<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
	<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit. These controlled characteristics are  explanatory variables and are called <strong>factors</strong> in the context of an experiment. The different values 
		of the controlled characteristics are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>
	<p>The decision about which  treatment is applied to 
				each experimental unit is called the <strong>experimental 
	design</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="pageName">7.5.2 &nbsp; Variable experimental units</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Differences between experimental units</p>
	<p>In practice, it is usually impossible to conduct experiments with experimental units that are identical. The experimental units usually  have 
  characteristics that vary from unit to unit.</p>
	<p>These differences between the experimental units result in variability in the response measurements that are made from them, even if all receive the same treatment.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.5.3 &nbsp; A badly designed experiment</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Bad experimental design</p>
	<p>If the treatments are allocated to experimental units in a way that is associated with their naturally varying characteristics, the apparent relationship between the treatments and the response can be distorted.</p>

	<p class="heading">Good experimental design</p>
	<p>Since variability in the experimental units is usually unavoidable, we cannot 
		prevent their effect on the response. However  it is possible 
		to allocate treatments to the  units in a way that either eliminates, 
		or at least reduces, the relationship between the treatment, <em>X</em>, and 
		characteristics of the experimental units. </p>

<h2 class="pageName">7.5.4 &nbsp; Confounding</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Confounding</p>
	<p>The design of an experiment may make it <strong>impossible</strong> to 
		disentangle the effects of the treatment and other characteristics of the experimental uits. If the treatment is perfectly correlated with another 
		variable, the effects of the two variables <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished. 
	The treatment and variable are then said to be <strong>confounded</strong>.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>It is particularly important to avoid confounding in an experiment.</p></div></div>
	<p>In an experiment, <em>treatment A</em> was applied to 10 experimental units in 2010 and <em>treatment B</em> was used on 10 similar units in 2011.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_confounded.gif" width="340" height="134"></p>
	<p>It is <strong>impossible</strong> to tell whether the higher mean response for <em>treatment A</em> than <em>treatment B</em> was caused by the different treatments or other differences between the two years.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.5.5 &nbsp; Randomisation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Avoiding lurking variables</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>An important goal of experimental design is to minimise association 
	between allocation of the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units.</p></div></div>
	<p>If the varying characteristics of the experimental units are understood and measured before the experiment is conducted, treatments can be allocated to ensure that there is no association. (See the later page about <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('designIntro7')">blocking in experiments</a>.)</p>
	<p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
	<p>When the differing characteristics of the experimental units are unmeasured, 
		 association between them and the treatments can be minimised by randomly 
		allocating treatments to the experimental units. This is called <strong>randomisation</strong> of the treatments and the experimental design is called a <strong>completely randomised 
			design</strong>. </p>
	<p>Randomisation does not <strong>guarantee</strong> that there will be no association

		there may be some association. However...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Randomisation means that is unlikely that such lurking

</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Mechanics of randomisation</p>
	<p>The simplest way to randomise allocation of treatments to the experimental units is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Number the available experimental units from 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Find a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Allocate the treatments in order to the unit numbers given by the permutation.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Finding the random permutation is fairly easy in a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write the numbers 1 to <em>n</em> in a spreadsheet column</li>
		<li>Generate random numbers in an adjacent column &mdash; in Excel, type &quot;=RAND()&quot; in each cell.</li>
		<li>Select the two columns and use a menu command to sort the rows into ascending order of the random numbers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This gives a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</p>

<p class="heading">Causes of variation</p>

<p class="heading">Known differences between the experimental units</p>

<h2 class="pageName">7.6.1 &nbsp; Purpose</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">What is the purpose of the experiment?</p>
	<p>Before conducting an experiment it is important to clearly state its objectives.  In defining the goals of the experiment, it is 
		important that people with intimate knowledge of the process or subject area are 
	included in the team which is charged with designing and running the experiment. </p>
<p>Quite frequently,... </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A clear statement of the problem can lead to process improvement without 
				any experimentation, simply through creating a greater understanding of the process.</p>
</div></div>





<h2 class="pageName">7.6.2 &nbsp; Experimental units and measurements</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>What experimental units should be used?</p>
	<p>It is desirable for experimental units to be as similar as possible, so every
		attempt should be made to make the experimental units homogeneous.	</p>
	<p>Often however, the experimenter has little influence on the choice of experimental 
		units and must contend with whatever variability exists. Grouping them into block of similar units (and using a randomised block design) will make the results more accurate.</p>
	<p class="heading">What response variable should be recorded?</p>
	<p>In an experiment, there is sometimes a single obvious response measurement 
		from an experimental unit, but often there are several variables which can be considered 
		as response measurements.</p>
<p>A subject expert would need to decide on which 
		was most relevant to the aims of the experiment.</p>
	<p class=heading> Controlled variables</p>
	<p>Thought also needs to be given to which variables need to be controlled
		(the input variables) and what settings should be used for these variables
		in different experimental runs.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.6.3 &nbsp; Experiments with human subjects</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Ethical issues arise</p>
	<p>There are a few practicalities that complicate experimentation with human subjects.
		For ethical reasons, experiments involving potential danger to the subjects are not
		possible. Even if there is no known danger, the subjects should be aware of what is
		involved in the experiment and must give informed consent. </p>
	<p class=heading> Controls</p>
	<p>Treatments that involve change  should usually be compared to a  'treatment' in which there is no change. Individuals for whom there has been no change are called <strong>controls</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading> Placebos</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the act of administering a treatment to a human subject may itself
		affect the response, irrespective of the treatment effect. For example, if a drug
		is being assessed for its ability to reduce headaches, the knowledge that medication
		has been administered may make the subject feel better, even if the drug has no active
		ingredient. </p>
	<p>To avoid the psychological effect of the treatment on the subject being confounded 
		with the effect of the drug, an indistinguishable 'treatment' with no effect may 
		be given to the control group of subjects; this is called a <strong>placebo</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading> Double-blind experiments</p>
	<p>A further complication may arise when the measured response from each subject
		may be affected by knowledge of the treatment applied. If the experimenter knows
		which treatment has been applied to each experimental unit, there may be a
		subconscious tendency to systematically over- or under-assess one treatment.</p>
	<p>In a <strong>double-blind</strong> experiment, neither the experimenter 
		not the subject knows which treatment has been applied. Again, the aim is to ensure that other factors 
		do not act as lurking variables to confound comparisons of the treatments.</p>
