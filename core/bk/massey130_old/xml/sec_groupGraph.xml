<section name='Bar charts to compare groups'>

<page dir='bk/massey130_old' filePrefix='groupGraph1'>Tables of grouped data are often displayed graphically with bar charts. Bar charts of proportions within groups are usually easier to compare than bar charts of the raw values.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph3'>The bars can be clustered together by group or by category.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph4'>If there are many groups, stacking the bars often makes it easier to compare the groups.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph5'>If there are only two categories in each group, there is no need to present both proportions. A simple bar chart of one proportion is sufficient and allows the scale to be expanded if the proportion is small for all groups.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph6'>Three-dimensional versions of clustered and stacked bar charts make it harder to understand the data and can be misleading.</page>
