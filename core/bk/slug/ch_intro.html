<p class="heading">The Data</p>

<p>Simple least squares and linear regression are useful tools when a response 
	variable (e.g. hardness of concrete) is linearly related to an explanatory 
	variable (e.g. curing temperature). In such linear relationships, the crosses 
	in a scatterplot are scattered round a straight line. If the crosses in a 
	scatterplot follow a curve, the relationship is called <strong>nonlinear</strong> 
	and these methods are no longer appropriate.</p>
  <p>We approach the topic of nonlinear regression through a data set that was 
	used by Harold Henderson and Neil Cox at the Ruakura Research Centre of AgResearch 
	in Hamilton, New Zealand to teach nonlinear regression. The sequence of models 
	that is used here is based on their analysis of the data.</p>

<br><i>Limax maximus:</i> A, lateral aspect;  B, dorsal aspect
</p>

<p>Over a period of 4 years, 100 slugs of the species Limax maximus
were collected by two Ruakura researchers, Gary Barker and Rosemary
McGhie by regular sampling of a population living under a macrocarpa hedge in Hamilton
(NZ Entomologist, 8, 1984, 106-111). The slugs were preserved
in a relaxed state and subsequently their weight (gm) and length (cm) recorded.
Growth occurs throughout the year and there is a wide range of body size in any
given population. There is a seasonal reproductive cycle and slugs live for several
years. Greatest numbers of juvenile slugs occur from May to September.
