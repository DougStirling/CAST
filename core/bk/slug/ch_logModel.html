<p class="heading">Transforming Weight for Constant Variance </p>

<p>We previously transformed slug length to linearise the relationship. However 
	transforming an explanatory variable cannot fix problems with non-constant 
	variance. In order to obtain constant variance, the <strong>response</strong> 
	variable must be transformed.</p>
<p>(Section 1.8.3 of the <a href="javascript:openEbook('regn')">CAST e-book about regression</a> gives more detail about how transforming the response fixes the problem of non-constant variance.)</p>

  <p>We initially thought that slug weight might be proportional to (length)<sup>3</sup>. 
	This can be generalised and rewritten as follows:</p>

<p class=eqn>
<img src="images/logModel.gif" width="240" height="57" alt="log(wt) = log(a) + p log(len)">
</p>

  <p>If this model holds, log(wt) will be linearly related to log(len). Indeed, 
	this model will allow us to test whether the appropriate power is <i>p</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.</p>

<p><font color="#990000"><strong>We will use logarithms to the base 10 here since 
	they are slightly easier to understand for non-mathematicians, but natural 
	logarithms (base e) could be used everywhere instead. The main change would 
be in the labelling on the axes.</strong></font></p>
