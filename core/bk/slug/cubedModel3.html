<p class="heading">Confidence Intervals for Slope and Intercept
</p>

<p>Minitab gives a handle on the sample-to-sample variability of the
least squares coefficients (as estimates of the corresponding parameters for
slugs in general) in its regression output. The following output was generated
by Minitab with the <strong>Regression</strong> command where the response variable
was <i>weight</i> (a Minitab column with the 100 slug weights) and the explanatory
variable was <i>len3</i> (a Minitab column containing the 100 values of
(length)<img src="images/super3.gif" width="7" height="10" align="BASELINE">).

<p>The column titled 'Stdev' gives the standard deviation of the two
coefficients and therefore describes their accuracy. 95% confidence intervals
for the corresponding parameters describing 'slugs in general' are of the form
</p>

<p class=eqn>

</p>

<p>(If the number of data points, <i>n</i>, is small &mdash; say under 20 &mdash; you
should really use a slightly larger value from t-tables with (<i>n</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;2)
degrees of freedom instead of the constant '2'.)</p>

<p>95% confidence intervals for the two linear model parameters are therefore</p>

</p>

<p class="heading">Hypothesis Tests for parameters
</p>

<p>The Minitab output also provides a column of p-values associated with the
model parameters. These p-values describe whether the data are consistent with
the corresponding model parameter being zero.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Is the intercept zero?</b>
</dt>
<dd>The p-value for the constant term is 0.117, meaning that there would have
	been probability 0.117 of getting an intercept as far from zero as 0.1652
	even if the intercept for slugs in general was 0.0. Since this is fairly
	high, we conclude that the data are consistent with an intercept of zero.
	<br>This is reassuring since a model with zero intercept would predict a
	slug with length zero to also have weight zero!
</dd>

<dt><b>Is the slope zero?</b>
</dt>
    <dd>Minitab reports the p-value for (length)<img src="images/super3.gif" width="7" height="10" align="BASELINE"> 
	  to be '0.000' which really means 'under 0.0005', meaning that there would 
	  have been a probability below 0.0005 of getting a slope as far from zero 
	  as our least squares estimate of 0.0124 if the slope for slugs in general 
	  was 0.0. We therefore conclude that slug weight almost certainly <strong>is</strong> 
	  related to (length)<img src="images/super3.gif" width="7" height="10" align="BASELINE">. 
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>We could continue with this analysis by fitting a model without an intercept term,
an option when specifying a regression model in Minitab. However there are other
serious problems that mean a different approach is required.
