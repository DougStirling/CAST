<p class="heading">Implications About Shape of the Slugs
</p>

  <p>Our 95% confidence interval for the power does not include 3, suggesting that 
	weight is not proportional to (length)<img src="images/super3.gif" width="7" height="10" align="BASELINE">. 
	This implies that the <strong>shape</strong> of the slugs changes as they 
	get longer. To get a handle on this, we will assume that the weight of a slug 
	is proportional to its volume and that the slugs are cylindrical. Their weight 
	would then be proportional to</p>

<p class=eqn>
<img src="images/wtLenDiam.gif" width="304" height="24" alt="wt propn to len*diam2">
</p>

<p>Since we estimated weight to be proportional to length raised to the power 2.640,
</p>

<p class=eqn>
<img src="images/diamLen.gif" width="332" height="26" alt="diam propn to len**0.820">
</p>

<p>Slug diameter therefore seems to increase less than linearly with length &mdash; longer slugs
are relatively thinner.
</p>

<p class="heading">Testing Whether the Power is 3
</p>

<p>From the 95% confidence interval above, we have seen that there is evidence that slug
weight is not proportional to
(length)<img src="images/super3.gif" width="7" height="10" align="BASELINE">
but seems more likely to be proportional to
</p>

<p class=eqn>
<img src="images/proportional.gif" width="272" height="26" alt="len**2.540 to len**2.740">
</p>

<p>The 95% confidence interval for the power does not include 3, so we know that
the p-value is <&nbsp;0.05. However
Minitab does not automatically provide a p-value for this test. The p-value in the
Minitab output is
</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" class="centred">

</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This is for a test of whether the power is <strong>zero</strong> and we conclude
that there is extremely strong evidence that the power is not zero (and therefore that
slug weight is related to length in some way). To get a p-value to test whether the power is
<strong>3</strong>, we need a little more work.
</p>

<p>A t-ratio is first obtained by standardising the difference between the slope and 3.0 (i.e
we divide this difference by the standard deviation of the slope from the Minitab output).
</p>

<p class=eqn>
<img src="images/t3.gif" width="384" height="42" alt="t=(b1-3)/sd(b1)=-7.17">
</p>

<p>To assess whether this t-ratio is unusually far from zero, we compare its value to a
t-distribution with <i>n</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;97 degrees of freedom. In Minitab,
the probability of a t-ratio as low as -7.17 can be easily obtained by typing the 'CDF'
command in the Session window:
</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" class="centred">
	  <tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="font-family:monospace; text-align:left; font-size:10px">
MTB > CDF -7.17;<br>
SUBC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;97.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-7.1700&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.0000<br>
</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Minitab reports the probability of a t-ratio as low as -7.17 to be '0.0000'. 
Since a t-ratio as high as 7.17 would be equally odd, we should double this probability 
to get a p-value for the test (i.e. we should do a 2-tailed test). However the 
p-value is still extremely close to zero, so we conclude that there is extremely 
strong evidence that the power is less than 3 &mdash; slug weight is not related to 
(length)<sup>3</sup>.
