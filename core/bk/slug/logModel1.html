<p class="heading">Properties of logarithms </p>
<p>The most important properties of logarithmic functions are:</p>

<p class=eqn><img src="images/log1.gif" width="228" height="90">
</p>

<p>Multiplying any number <i>x</i> a constant adds the same value to its logarithm, whatever
the value of <i>x</i>. This changes multiplicative operations on the original values into
additive operations on the logarithms. For example,

<p class="heading">Logarithms to the Base 10
</p>

<p>There are various logarithmic functions, but the most common are logarithms <em>to
the base 10</em> and logarithms <em>to the base <i>e</i></em>. Logarithms to the base 10 are easiest
to understand, so we will start with them. The core property is:
</p>

<p class=eqn><img src="images/log3.gif" width="217" height="28">
</p>

<p>The logarithm of a number is therefore the power to which 10 must be raised to
generate that number. Important examples are:

</p>

<p class="heading">Logarithms to the Base e
</p>

<p>Logarithms to the base <i>e</i> (also called <strong>natural logarithms</strong>)
are similarly defined, but use a constant <i>e</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.71828 instead of 10.
Their defining property is therefore:
</p>

</p>

<p>For example,
</p>

</p>

<p class="heading">Relationship Between Logarithms to the Bases 10 and e
</p>

<p>Logarithms to the base <i>e</i> are more important than those to the base 10 in
mathematics. The reason for their importance cannot be
explained here, but they are simply related to logarithms to the base 10.
</p>

<p class=eqn><img src="images/log5.gif" width="393" height="23">
</p>

<p>Logarithms to the base <i>e</i> are therefore 2.3026 times those to the base 10.
In data analysis, using logarithms to a different base therefore simply rescales the data
-- graphical displays are unaffected if the labels on the axis are changed.
</p>

<p>In particular, changing the base of the logarithms does not affect linearity or the other
assumptions underlying linear models.
