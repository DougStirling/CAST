<p class="heading notPrinted">Information from the variation in data</p>
<p>Variation in data is not simply an annoyance &mdash; the variation itself can 
		hold important information.</p>
<p>Simply sorting a data set into order can highlight features that are not obvious in the raw data, such as the lack of values between 3.4 and 4.9 in the data below.</p>

<dl>
		<dt>Skew distribution</dt>
		<dd>A distribution with a long tail to one side is called a <strong>skew</strong> distribution
&mdash; positively skew if the long tail is to the right and negatively skew if the
long tail is to the left. It  is not unusual for the extreme value in a very
skew distribution to be a  fair distance from the other values and may not be
an outlier.</dd>

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>If a dot plot, stem and leaf plot or histogram separates into two or more
groups of  values (clusters), this suggests that there may be more fundamental
differences between the 'individuals' in the groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_clusters.gif" width="499" height="140"></p>
	<p>Further investigation	should be made of	the individuals in the  clusters to find whether they also differ in other ways.</p>
	<p>If the clusters were less distinct, especially in small data sets, you would need external supporting evidence before concluding that the individuals separated into meaningful groups.</p>

  


<h2 class="pageName">2.3.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Distribution of values</p>
	<p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, the <strong>distribution
of values</strong>  also contains useful information. Important features
are:</p>
<ul>
		<li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
		<li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
		<li>Whether a distribution is <strong>symmetric</strong> or  <strong>skew</strong> — do the tails appear similar at both sides?</li>
		<li>Other aspects of the <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 
		concepts of centre and spread are particularly important.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.4 &nbsp; Extra information about individuals</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Extra information</p>
<p>When only a single value is known from each individual (or plant, item, etc),
all that can be discovered is the shape of the distribution of these values.</p>
<p>Additional information  about each individuals
may give insight into why some values are bigger or smaller than others. Different
types of information may be available. The simplest is a unique <strong>name</strong> for
the individuals &mdash; a textual label. These names may help us to understand why
values are outliers or group into clusters in a 
dot plot or stem and leaf plot.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.5 &nbsp; Distinguishing known groups</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Multiple groups of individuals</p>
<p>Sometimes we know that the individuals belong to two or more groups before
the data are collected or, equivalently, that they have different values of an
extra categorical variable.</p>
<p>Information about groups is best displayed by plotting the separate groups
against a common axis.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_stackedGroups.gif" width="399" height="348"></p>
<p class="heading">Back-to-back stem and leaf plots</p>
<p>Stem and leaf plots can be used to compare two groups of individuals,
if drawn on different
sides of a common column of stems. (They are less useful if there are three or
more groups.)</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.6 &nbsp; Dangers of overinterpretation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Dangers of overinterpretation</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Features in the distribution <strong>of a small data set</strong> may not
be meaningful.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Be careful <strong>not to overinterpret</strong> patterns in small
		data sets. Clusters, outliers or skewness may appear by chance even if there is
		no meaningful basis to these features. </p>
<p>Pronounced outliers or clusters may be taken as indicative of
		something meaningful in the underlying process. However <strong>less pronounced
			outliers or clusters must be supported by outside evidence</strong> before these features
		can be interpreted as meaningful.</p>
