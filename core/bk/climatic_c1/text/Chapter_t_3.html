<h2>3.1 &nbsp; Histograms and density</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 &nbsp; Density of values</h3>
<p>The heights of the stacks of crosses in a dot plot  describe the density of values.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h3>
<p>In a simple histogram, the height of the rectangle above each class on the axis equals the number of values in the class -- the class frequency.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h3>
<p>Class width and start-point should be chosen to make the histogram as smooth as possible -- neither too blocky nor too jagged.</p>
<h3>3.1.4 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h3>
<p>The shape of a histogram can be very dependent on the choice of classes if the data set is small; beware over-interpreting its shape. Stacked dot plots are a better display of small data sets.</p>
<h3>3.1.5 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h3>
<p>In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</p>
<h3>3.1.6 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h3>
<p>The vertical axis should be relative frequency, not frequency, when comparing two groups with histograms. Population pyramids are often used to compare age distributions.</p>
<h3>3.1.7 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h3>
<p>If a histogram has varying class widths, the vertical axis must be 'density'. The histogram shape would be misleading if frequency or relative frequency was used for the vertical axis.</p>
<h3>3.1.8 &nbsp; Understanding histograms</h3>
<p>The proportion of values in any classes always equals the proportion of the total histogram area that is above the classes.</p>
<h3>3.1.9 &nbsp; Frequency polygons</h3>
<p>Frequency polygons are closely related to histograms but give a less 'blocky' display of density. Different groups can be compared more easily with them.</p>
<h3>3.1.10 &nbsp; Kernel density estimates</h3>
<p>Kernel density estimates show density in a still smoother display.</p>
<h3>3.1.11 &nbsp; Drawing histograms by hand</h3>
<p>Histograms are based on frequency tables. Class boundaries should avoid possible data values.</p>
<h2>3.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles & box plots</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h3>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain detailed information that is distracting when two or more data sets are being compared.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h3>
<p>The median and quartiles split a batch of values into four equal-sized sets of values. A box plot is a graphical display of the median, quartiles and extremes.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 &nbsp; Interpreting a box plot's shape</h3>
<p>A box plot clearly shows the centre, spread and skewness of a data set. It splits the corresponding histogram into 4 approximately equal areas.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 &nbsp; Displaying outliers</h3>
<p>The basic box plot is often modified to display outliers as separate crosses.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>Box plots cannot show clusters, so must never be used for data with clusters.</p>
<h3>3.2.6 &nbsp; Comparison of groups</h3>
<p>Box plots are particularly effective for displaying differences between several groups of values.</p>
<h2>3.3 &nbsp; Discrete data (counts)</h2>
<h3>3.3.1 &nbsp; Discrete and continuous data</h3>
<p>Discrete data sets contain counts whereas continuous data sets could potentially contain any values within an interval. Stacked dot plots are good displays of small discrete data sets containing small counts.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 &nbsp; Histograms for counts</h3>
<p>When the range of possible counts is moderate or large, a histogram is an effective display of the distribution. Class width should be a whole number and class boundaries should end in '.5'.</p>
<h3>3.3.3 &nbsp; Bar charts</h3>
<p>When the range of possible counts is small, a bar chart is a better representation of the data than a histogram.</p>
