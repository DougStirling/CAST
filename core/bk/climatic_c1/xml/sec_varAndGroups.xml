<page dir="en/moreVariation" filePrefix="moreVariation2" summaryDir="en/moreVariation" summaryFilePrefix="s_moreVariation2" videoDir="en/moreVariation" videoFilePrefix="v_moreVariation2">In data sets that consist of different groups, the overall standard deviation is often much higher than the standard deviations within groups.</page>
<page dir="en/moreVariation" filePrefix="moreVariation3" summaryDir="en/moreVariation" summaryFilePrefix="s_moreVariation3" videoDir="en/moreVariation" videoFilePrefix="v_moreVariation3">Overall variation is partly explained by differences between groups, but some variation (within groups) remains unexplained. Because some variation is explained by the groups (and unexplained variation is reduced), the grouping allows you to predict a new value more accurately.</page>
<page dir="en/multiGroup" filePrefix="multiGroup_a4" summaryDir="en/multiGroup" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiGroup4" videoDir="en/multiGroup" videoFilePrefix="v_multiGroup4">The relative size of within- and between-group variation indicates whether the groups really differ.</page>
<page dir="en/multiGroup" filePrefix="multiGroup5" summaryDir="en/multiGroup" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiGroup5" videoDir="en/multiGroup" videoFilePrefix="v_multiGroup5">Variability within groups and between groups are described by sums of squares.</page>
<page dir="en/multiGroup" filePrefix="multiGroup_a6" summaryDir="en/multiGroup" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiGroup6" videoDir="en/multiGroup" videoFilePrefix="v_multiGroup6">The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is the ratio of the between-groups and total sums of squares. It is the proportion of variation that can be explained by differences between the groups.</page>
<page dir="en/multiGroup" filePrefix="multiGroup_a7" summaryDir="en/multiGroup" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiGroup7" videoDir="en/multiGroup" videoFilePrefix="v_multiGroup7">The mean total and within-group sums of squares are closely related to the overall standard deviation and the standard deviations within the groups. They are often arranged in an analysis of variance table.</page>
