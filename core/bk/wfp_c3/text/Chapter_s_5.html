<h2 class="pageName">5.1.1 &nbsp; Inference</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Inference</p>
<p><strong>Statistical inference</strong> refers to statistical
	techniques for obtaining information about a population parameter (or parameters) from
	a  random sample. There are two branches of inference:</p>
<p class=heading>Estimation</p>
<p>Point estimates and confidence intervals give answers to questions of the form:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>What parameter values would be consistent with the sample data?</p></div></div>
<p class=heading>Hypothesis tests</p>
<p>This chapter deals with a related type of question:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>Are the sample data consistent with some statement about the parameters?</p></div></div>
<p class=heading>Errors and strength of evidence</p>
<p>A single random sample can rarely provide enough information 
	about a population parameter to allow us to be sure whether or not any statement (hypothesis)
	about that parameter will be true. The best we can hope for is an indication of 
	the <strong>strength of the evidence</strong> against it. </p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.2 &nbsp; Soccer league simulation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Randomness in sports results</p>
<p>Although we like to think that the 'best' team wins in sports competitions, 
there is actually considerable variability in the results that 
can only be explained through randomness. For example when  two teams play a series
of matches, the same team rarely wins all matches.</p>
<p class=heading>English Premier Soccer League, 2008/09</p>
<p>In the English Premier Soccer league, each team plays every other 
team twice (home and away) during the season. Three points are awarded for a win 
and one point for a draw. The table below shows the wins, draws, losses and total 
points for all teams at the end of the 2008/09 season.</p>

<p class=heading>Were all teams evenly matched?</p>
<p>A simulation can help us to investigate this question. We could be used to generate results from all 380 matches in the season for evenly matched teams, each result having probabilities 0.372, 0.372 and 0.255 of being a win, loss or draw for the home team. (A proportion 0.255 of games in the actual league resulted in draws.)</p>
<p>If there are differences between teams, we would expect the worst teams to have very few points at the end of the season and the best to have many. On the other hand, for evenly matched teams, we would expect all 20 finals points to be similar. The <strong>spread of final points</strong> in the league table should tell us something about whether the teams are evenly matched.</p>
<p>In the actual league table, the standard deviation of the final points for the 20 teams was 18.236. The diagram below shows the standard deviations in 200 simulated league tables with evenly matched teams.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testIntro/images/s_leagueSdSim.gif" width="357" height="150"></p>
<p>The spread of points in the actual league table was much higher than the spread that would be likely for evenly matched teams, so:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>There is strong evidence that the top teams are 'better' than the bottom teams.</p></div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.3 &nbsp; Simulation to test a proportion</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Is a population proportion equal to 0.8, or is it lower?</p>
<p>Consider a random sample of <em>n</em> = 100 values from a population in which
it is claimed that the probability of success is at least 0.80.</p>
<p>Is an observed count of <em>x</em> = 72 successes low enough to throw
doubt on the claimed probability of success, 0.80?</p>
<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
<p>We can perform a simulation with probability 0.80 of success to generate
a random sample 100 successes and failures. The
diagram below shows the numbers of successes in 200 such simulations.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testIntro/images/s_successSim.gif" width="401" height="209"></p>
<p>If the probability of success was really 0.80, there would
be approximately <sup>10</sup>/<sub>200</sub> = 5% chance of 72 or successes
being observed. Since this is low,</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is moderately strong evidence that the probability
of success is less than 0.80 &mdash; observing only 72 successes would be unlikely
if the probability really was 0.80.</p>
</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.4 &nbsp; Test for a mean</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Does a random sample have mean  520?</p>
<p>In an industrial process, some measurement, <em>X</em>, is
normally distributed with standard deviation σ = 10. Its mean should be µ = 520
but  can drift from this, so samples of <em>n</em> = 10 measurements are regularly
collected as part of quality control.</p>
<p>If one such sample had mean 529, does the process need to
be adjusted? The question can be reexpressed as:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If the underlying population mean was really µ = 520, what is the chance a
sample of 10 values having a mean as far from 520 as 529?</p>
</div></div>
<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
<p>We can base our answer on the distribution of the sample mean, assuming that
<em>X</em> has a normal distribution with µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520 and
σ = 10. Simulations of 10 values from this distribution can be used to
get an approximate distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testIntro/images/s_meanSim.gif" width="402" height="173"></p>
<p>From the 200 simulated samples above, it seems very unlikely that a sample
mean of 529 would have been recorded if the process meanhad been µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520.
We therefore conclude that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is strong evidence that the process no longer has a mean  of µ = 520
and needs to be adjusted.</p>
</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.5 &nbsp; Randomisation tests</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>

<p class=heading>Randomisation of samples from two populations</p>
<p>Consider random samples from two populations. If these populations are identical,
any of the sampled values could have equally belonged to either population. Random
variations of the data can be generated by randomly allocating the values to
the two samples.</p>
<p>The diagram below gives an example of two-group data and a random allocation
of the 101 values to the two groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testIntro/images/s_randomisation.gif" width="434" height="317"></p>
<p class=heading>Test for equal population means</p>
<p>In the example above, the mean for Group A was 0.902 higher than that for
Group B. To examine whether the underlying population means are equal, we can
find how far apart the sample means would be in randomised variations of the
data.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the difference between the Group A and Group B means
for 100 randomised variations of the data.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testIntro/images/s_randomiseDist.gif" width="475" height="165"></p>
<p>A difference between sample means as large as that recorded would be unusual
if both underlying populations were the same, so</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We  conclude that there is strong evidence that the population means for the
two groups are different.</p>

<p class=heading>Randomisation</p>
<p><strong>If <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> were unrelated,</strong> any permutation
of the values of <em>X</em> would have been equally likely, so
we can generate random variations of the data by shuffling the values of <em>X</em> between
the individuals.</p>
<p>The correlation between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> in the data was 0.537. To
assess whether such a large correlation could have arisen if <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> were
unrelated, we can use randomisations to investigate
the distribution of the correlation coefficient when they are unrelated.
The diagram below shows the correlation coefficients from 200 randomisations
of the data.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testIntro/images/s_randomiseCorr.gif" width="402" height="173"></p>
<p>Since there would only be a <sup>7</sup>/<sub>200</sub> = 3.5% chance of a
sample correlation being as far from zero as that observed, we can
conclude that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">

<p class=heading>Inference and random samples</p>
<p>In the rest of this chapter, we assume that the observed data are a random sample
from some population. Inference asks questions about characteristics
of the underlying population distribution &mdash; unknown population parameters.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses specify values
for the unknown  parameters.</p>
</div></div>

<p class=heading>Categorical populations</p>
<p>For categorical populations, the unknowns are the population
probabilities for the different categories. We focus on one category that is of particular
interest ('success').</p>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses are  specified in terms of the probability
of success, π.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.2 &nbsp; P-value for testing proportion</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Test statistic</p>
<p>A test about a probability, π, could be based on the corresponding sample proportion, <em>p</em>,
but it is  more
convenient to use the <strong>number</strong> of successes, <em>x</em>,
rather than <em>p</em> since we know its distribution,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed percent50">
<p><em>X</em>&nbsp; ~ &nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">binomial</font> (<em>n</em>&nbsp;, &pi;)</p>
</div></div>

<p class=heading>P-value</p>
<p>The p-value is the probability of getting such an 'extreme'
set of data if the null hypothesis is true. Since we know the binomial distribution
of <em>X</em> when the null hypothesis
holds,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The p-value is a sum of binomial probabilities</p>
</div></div>

<p>Note that the p-value can be obtained exactly <strong>without need for simulations
or randomisation</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading>Example</p>
<p>In 100 values from a categorical population, 72 successes were observed. Is this

<p class=heading>Telepathy experiment</p>
<p>In a telepathy experiment, one
subject selects 90 cards with  random shapes (circle, square or cross) and attempts
to 'send' the shapes to another subject who is out of sight. The subject correctly
guesses 36 shapes.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(guessing)</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(telepathy)</p>
<p>If the subject is guessing, the number of correct choices will be binomial with
π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;90. </p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testPropn/images/s_binom2.gif" width="356" height="212"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the probability of getting as 'extreme' a count as
was observed if the subject guesses, 0.1103. Since this is high, we
conclude that there is no evidence of telepathy from the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Interpretation of p-values</p>
<p>A p-value only tells you whether the data are consistent with the null hypothesis or
are inconsistent with it. From a very small p-value, we can conclude that the null
hypothesis is probably wrong. However a high p-value does not mean that the null
hypothesis is correct, only that the observed data are consistent with it. In the
telepathy example, we could never be sure that π was not very very slightly different
from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>There is a probability 0.1085 of getting 26 or fewer, but large sample numbers

 <p class="eqn"><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.5</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; 0.5</strong></span></p>

<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testPropn/images/s_normalApprox.gif" width="352" height="165"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the probability of 369 or fewer from this distribution.
Since this probability is virtually zero, we conclude that π is almost certainly
less than 0.5.</p>

<p>To find this tail probability, any value of <em>x</em> between 369 and 370

estimate by using 369.5. This is called a <strong>continuity correction</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">5.2.6 &nbsp; Statistical distance</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Difference between parameter and estimate</p>
<p>If the  value of a parameter
specified by the null hypothesis (e.g. a population proportion, π<sub>0</sub>) is
close to the corresponding sample statistic (e.g. the sample proportion, <em>p</em>)
then there is no reason to doubt the null hypothesis. However if they
are far apart, the data are not consistent with the null hypothesis and we should
conclude that the alternative hypothesis holds.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A large distance between the estimate and hypothesized value gives evidence
against the null hypothesis.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Statistical distance</p>
<p>To help assess this difference, we express it as a <strong>number of standard
errors</strong> since we know from the 70-95-100 rule of thumb that that
2 (standard errors) is a large distance, 3 is a very large distance, and 1 is
not much.</p>
<p>For a proportion, the number of standard errors is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/testPropn/images/zForP.gif" id="gif_image_2_6_2" width="186" height="56"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/testPropn/images/zForP.svg" id="svg_image_2_6_2" width="186" height="56" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_6_2");</script></p>
<p>In general, the <strong>statistical distance</strong> of an estimate to a

<p>Values more than 2, or less than -2,  suggests that the hypothesized
value is wrong. However if <em>z</em> is close to zero, <em>p</em> is reasonably
close to π<sub>0</sub> and we should not doubt the null hypothesis.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.7 &nbsp; Tests based on statistical distance</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Test statistic and p-value</p>
<p>The <strong>statistical distance</strong> of an estimate to a hypothesised

<p>If the null hypothesis holds, <em>z</em> has
approximately a standard normal distribution and it can be used as a test statistic
for tests about the parameter. The p-value can be determined from the tail areas
of this standard normal distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/testMean/images/pValueFromZ.gif" id="gif_image_2_7_1" width="471" height="212"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/testMean/images/pValueFromZ.svg" id="svg_image_2_7_1" width="471" height="212" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_7_1");</script></p>
<p>For a two-tailed test, the p-value is the red tail area and can be looked
up using either normal tables or in Excel.</p>
<p class=heading>Example</p>
<p>We again examine a data set in which 369 out of 899 home-based businesses
were owned by women. Are less than 50% of such businesses owned by women?</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.5</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; 0.5</strong></span></p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the 'statistical distance' of the sample proportion
from 0.5 is calculated.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/testPropn/images/s_testP.gif" width="419" height="224"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the lower tail area of the standard normal distribution
and is virtually zero here, so we again conclude that it is almost certain that
less than 50% of such businesses are owned by women.</p>
<p>Using a 'statistical distance' to test a proportion gives a p-value that is <strong>identical</strong> to
the p-value based on a normal approximation to the number of successes <strong>without</strong> a
continuity correction. (The p-value is slightly different if a continuity correction
is used.) However this approach will  be used to  test many different
kinds of parameter in later sections.</p>
<p>(The procedure will be refined slightly 
when applied to situations where the standard error of the estimate must itself
be estimated from the sample data. A t distribution will be used instead of a
standard normal distribution.)</p>
