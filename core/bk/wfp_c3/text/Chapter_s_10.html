<h2 class="pageName">10.1.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Population and census</p>
	<p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
		fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
		group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
	<p>Collecting measurements  from every item in the  population is called a <strong>census</strong>. A census is rarely feasible,  because of the  cost and time involved.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
	<p>We can usually obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
	collecting information from a selection of units from the population &mdash; a <strong>sample</strong>. Although a sample gives less accurate information than a census, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample  is  
		a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In it, each unit has the same chance 
		of being selected and some random mechanism is used to determine whether any particular unit is 
		included in the sample.	</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	<p>It is convenient 
		to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
		than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
		corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>

<p class=heading>Estimating means and proportions</p>
	<p>A random sample is often used to <strong>estimate</strong> some  numerical characteristic of the population, such as...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The mean of some variable</li>
		<li>The proportion in some category</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The difference between an estimate and the population value being estimated is called 
		its <strong>sampling error</strong>. </p>

<h2 class="pageName">10.1.4 &nbsp; Sampling error and sample size</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Effect of sample size on sampling error</p>
	<p>The larger the sample size, the smaller the sampling error. However when the 
		population is large, sampling a small proportion of the population may still give 
		accurate estimates. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Sampling error depends much more strongly on the sample size than 
				on the proportion of the population that is sampled.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>For example, a sample of 10 from a population of 10,000 people will estimate 
		the proportion of males almost as accurately as a sample of size 10 from a population 
		of 100.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">10.1.5 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Different sampling schemes</p>
	<p><strong>Two 
			different</strong> ways to collect a random sample of <em>n</em> values from a finite population of size <em>N</em> are common. In both sampling schemes, each population value has the same chance of being in the sample.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Sampling with replacement (SWR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWR, the first selected value is <strong>returned to the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from all <i>N</i> population values. </dd>
		<dt>Sampling without replacement (SWOR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWOR, the first selected value is <strong>removed from the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from the remaining <i>N</i> - 1 population 
		values, etc.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Since a SWR may contain the same population value more than once, it covers less of the population than SWOR. SWOR therefore gives more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Large populations and/or small samples</p>
	<p>If the sample size, <i>n</i>, is much smaller than the population size, <i>N</i>, 
		there is little practical difference between SWR and SWOR &mdash; there would be little 
		chance of the same individual being picked twice in SWR.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">10.1.6 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Selecting a sample manually (raffle tickets)</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Write the names (or other identification) of all population members on identical 
			pieces of paper,</li>
		<li>Mix them thoroughly in a box</li>
		<li>Select <em>n</em> pieces of paper (with or without replacement).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This method is  rarely used in research applications.</p>
	<p class="heading">Selecting a  sample with random numbers</p>
	<p>To select a random sample without replacement using random numbers,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Number all population members, starting from index 0.</li>
		<li>Generate a random index between 0 and the largest population index.</li>
		<li>If sampling <strong>without</strong> replacement and the generated index has already been selected, go back to step 2 and select another index.<br>
		</li>
		<li>Add the selected population member to the sample, then repeat steps 2. and 3. until a large enough sample has been selected.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="heading">Random number between 0 and <em>k</em></p>
	<p>The easiest way to generate a random number between 0 and 357 is to use a spreadsheet such as Excel &mdash; it has a function designed for this purpose, &quot;=RANDBETWEEN(0, 357)&quot;. A computer-generated random value is strictly called a <em>pseudo-random</em> number.</p>
	<p>If a computer is not available, a sequence of random digits can be generated:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><img src="../../../en/popSamp/images/die.jpg" width="150" height="123" align="right">Roll a 10-sided 
			die several times.</li>
		<li>In a printed book of random digits, start at a random position in a random page, then use 
			a sequence of digits starting from there.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A random number that is equally likely to have any value between 0 and 357 can be found by repeatedly generating 3-digit numbers (between 0 and 999) until a value between 0 and 357 is obtained.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">10.2.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>A simple random sample of individuals from a population is the easiest sampling scheme to understand, but other sampling schemes may give more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Grouping of individuals</p>
	<p>If the individuals in the population can be split into different groups (called <strong>strata</strong> in sampling terminology), it is often better to take a 
		simple random sample <strong>within each separate group</strong> than to sample 
		randomly from the whole population. This is called a <strong>stratified random 
			sample</strong>.</p>
	<p>The  proportion sampled from the different strata are usually fixed to be the same as the proportions of individuals in the strata in the population. In a simple random sample, the proportions sampled from the strata might not match the population proportions, so a stratified random sample should be more 'representative'.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/sampPractice/images/s_stratified.gif" width="418" height="351"> </p>
	<p>The benefits from stratified random sampling are greatest if the measurement 
		being sampled is different in the different strata.</p>
	<p class="heading">Groups with different variability (advanced)</p>
	<p>In stratified random samples, random samples are usually taken from the different 
		strata in proportion to the number of population values in the strata.</p>
	<p>This proportionality is not however essential, and greater accuracy can be 
		obtained by selecting larger samples from strata with greater variability. However 
		if sample size is not proportional to stratum size, the overall sample mean is 
		no longer appropriate for estimating the overall population mean.</p>
	<p>If there are <em>k</em> strata of size <em>N</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>N</em><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<em>N<sub>k</sub></em>, 
		and samples of size <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<em>n<sub>k</sub></em> are taken from the strata, giving means <img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub>1</sub></span>, <img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub>2</sub></span>, ..., <img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub><em>k</em></sub></span> , then the population mean should be estimated by</p>

<h2 class="pageName">10.2.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling frame</p>
	<p>Before taking a simple random sample or stratified random sample, a complete 
		list of all individuals in the target population must be available. This is called a <strong>sampling 
			frame</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
	<p>If a complete sampling frame is not available, it may be possible to group the target individuals into reasonably 
	small groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>, for which a complete list is available.</p>
	<p>Clusters are similar to the strata that are used for stratified sampling, but 
		are usually much smaller. For example, a cluster might contain all of the houses in a street, or all of the individuals in a household. It is not necessary to know beforehand how many individuals are in each of the clusters.</p>
	<p>For cluster sampling, a <strong>simple random sample of clusters</strong> is 
		selected, with all individuals in these clusters selected.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cost advantages</p>
	<p>Even when a complete sampling frame is available, cluster sampling might be 
		used to reduce the cost of sampling (or to increase the sample size for the same 
		cost) since it is often cheaper to record information from individuals in the 
		same cluster than from different parts of the sampling frame.</p>
	<p class="heading">Accuracy of cluster sampling</p>
	<p>The disadvantage of cluster sampling is that estimates are usually less accurate than the corresponding estimates from 
	a simple random sample of the same size.</p>
	<p>However the cost advantages would permit a larger sample size, so cluster sampling may give the best estimates <strong>for a fixed cost</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">10.2.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling from large populations</p>
	<p>Two-stage sampling is a sampling scheme that is related to cluster sampling, 
		but is of most use for large populations when the individuals are very widely 
		separated in some sense. For example, many polls are conducted to obtain <strong>national</strong> information about voting intentions or consumer purchases, and there is a high 
		cost associated with travelling between different regions.</p>
	<p>In two-stage sampling, the population is separated into groups of adjacent 
		individuals called <strong>primary sampling units</strong>. These primary sampling 
		units are typically large &mdash; for example a country might be split into 20 or more 
		regions. A small number of these are selected according to some sampling scheme, 
		then individuals are sub-sampled within each selected primary unit.</p>
	<p>Costs are reduced by limiting sampling to a small number of primary units. 
		For example, if individuals are only sampled from within say 5 regions, travelling 
		and accommodation costs will be considerably reduced.</p>
