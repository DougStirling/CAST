<h1>Chapter 7 &nbsp; Comparing Two Means</h1>
<h2>7.1 &nbsp; Models for two groups</h2>
<h3>7.1.1 &nbsp; Interest in underlying population</h3>
<p>As with single-group data, the populations underlying two-group data sets are usually of more interest than the specific sample data.</p>
<h3>7.1.2 &nbsp; Model for two groups</h3>
<p>Two-group data sets are often modelled as separate random samples from two normal populations.</p>
<h3>7.1.3 &nbsp; Parameters of the normal model</h3>
<p>The normal model has four parameters — the means and standard deviations in the two groups.</p>
<h3>7.1.4 &nbsp; Parameter estimates</h3>
<p>The parameters of the normal model can be estimated by the sample means and standard deviations in the two groups.</p>
<h3>7.1.5 &nbsp; Difference between means</h3>
<p>The difference between the population means is of particular interest. The difference between the sample means provides an estimate. It varies from sample to sample and has a distribution.</p>
<h2>7.2 &nbsp; Distn of sums and differences</h2>
<h3>7.2.1 &nbsp; Means and sums of samples</h3>
<p>The mean of a random sample is approximately normal with s.d. equal to σ divided by √n. The sum of a random sample is also approximately normal, but its s.d. is σ times √n.</p>
<h3>7.2.2 &nbsp; Sum and difference</h3>
<p>The sum and difference of two independent normal variables is also normally distributed. If they have the same standard deviation, σ, the  sum and difference  both have standard deviation 1.414σ. (Their variance is 2σ.)</p>
<h3>7.2.3 &nbsp; Sum and difference (cont)</h3>
<p>This page generalises the results to the sum and difference of variables whose standard deviations may be different.</p>
<h3>7.2.4 &nbsp; Probabilities for sums and differences</h3>
<p>If two variables are independent and have normal distributions, probabilities relating to their sum and difference can be found using the formulae for the mean and standard deviation of sums and differences.</p>
<h2>7.3 &nbsp; Confidence interval for difference</h2>
<h3>7.3.1 &nbsp; Distn of difference between means</h3>
<p>The difference between the means of two samples from normal populations has a normal distribution whose mean and s.d. can be found from the population means and s.d.s. This is the approximate distribution even when the populations are non-normal.</p>
<h3>7.3.2 &nbsp; SE of difference between means</h3>
<p>When the difference between the sample means is used to estimate the difference between the underlying population means, there is likely to be an error. The error distribution is approximately normal with mean 0. A formula for its standard deviation is given.</p>
<h3>7.3.3 &nbsp; CI for difference between means</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence interval is given for the difference between two population means. Its properties are demonstrated.</p>
<h2>7.4 &nbsp; Hypothesis test for difference</h2>
<h3>7.4.1 &nbsp; Testing a hypothesis</h3>
<p>A hypothesis test is developed for testing whether two group means are the same.</p>
<h3>7.4.2 &nbsp; One-tailed tests for differences</h3>
<p>If the alternative hypothesis is for one particular mean to be greater, then the p-value for the test is found from only one tail of the t distribution.</p>
<h2>7.5 &nbsp; Paired t test</h2>
<h3>7.5.1 &nbsp; Paired data</h3>
<p>Paired data are a type of bivariate data in which two similar measurements are made from each individual. We are usually interested in testing whether the means of both measurements are the same.</p>
<h3>7.5.2 &nbsp; Analysis of differences</h3>
<p>For paired data, differences between the two measurements hold all information about whether the means of both variables are the same.</p>
<h3>7.5.3 &nbsp; Paired t-test</h3>
<p>Testing for a difference between the means of the measurements is done with an ordinary t-test for whether the mean difference is zero.</p>
<h3>7.5.4 &nbsp; Pairing and experimental design</h3>
<p>To estimate or test the difference between two means, it is sometimes possible to collect data from two independent samples or from paired units. If the paired units are similar, a pair data gives more accurate results.</p>
