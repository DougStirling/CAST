<h1>Chapter 9 &nbsp; Independence</h1>
<h2>9.1 &nbsp; Bivariate categorical distributions</h2>
<h3>9.1.1 &nbsp; Relationships between variables</h3>
<p>If two categorical variables can be treated as a response and explanatory variable, the explanatory variable can be used to split the individuals into groups. If neither variable can be treated as explanatory, we need other ways to describe their association.</p>
<h3>9.1.2 &nbsp; 3-dimensional bar charts</h3>
<p>Bivariate distributions can be displayed in 3-dimensional bar charts but there are better ways to show the data.</p>
<h3>9.1.3 &nbsp; Clustered bar charts</h3>
<p>A 2-dimensional bar chart can be used to display the joint distribution of two categorical variables, with the bars clustered by one or other of the variables.</p>
<h3>9.1.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>The two marginal distributions are found by adding the joint frequencies (or proportions) across rows or down columns of a contingency table.</p>
<h3>9.1.5 &nbsp; Conditional distributions</h3>
<p>Conditional distributions are obtained by scaling the rows (or columns) of a contingency table to make them all sum to 1.0.</p>
<h3>9.1.6 &nbsp; More about conditional distributions</h3>
<p>Be careful to distinguish between the conditional distribution of Y given X, and that of X given Y.</p>
<h3>9.1.7 &nbsp; Conditional vs marginal distns</h3>
<p>Proportional Venn diagrams are a useful way to display joint distributions and to understand the relationships between conditional and marginal distributions.</p>
<h2>9.2 &nbsp; Independence</h2>
<h3>9.2.1 &nbsp; Association</h3>
<p>Two categorical variables, X and Y, are associated (related) when the conditional distribution of Y given X=x is different for different values of x. Knowing the value of X therefore tells you something about Y.</p>
<h3>9.2.2 &nbsp; Independence</h3>
<p>When the conditional distribution of Y is the same for all values of X, the variables are called independent. This special case is of practical importance.</p>
<h2>9.3 &nbsp; Testing for independence</h2>
<h3>9.3.1 &nbsp; Independence from samples</h3>
<p>Independence is a population property. To assess independence from a sample contingency table, the observed cell counts are compared to those estimated from a model with independence.</p>
<h3>9.3.2 &nbsp; Testing for independence</h3>
<p>The raw sum of squared differences between observed and estimated cell counts is not a good test statistic.</p>
<h3>9.3.3 &nbsp; Chi-squared test statistic</h3>
<p>The 'chi-squared' statistic is a modified sum of squared differences that has a standard distribution (a chi-squared distribution) when there is independence.</p>
<h3>9.3.4 &nbsp; P-value for chi-squared test</h3>
<p>The chi-squared statistic can be used to find a p-value for testing independence. The p-value has similar interpretation and properties to p-values for all other hypothesis tests.</p>
<h3>9.3.5 &nbsp; Examples</h3>
<p>The chi-squared test is applied to a few real data sets. When the variables are found to be associated, the nature of the relationship is described from a comparison of observed and estimated cell counts.</p>
<h3>9.3.6 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h3>
<p>The chi-squared test assesses independence of two categorical variables. It is also used to test whether a single categorical variable has the same distribution in several groups.</p>
