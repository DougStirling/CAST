  <p>General linear models (GLMs) were introduced to describe situations in which 
		a response variable is linearly related to one or more <strong>numerical</strong> 
		explanatory variables. We have also shown how the same class of GLMs can be 
		used to model:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>nonlinear relationships with polynomial models, and</li>
		<li>simple interactions between the effects of explanatory variables with 
			terms that involve the product of other explanatory variables.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In this chapter, we show that GLMs can also be used to model the relationship 
		between a response and one or more <strong>categorical</strong> explanatory 
		variables. These GLMs involve numerical 'explanatory variables' called <strong>indicator 
		variables</strong> that are not direct measurements but are defined in a way 
		that gives the GLMs useful properties.</p>
	<p>Using these extensions, it is largely possible to ignore the distinction 
		between numerical and categorical explanatory variables when modelling a response.</p>
