  <p>This chapter describes and demonstrates some distribution theory behind analysis 
		of variance.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><strong>The material is much more theoretical 
						and less practical than other CAST chapters.</strong></p>
</div></div>

	<p>In a previous version of CAST, the theory in this chapter was interspersed 
		with the more practical material in earlier chapters. However analysis of 
		variance can be understood without knowledge of its underlying distributions, 
		and the distribution theory turned off many readers who only wanted practical 
		information about regression.</p>
