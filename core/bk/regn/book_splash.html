  <p>The main  CAST e-books cover topics that are usually taught in introductory 
		statistical methods courses. The material in this CAST e-book is more advanced 
		and is usually left until a second statistics course or later.</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><span class="red">This e-book shows how to model variation 
				in a 'response' variable in terms of one or more 'explanatory' variables.</span></p>
</div></div>

	<p>The e-book starts by revising simple linear regression (with a single numerical 
		explanatory variable). Regression diagnostics include material about the concepts of 
		leverage, outliers and influence.</p>
	
<p>These ideas are extended to multiple linear regression (in which variation 
    in a response variable is explaned by two or more explanatory variables). 
    Matrix notation is  a concise way to describe these models. The 
    concept of interaction is also explained.</p>
<p>Analysis of variance is a powerful technique for analysing multiple regression 
    models. In particular, it helps to explain the consequences of multicollinearity 
    in data. Analysis of variance is used to test hypotheses about the models.</p>
	
  <p>The multiple regression model (which is also called a General Linear Model) 
    can also model situations involving categorical explanatory variables. A chapter 
    describes modelling and inference for these models.</p>
  <p>Finally, an optional chapter explains some of the statistical theory behind 
    analysis of variance.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The material assumes a good understanding 
				of basic statistical concepts and methods. You are therefore strongly 
				advised to revise the basics from one of the main CAST e-books before 
				studying the material here.</p>
