<page dir='en/leastSqrsTwo' filePrefix='leastSqrsTwo1'>In many data sets, two or more explanatory variables could potentially affect the response. Using two or more explanatory variables may give more accurate predictions.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrsTwo' filePrefix='leastSqrsTwo2'>Data sets with two explanatory variables and a response can be effectively displayed in a rotating 3-dimensional scatterplot.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrsTwo' filePrefix='leastSqrsTwo3'>The simple linear model can be extended by adding another linear term involving a second explanatory variable. This equation represents a plane in 3-dimensions.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrsTwo' filePrefix='leastSqrsTwo4'>The intercept is the predicted y-value when x and z are zero. The two slope parameters give the predicted change in y when x and z increase by one.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrsTwo' filePrefix='leastSqrsTwo5'>The linear model provides predictions at all x- and z-values. The prediction for the x- and z-value corresponding to the i'th data point is its fitted value and the difference between this and the recorded y-value is its residual.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrsTwo' filePrefix='leastSqrsTwo6'>Parameter estimates that result in small residuals are good.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrsTwo' filePrefix='leastSqrsTwo7'>An objective estimation method is to minimise the sum of squared residuals -- the principle of least squares.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrsTwo' filePrefix='leastSqrsTwo8'>The slope coefficients give the predicted effect of changes to one variable, but only when the other variable remains the same.</page>
