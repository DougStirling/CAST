<page dir='en/catInteract' filePrefix='catInteract1'>Interaction between two numerical variables can be modelled in a GLM with a term involving the product of the variables.</page>
<page dir='en/catInteract' filePrefix='catInteract2'>If there is no interaction between a numerical and categorical explanatory variable, the regression lines for all categories are parallel. If these regression lines are not parallel, then there is interaction. Extra terms can be added to the no-interaction GLM to model the interaction.</page>
<page dir='en/catInteract' filePrefix='catInteract3'>The existence of interaction can be tested with a test for whether the parameters for the interaction terms are zero. This can be done with a t-test if there are only 2 categories, but an F-test is needed for more categories.</page>
<page dir='en/catInteract' filePrefix='catInteract4'>Indicator variables can be added to the no-interaction GLM to model an interaction between 2 categorical variables.</page>
<page dir='en/catInteract' filePrefix='catInteract5'>Testing for interaction is equivalent to testing whether the parameters for the interaction indicator variables are all zero.</page>
<page dir='en/catInteract' filePrefix='catInteract6'>An example is shown with several main effects and interactions.</page>
