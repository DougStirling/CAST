	<p>This section describes the distributions of the explained and residual sums of squares in simple regression and demonstrates that the F ratio in an anova table has an F distribution if the true regression slope is zero.</p>

<page dir='en/regnAnovaDist' filePrefix='regnAnovaDist1'>The residual sum of squares has a chi-squared distribution with (n - 2) d.f. The explained sum of squares only has a chi-squared distribution (1 d.f.) if Y is unrelated to X -- its distribution has a higher mean otherwise.</page>
<page dir='en/regnAnovaDist' filePrefix='regnAnovaDist2'>The ratio of the mean explained and mean residual sums of squares has an F distribution with (1, n-2) d.f. if Y is unrelated to X. The F ratio is expected to be higher if the variables are related.</page>
<page dir='en/regnAnovaDist' filePrefix='regnAnovaDist3'>The F ratio can be used to test whether the variables are related (i.e. to test whether the model slope is zero).</page>
