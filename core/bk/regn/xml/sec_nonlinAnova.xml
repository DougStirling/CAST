<page dir='en/nonlinAnova' filePrefix='nonlinAnova1'>Linearity can be assessed by comparing the fits of a linear and quadratic model. The total sum of squares can be split into linear, quadratic and residual sums of squares.</page>
<page dir='en/nonlinAnova' filePrefix='nonlinAnova2'>The quadratic sum of squares compares the fit of a linear and quadratic model and therefore holds information about whether there is curvature in the data.</page>
<page dir='en/nonlinAnova' filePrefix='nonlinAnova3'>An F ratio comparing the quadratic and residual mean sums of squares can be used to test for linearity.</page>
<page dir='en/nonlinAnova' filePrefix='nonlinAnova4'>In polynomial models, only one order of adding terms is meaningful. This means that only a single anova table is possible.</page>
<page dir='en/nonlinAnova' filePrefix='nonlinAnova5'>Analysis of variance can test the significance of the reduction in the residual sums of squares from adding quadratic terms in X and Z to a model with linear terms in both variables.</page>
<page dir='en/nonlinAnova' filePrefix='nonlinAnova6'>Testing whether the coefficient of XZ is zero can be done with either a t-test or analysis of variance. Both tests give the same p-value.</page>
