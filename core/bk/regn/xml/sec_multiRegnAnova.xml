<page dir='en/multiRegnAnova' filePrefix='multiRegnAnova1'>The difference between each response value and the overall mean can be split into a component explained by the explanatory variables and a residual.</page>
<page dir='en/multiRegnAnova' filePrefix='multiRegnAnova2'>The total, regression and residual sum of squares contain information about how well the explanatory variables explain variability in the response. The coefficient of determination is a useful summary statistic.</page>
<page dir='en/multiRegnAnova' filePrefix='multiRegnAnova3'>The ratio of the mean regression and residual sums of squares has an F distribution if the response is unrelated to the explanatory variables but is larger if they are related. It can be used as a test statistic for whether there is a relationship.</page>
<page dir='en/multiRegnAnova' filePrefix='multiRegnAnova4'>A similar F test can simultaneously test whether all slope parameters in a GLM are zero.</page>
<page dir='en/multiRegnAnova' filePrefix='multiRegnAnova5'>The coefficient of determination, R-sqr, describes the proportion of response variation that is explained by the model. The F ratio describes the strength of evidence for there being any relationship at all. In large samples, R-sqr can be small even when F is large.</page>
