<section name='Interaction'>


<page dir='en/interact' filePrefix='interact1'>In the models in previous sections, the effect of X on Y was the same for all values of Z and similarly the effect of Z on Y was the same, whatever the value of X.</page>
<page dir='en/interact' filePrefix='interact2'>Interaction between X and Z occurs when the effect on Y of increasing X is different for different values of Z. Adding a term in XZ to the model may explain the interaction.</page>
<page dir='en/interact' filePrefix='interact3'>A t-test for whether the coefficient of XZ is zero provides a simple test for interaction.</page>
<page dir='en/interact' filePrefix='interact4'>The existence and amount of interaction is affected by nonlinear transformations of the response. Sometimes analysing the log response can remove interaction, making the results easier to interpret.</page>
<page dir='en/interact' filePrefix='interact5'>In this page, a data set that has both curvature and interaction is analysed.</page>
