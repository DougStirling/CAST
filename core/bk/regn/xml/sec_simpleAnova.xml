	<p>This section takes an anova approach to testing whether the mean of a normal population equals a specified value and shows that this is equivalent to the standard t-test. It also shows an anova table for testing whether two group variances are equal.</p>

<page dir='en/simpleAnova' filePrefix='simpleAnova1'>The two component sums of squares can be used to test the value of the population mean. The ratio of the mean sums of squares has an F distribution if the null hypothesis holds.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleAnova' filePrefix='simpleAnova2'>The p-value for the test is the upper tail area of the F distribution.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleAnova' filePrefix='simpleAnova3'>The F test based on the anova table results in the same p-value and conclusion as a t test for the hypotheses.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleAnova' filePrefix='simpleAnova4'>Components can be defined whose sums of squares hold information about the difference between the group means, the variability within group 1 and the variability within group 2.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleAnova' filePrefix='simpleAnova5'>The sums of squares of the two within-group components lead to the same F test that was described in an earlier section for whether the group variances are equal.</page>
