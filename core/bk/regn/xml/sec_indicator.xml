<section name='Indicator variable for two groups'>


<page dir='en/indicator' filePrefix='indicator1'>We assume that the data arise as random samples from two normal populations with the same standard deviation.</page>
<page dir='en/indicator' filePrefix='indicator2'>A linear model with an explanatory variable whose value is 0 or 1 depending on the group is equivalent to the model with separate parameters for each of the two group means.</page>
<page dir='en/indicator' filePrefix='indicator3'>The least squares estimates for the GLM with an indicator variable give fitted values that are the two group means.</page>
<page dir='en/indicator' filePrefix='indicator4'>The t-test for whether the coefficient of the indicator variable is zero is identical to the standard t-test for comparing two sample means.</page>
<page dir='en/indicator' filePrefix='indicator5'>The explained sum of squares can be interpreted as the sum of squares between groups; the residual sum of squares is the sum of squares within groups.</page>
<page dir='en/indicator' filePrefix='indicator6'>The anova F test for equal group means gives the same p-value and conclusion as the standard t test.</page>
