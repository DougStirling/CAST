<page dir='en/diagnosticsTwo' filePrefix='diagnosticsTwo1'>Problems with the multiple regression model may relate to all data points, but sometimes only one or two data points cause problems.</page>
<page dir='en/diagnosticsTwo' filePrefix='diagnosticsTwo2'>Data points have high leverage if their values for the explanatory variables are 'unusual'.</page>
<page dir='en/diagnosticsTwo' filePrefix='diagnosticsTwo3'>Because high leverage points pull the least squares plane strongly, their residuals are rarely large, even if they are outliers.</page>
<page dir='en/diagnosticsTwo' filePrefix='diagnosticsTwo4'>Standardising the residuals adjusts for the lower residual standard deviation of high leverage points.</page>
<page dir='en/diagnosticsTwo' filePrefix='diagnosticsTwo5'>Ordinary standardised residuals often fail to highlight outliers that are high leverage points. Standardising with a deleted estimate of the error variance is best for detecting outliers.</page>
<page dir='en/diagnosticsTwo' filePrefix='diagnosticsTwo6'>Leverage depends only on the explanatory variables and describes the potential of a point to influence the results. DFITS and Cook's D describe the actual influence of each point.</page>
<page dir='en/diagnosticsTwo' filePrefix='diagnosticsTwo7'>The externally studentised residuals, leverages and DFITS provide a good guide to problems with individual points. Several examples are given.</page>
