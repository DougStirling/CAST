<page dir='en/regnProblem' filePrefix='regnProblem1'>The normal linear model involves assumptions of linearity, constant variance, normal error distribution and independence of different observations. Residuals can be examined to assess whether these assumptions are appropriate for a particular data set.</page>
<page dir='en/regnProblem' filePrefix='regnProblem2'>If the relationship between Y and X is nonlinear, a transformation of X may linearise the relationship.</page>
<page dir='en/regnProblem' filePrefix='regnProblem3'>Transforming the response may remove curvature in the relationship, but also affects whether the error standard deviation is constant. Fortunately, the same transformation of Y often removes curvature and non-constant standard deviation.</page>
<page dir='en/regnProblem' filePrefix='regnProblem4'>If a normal linear model describes the relationship between a transformation of the response and a transformation of the explanatory variable, predictions can be made by fitting the linear model to the transformed data, then performing the inverse transformation on the prediction.</page>
<page dir='bk/regn' filePrefix='regnProblem6'>The errors in a normal linear model are assumed to have normal distributions. Violation of this assumption is less important than nonlinearity, non-constant variance or outliers, but a probability plot of the residuals can be used to assess normality.</page>
<page dir='en/regnProblem' filePrefix='regnProblem7'>The errors in a normal linear model are assumed to be independent. In data where the observations are recorded sequentially, successive errors are sometimes found to be correlated. Correlated errors can arise whatever the x-variable, but are most often seen when the x-variable is time itself.</page>
