<page dir='en/regnInfTwo' filePrefix='regnInfTwo1'>Randomness can be modelled by assuming that the response has a normal distribution whose mean is a linear function of the explanatory variables and whose standard deviation is constant.</page>
<page dir='en/regnInfTwo' filePrefix='regnInfTwo2'>The normal linear model also implies that the least squares plane varies from sample to sample.</page>
<page dir='en/regnInfTwo' filePrefix='regnInfTwo3'>The least squares estimate of each coefficient has a normal distribution whose mean is the underlying population parameter.</page>
<page dir='en/regnInfTwo' filePrefix='regnInfTwo4'>The error variance is estimated by the sum of squared residuals divided by (n-3). The best estimate of the error standard deviation is the square root of this.</page>
<page dir='en/regnInfTwo' filePrefix='regnInfTwo5'>The standard deviation of each parameter estimate depends on the error standard deviation. Replacing this with an estimate allows us to find a 95% confidence interval. </page>
<page dir='en/regnInfTwo' filePrefix='regnInfTwo6'>A t test-statistic can be found by dividing a parameter estimate by its standard error. The p-value for testing whether the parameter is zero is the tail-area of a t distribution with (n-3) degrees of freedom.</page>
