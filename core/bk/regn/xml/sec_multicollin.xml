<section name='Multicollinearity of X and Z'>


<page dir='en/multicollin' filePrefix='multicollin1'>When the explanatory variables, X and Z, are correlated, their slope parameters can be estimated less accurately than for uncorrelated explanatory variables covering the same spreads of x- and z-values.</page>
<page dir='en/multicollin' filePrefix='multicollin2'>The variance inflation factors for the slope parameters quantify the increase in their standard errors due to the explanatory variables being correlated.</page>
<page dir='en/multicollin' filePrefix='multicollin3'>The slope coefficient for X is the slope of a slice through the regression plane at any z-value. When X and Z are highly correlated, similar slices of the data contain small ranges of x-values and therefore hold little information about the parameter.</page>
<page dir='en/multicollin' filePrefix='multicollin4'>The position of the least squares plane is most accurately determined near the data. When X and Z are highly correlated, the LS plane can be very variable away from the data.</page>
<page dir='en/multicollin' filePrefix='multicollin5'>If X and Z are correlated, the F-test can show that the explanatory variables are related to Y but t-tests of the separate slopes may show that either one of X or Z can be dropped from the full model.</page>
<page dir='en/multicollin' filePrefix='multicollin6'>If X and Z are correlated, the t-test for X in the full model with X and Z can give a different result from the t-test in the model with only the single explanatory variable X.</page>
