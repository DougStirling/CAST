<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile4" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile4">Given any target proportion, p, it is possible to find a corresponding value, x, for which approximately this proportion of values is x or lower. For example, the percentile for p = 50% is the median.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile5" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile5">The 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100'th percentiles are displayed as a box plot. Other percentiles can be displayed in a similar shaded rectangle.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="e_percentile6">Some exercises give practice at finding percentiles for a data set.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile6" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile6">Box plots are useful for comparing groups. If the groups are in order (e.g. the months of a year), the median, quartiles and extremes can be joined and shaded as bands. This effectively describe how the distribution of values varies.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile7" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile7">In some applications, different percentiles are important. They can also be joined and shaded as bands to compare ordered groups.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile8" note="Advanced" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile8">The graph of cumulative probabilities is a step function. Most software reports percentiles that are equivalent to reading values off a smoothed version of this step function.</page>
