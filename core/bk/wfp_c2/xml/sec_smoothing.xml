<page dir="en/smoothing" filePrefix="smoothing2" summaryDir="en/smoothing" summaryFilePrefix="s_smoothing2">When an even number of values is used for the moving averages, the smoothed values are at times half-way between those of the raw data. The method can be modified to give smoothed values at the times of the original values.</page>
<page dir="en/smoothing" filePrefix="smoothing3" note="Optional" summaryDir="en/smoothing" summaryFilePrefix="s_smoothing3">Using running medians instead of means avoids the effect of outliers, but the result often looks 'stepped'. The use of running medians, followed by running means, is a good compromise.</page>
<page dir="en/smoothing" filePrefix="smoothing4" summaryDir="en/smoothing" summaryFilePrefix="s_smoothing4">Exponential smoothing replaces each value with a weighted average of it and previous values. Unlike moving averages, it can be used right up to the end of the series.</page>
