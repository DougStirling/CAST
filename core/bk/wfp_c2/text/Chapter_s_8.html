<p class="heading">Different plotting symbols for a third variable</p>
	<p>The simplest way to show the relationship between <strong>three</strong> numerical variables is based on a scatterplot of two of the variables, with the third 
		variable being represented by  differing symbols instead of identical 
		'crosses'. Possibilities are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Colour</li>
		<li>Size</li>
		<li>Angle</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Although this kind of scatterplot is easy to draw, it is usually hard to 
		interpret. The decision about  which of the three variables to represent using 
				the plotting symbol  can make interpretation easier.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">8.1.2 &nbsp; Rotating 3D scatterplots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">3-dimensional scatterplots</p>
	<p>The most direct way to extend a standard scatterplot of two variables, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, to include a third variable, <em>Z</em>, is to add a third dimension to become an axis for <em>Z</em>. Each individual would be represented by a cross in a 3-dimensional cube.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/multivariate/images/s_3dScatter.gif" width="348" height="326"></p>
	<p>Although a computer screen is only 2-dimensional, it can display a projection of
		such a 3-dimensional scatterplot. Rotating such a display with the mouse gives a good
	feel for the shape of the underlying 3-dimensional scatter of points. This is a <strong>dynamic</strong> display that
	is only effective on a computer &mdash; the information in the display is conveyed by <strong>movement</strong>. On paper, we can only present information in two dimensions.</p>
	<p>Three-dimensional scatterplots are an interesting (and occasionally useful)
		way to display data. They are however <strong>much overrated</strong> as an analysis
		technique and simpler displays are usually
		more effective for extracting information from multivariate data.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">8.2.1 &nbsp; Scatterplot matrix and brushing</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Scatterplots of all pairs of variables</p>
	<p>The problem of displaying relationships becomes even more difficult when there
		are more than three variables. It is possible to gain some insight into their relationships 
		with an array of <strong>scatterplots of all pairs of variables</strong>, called a <strong> scatterplot matrix</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Brushing</p>
	<p>Although a <strong>static</strong>  scatterplot matrix reveals some aspects of 
		the relationships between the variables, more insight into the data is obtained 
		by adding <strong>dynamic</strong> features. </p>
	<p>On a computer display, the scatterplots can be dynamically linked, so that clicking on a cross on one
		scatterplot highlights that individual in <strong>all</strong> scatterplots.
		<strong>Brushing</strong> extends this to allow highlighting of multiple crosses on
	a scatterplot with a 'brush' tool. </p>

<h2 class="pageName">8.2.2 &nbsp; Slicing</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Slicing a scatterplot using a third variable</p>
	<p><strong>Slicing</strong> is a dynamic technique that only displays a subset of the individuals, based on a restricted range of values for one particular variable. For example, we might display a scatterplot of <em>Y</em> against <em>X</em>, but only for individuals whose values of <em>Z</em> are between 20 and 30. The subset can be dynamically changed with a slider or other control to show whether the relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> is different for individuals with low <em>Z</em> and high <em>Z</em>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Trellis plot</p>
	<p>Slicing is a dynamic method and must therefore be performed on a computer. Although less effective, an alternative is to show a series of static plots for different slices of the data. This is called a <strong>trellis plot</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">8.2.3 &nbsp; Scatterplot matrix with groups</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Distinguishing groups in a scatterplot matrix</p>
	<p>A scatterplot matrix can help to describe the relationships between 3 or more numerical variables. If each individual belongs to one of several known groups, different symbols or colours can be used to distinguish the groups.</p>
