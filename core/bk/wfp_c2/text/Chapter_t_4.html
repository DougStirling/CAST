<h1>Chapter 4 &nbsp; Proportions and Percentiles</h1>
<h2>4.1 &nbsp; Proportions</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 &nbsp; Illustrative data set</h3>
<p>A data set containing annual rainfalls in Samaru, Nigeria, will be used for illustrative purposes.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 &nbsp; Cumulative proportions</h3>
<p>Half the data are lower than the median. A quarter and three quarters are lower than the lower and upper quartiles. At any other value, x, the proportion of data values that are x or lower is called its cumulative proportion.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 &nbsp; Graph of cumulative proportions</h3>
<p>A graph of the cumulative proportion below x against x is a step function that increases from zero (at small x) to one (at high x).</p>
<h3>4.1.4 &nbsp; Other ways to express proportions</h3>
<p>Any cumulative proportion, p, can be equivalently expressed as a rate per n values, np, or as a percentage, 100p. If the proportion of values that are x or lower is p, the average number of values until one such value is obtained is 1/p; this is called the 'return period' for values less than or equal to x.</p>
<h3>4.1.5 &nbsp; Other data sets</h3>
<p>This page shows how cumulative proportions are used and interpreted for a few different data sets.</p>
<h3>4.1.6 &nbsp; Exercises based on real data</h3>
<p>Some exercises give practice at finding different ways to express proportions, based on real data sets.</p>
<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Percentiles</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Percentiles</h3>
<p>Given any target proportion, p, it is possible to find a corresponding value, x, for which approximately this proportion of values is x or lower. For example, the percentile for p = 50% is the median.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; Displaying percentiles</h3>
<p>The 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100'th percentiles are displayed as a box plot. Other percentiles can be displayed in a similar shaded rectangle.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; Percentiles</h3>
<p>Some exercises give practice at finding percentiles for a data set.</p>
<h3>4.2.4 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h3>
<p>Box plots are useful for comparing groups. If the groups are in order (e.g. the months of a year), the median, quartiles and extremes can be joined and shaded as bands. This effectively describe how the distribution of values varies.</p>
<h3>4.2.5 &nbsp; Comparing groups with other percentiles</h3>
<p>In some applications, different percentiles are important. They can also be joined and shaded as bands to compare ordered groups.</p>
<h3>4.2.6 &nbsp; Better definition of percentiles</h3>
<p>The graph of cumulative probabilities is a step function. Most software reports percentiles that are equivalent to reading values off a smoothed version of this step function.</p>
