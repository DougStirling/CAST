<p>This  CAST e-book has been designed to cover the statistical background needed for the projects in the first two years of the Bachelor of Engineering degree at Massey University.</p>
<p>The e-book uses data sets and scenarios from a wide range of applications 
of general interest. We have tried to use applications of relevance to engineering but others are from other areas of science or social sciences.</p>
  
<p>In some pages, you will notice a small triangle in the top right corner. This is a menu from which you can see  different versions of the page with perhaps biological or business  examples.</p>
