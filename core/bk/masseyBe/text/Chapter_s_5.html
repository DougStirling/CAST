<h1 class="sectionName">5.1 &nbsp; Association &amp; causal relationships</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">5.1.1 &nbsp; Interest in relationships</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>We are often interested in relationships between variables. The correlation between two numerical variables summarises their relationship; a contingency table  contains information about the relationship between two categorical variables.</p>
<p>When the individuals can be split into groups, a categorical variable can
be used to define group membership. Differences between the groups can then be
expressed as a relationship between the grouping variable and other variables.
The following questions are essentially asking the same in two different ways:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Do boys and girls aged 14 perform the same at maths?</dt>
	<dt>Is there a relationship between gender and mark in a maths test?</dt>
</dl>
<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
	evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>
	

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Relationships can be much harder to interpret than you might think</p>
</div></div>





<h2 class="pageName">5.1.2 &nbsp; Causal and non-causal relationships</h2>

<p>When two variables are related, we say that there is <strong>association</strong> between them.</p>
	<p class="heading">Causal relationships</p>
	<p>A <strong>causal relationship</strong> arises when we can conclude that one variable has a <strong>direct
influence</strong> on the other.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln1.gif" width="297" height="65"></p>
	<p class="heading">Non-causal relationships</p>
	<p>In non-causal relationships, the association between the two variables is not completely the result of 
		one variable directly affecting the other.</p>
	<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln2.gif" width="297" height="154"></td>
			<td><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln3.gif" width="297" height="120"></td>
			</tr>
	</table></div>
	<p>If two variables are <strong>not</strong> causally related, it is impossible 
		to tell whether changes to one variable, <em>X</em>, will result in changes to 
		the other variable, <em>Y</em>.</p>
	<p>The scatterplot below shows data from a sample of towns in a region. Neither variable directly affects the other. (The size of the towns is a lurking variable since larger towns have more churches and also more deaths.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/cancerChurch.gif" width="325" height="272"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Is a relationship causal?</p>
	<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
		the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
		adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change.</p>
	<p>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
	collected. <strong>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</strong></p>
	<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
	<p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables called <strong>lurking variables</strong> that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
  it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Individuals / units</p>
	<p>Most data sets consist of one or more values that are recorded from each of 
		a set of <strong>individuals</strong> (or plants, plots of land, repetitions of an experiment or 
		other 'units'). There are two different ways in which data can be collected from these units.</p>
<p class="heading">Types of data collection</p>
	<p>In an <strong>observational study</strong>, we passively 
		record (observe) values from each unit. Usually these units are sampled from some population.</p>
	<p>In an <strong>experiment</strong>, the researcher actively changes some characteristics 
		of the units before the data are collected. The values of some variables are therefore <strong>under the control of the experimenter</strong>. In other words, the experimenter 
		is able to <strong>choose</strong> each individual's values for some variables.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Observational studies and experiments</p>
	<p>The method of data collection has a major influence on whether a relationship 
		can be interpreted as causal.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Observational study</dt>
		<dd>There is usually the potential for a lurking 
				variable to underlie any observed relationship, so it is difficult to interpret 
		relationships.</dd>
		<dt>Experiment</dt>
		<dd>Provided the experiment has been designed well, there is little chance of lurking variables 
		driving the observed relationships, so any relationship will be causal.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>In a <strong>badly</strong> designed experiment however, lurking variables 
		can still cause difficulties in interpreting relationships.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">5.2 &nbsp; Sampling in practice</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">5.2.1 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h2>

<p class="heading">Estimation</p>
	<p>The aim of sampling is usually to <strong>estimate</strong> one or more population 
		values (parameters) from a sample. Because we do not have complete information about the population, the estimate is unlikely to be <strong>exactly</strong> same as the value that we are estimating, 
		so we call the difference the <strong>error</strong> in the estimate. There are 
		different kinds of error.</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling error</p>
	<p>Taking a random sample from a population involves randomness in the sample-selection process. The error caused by randomness in the sampling process is called <strong>sampling 
	error</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Non-sampling error</p>
	<p>When sampling from some types of population &mdash; especially human populations 
		&mdash; problems often arise when conducting one of the above sampling schemes. For 
		example, some sampled people are likely to refuse to participate in your study.</p>
	<p>Such difficulties also result in errors and these are called <strong>non-sampling 
		errors</strong>. Non-sampling errors can be much higher than sampling errors 
		and are much more serious. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike sampling errors, the likely size of non-sampling errors cannot be estimated 
			from a single sample &mdash; it is extremely difficult to assess their likely size.</li>
		<li>Non-sampling errors often distort estimates by pulling them in one direction. 
			The estimates are then called <strong>biased</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is therefore important to design a survey to minimise the risk of non-sampling 
		errors.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.2 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h2>

<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
	<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
		from some members of the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>
	<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
		the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
		the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
		only a subgroup of it.</p>
	<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>
	<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Failure to contact the individuals.</li>
		<li>Refusal to participate in the study.</li>
		<li>Refusal to answer particular questions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
		survey are likely to be biased.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.3 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h2>

<p class=heading>'Inaccurate' responses</p>
	<p>The next two types of non-sampling error are caused by inaccurate information 
		being obtained from the sampled individuals.</p>
	<p class=heading>Instrument error</p>
	<p><strong>Instrument error</strong> usually results from poorly designed
		questions. Different wording of questions can lead to different answers being 
		given by a respondent. The wording of the question may be such as to elicit some
		particular response (a <strong>leading</strong> question) or it may simply be carelessly
		worded so that it is misinterpreted by some respondents. </p>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer error</p>
	<p><strong>Interviewer error</strong> occurs when some characteristic of the interviewer, such
		as age or sex, affects the way in which respondents answer questions.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.4 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h2>

<p>There are various different ways to collect information from human populations. 
	Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
	<p class=heading>Telephone</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response can be high.</li>
		<li>Coverage error is small.</li>
		<li>The number of questions must be kept very small.</li>
		<li>Inexpensive, so sample sizes can be greater.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Mailed questionnaire</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response is very high.</li>
		<li>Costs are higher than in a telephone survey.</li>
		<li>Mailed questionnaires can contain more questions than telephone surveys.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lowest non-response and other sampling errors.</li>
		<li>Interviewers must be well trained to reduce interviewer error.</li>
		<li>Most expensive.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires can be fairly long.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Houses are rarely selected at random. Often streets are randomly selected and every
		5th or 10th house in the street is approached. This is called a <strong>systematic
			sample</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Street corner</p>
	<p>Some surveys are conducted by approaching people in busy shopping centres or
		similar public places. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Large coverage errors.</li>
		<li>Least expensive and therefore widely used.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires must be small.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To reduce coverage errors, a <strong>quota sample</strong> is often used. Each 
		interviewer is told to interview fixed numbers of old, young, male, female, etc. 
		respondents to match the 
		corresponding proportion in the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Self-selected</p>
	<p>Phone-in or mail-in surveys are often conducted by radio stations and magazines. The
		respondents are usually so unrepresentative that the results are meaningless. These types
		of survey should be avoided. </p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">5.3 &nbsp; Simple experiments</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">5.3.1 &nbsp; Experiments and treatments</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
	<p>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
	one or more explanatory variables.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
	<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
		Depending on the type of experiment, these units could be people, animals, trees, areas in a field, shops in a retail chain, ...</p>
	<p>In the experiments that we will examine here, a single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.</p>
	<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
	<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit. These controlled characteristics are  explanatory variables and are called <strong>factors</strong> in the context of an experiment. The different values 
		of the controlled characteristics are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>
	<p>The decision about which  treatment is applied to 
				each experimental unit is called the <strong>experimental 
	design</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="pageName">5.3.2 &nbsp; Variable experimental units</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Differences between experimental units</p>
	<p>In practice, it is usually impossible to conduct experiments with experimental units that are identical. The experimental units usually  have 
  characteristics that vary from unit to unit.</p>
	<p>These differences between the experimental units result in variability in the response measurements that are made from them, even if all receive the same treatment.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.3.3 &nbsp; A badly designed experiment</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Bad experimental design</p>
	<p>If the treatments are allocated to experimental units in a way that is associated with their naturally varying characteristics, the apparent relationship between the treatments and the response can be distorted.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/designIntro/images/lurking2.gif" width="297" height="120"></p>
	<p>This is similar to the effect of  lurking variables in observational studies.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_varyingUnits.gif" width="371" height="334"></p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Good experimental design can avoid the potential effect of lurking 
			variables.</p>
	</div></div>
	



<h2 class="pageName">5.3.4 &nbsp; Confounding</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Confounding</p>
	<p>The design of an experiment may make it <strong>impossible</strong> to 
		disentangle the effects of the treatment and other characteristics of the experimental uits. If the treatment is perfectly correlated with another 
		variable, the effects of the two variables <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished. 
	The treatment and variable are then said to be <strong>confounded</strong>.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>It is particularly important to avoid confounding in an experiment.</p></div></div>
	<p>In an experiment, <em>treatment A</em> was applied to 10 experimental units in 2010 and <em>treatment B</em> was used on 10 similar units in 2011.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_confounded.gif" width="340" height="134"></p>
	<p>It is <strong>impossible</strong> to tell whether the higher mean response for <em>treatment A</em> than <em>treatment B</em> was caused by the different treatments or other differences between the two years.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.3.5 &nbsp; Randomisation</h2>

<p class="heading">Avoiding lurking variables</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>An important goal of experimental design is to minimise association 
	between allocation of the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units.</p></div></div>
	<p>If the varying characteristics of the experimental units are understood and measured before the experiment is conducted, treatments can be allocated to ensure that there is no association. (See the later page about <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('designIntro7')">blocking in experiments</a>.)</p>
	<p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
	<p>When the differing characteristics of the experimental units are unmeasured, 
		 association between them and the treatments can be minimised by randomly 
		allocating treatments to the experimental units. This is called <strong>randomisation</strong> of the treatments and the experimental design is called a <strong>completely randomised 
			design</strong>. </p>
	<p>Randomisation does not <strong>guarantee</strong> that there will be no association 
		between the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units &mdash; by chance, 
		there may be some association. However...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Randomisation means that is unlikely that such lurking 
				variables will affect the conclusions.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Mechanics of randomisation</p>
	<p>The simplest way to randomise allocation of treatments to the experimental units is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Number the available experimental units from 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Find a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Allocate the treatments in order to the unit numbers given by the permutation.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Finding the random permutation is fairly easy in a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write the numbers 1 to <em>n</em> in a spreadsheet column</li>
		<li>Generate random numbers in an adjacent column &mdash; in Excel, type &quot;=RAND()&quot; in each cell.</li>
		<li>Select the two columns and use a menu command to sort the rows into ascending order of the random numbers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This gives a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_randomisation.gif" width="482" height="281"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.3.6 &nbsp; Replication</h2>

<p class="heading">Causes of variation</p>
	<p>In a completely randomised experiment,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some variation in the response measurements is caused by <strong>differences between the treatments</strong>. The experiment is conducted to discover the effect of the treatments.</li>
		<li><strong>Random variation</strong> is a catch-all that refers to all variation  that cannot 
		be explained in terms of the treatments.</li>
	</ul>
<p class="heading">Distinguishing the treatment effect and random variation</p>
	<p>To find the effect of the treatments on the response, it is essentionl that we can distinguish it from random 
	variation.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>There must be enough data to <strong>estimate random variation</strong> separately from variation caused by the treatments. </p>
	</div></div>
	<p><strong>Replication</strong> involves repeat measurements for each treatment. The variation <strong>within</strong> each treatment is all random variation.</p>
	<p>Understanding the amount of random variation is necessary before you can interpret the effect of the treatments.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_replication.gif" width="550" height="335"></p>
