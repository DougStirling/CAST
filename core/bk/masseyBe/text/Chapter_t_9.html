<h1>Chapter 9 &nbsp; Time Series</h1>
<h2>9.1 &nbsp; Time series plots</h2>
<h3>9.1.1 &nbsp; Time series plots</h3>
<p>A time series plot is similar to a scatterplot with 'time' as the variable on the horizontal axis. Successive values are usually joined by lines to emphasise systematic movements in the series.</p>
<h3>9.1.2 &nbsp; Patterns in time series</h3>
<p>A few examples show time series with trend, seasonal pattern and other oscillations.</p>
<h3>9.1.3 &nbsp; Multiple time series</h3>
<p>An example shows four different time series on the same graph.</p>
<h2>9.2 &nbsp; Smoothing</h2>
<h3>9.2.1 &nbsp; Moving averages</h3>
<p>Moving averages are a simple way to smooth out irregularities in a time series.</p>
<h3>9.2.2 &nbsp; More about moving averages</h3>
<p>When an even number of values is used for the moving averages, the smoothed values are at times half-way between those of the raw data. The method can be modified to give smoothed values at the times of the original values.</p>
<h3>9.2.3 &nbsp; Robust smoothing (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>Using running medians instead of means avoids the effect of outliers, but the result often looks 'stepped'. The use of running medians, followed by running means, is a good compromise.</p>
<h3>9.2.4 &nbsp; Exponential smoothing</h3>
<p>Exponential smoothing replaces each value with a weighted average of it and previous values. Unlike moving averages, it can be used right up to the end of the series.</p>
<h2>9.3 &nbsp; Long-term trend</h2>
<h3>9.3.1 &nbsp; Linear trend</h3>
<p>Many time series steadily increase or decrease over time and a linear model may describe the trend. This kind of model can be fitted by least squares.</p>
<h3>9.3.2 &nbsp; Quadratic trend</h3>
<p>If the trend is nonlinear, a quadratic model might describe the trend better and can also be fitted by least squares.</p>
<h3>9.3.3 &nbsp; Forecasting</h3>
<p>Linear and quadratic models can be used to forecast future values.</p>
<h3>9.3.4 &nbsp; Polynomial trend</h3>
<p>If a quadratic model does not adequately describe a nonlinear trend, it is possible to add higher powers of time to the model. These polynomial models may give a smooth picture of past trend but should not be used to forecast into the future.</p>
<h3>9.3.5 &nbsp; Detrending a time series</h3>
<p>Polynomial models are only useful to describe a smooth long-term trend in a time series. A time series plot of least squares residuals (actual values minus trend) highlights shorter-term movements in the series.</p>
