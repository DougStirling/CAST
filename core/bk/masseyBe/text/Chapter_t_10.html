<h1>Chapter 10 &nbsp; More Exploratory Graphics</h1>
<h2>10.1 &nbsp; Improved simple graphs</h2>
<h3>10.1.1 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h3>
<p>For some data sets, a basic stem and leaf plot groups the leaves into too many or too few classes (rows). To improve the presentation, each stem may be repeated either 2 or 5 times.</p>
<h3>10.1.2 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h3>
<p>If a histogram has varying class widths, the vertical axis must be 'density'. The histogram shape would be misleading if frequency or relative frequency was used for the vertical axis.</p>
<h3>10.1.3 &nbsp; Histogram areas and proportions</h3>
<p>The proportion of values in any classes always equals the proportion of the total histogram area that is above the classes.</p>
<h3>10.1.4 &nbsp; Displaying outliers</h3>
<p>The basic box plot is often modified to display outliers as separate crosses.</p>
<h3>10.1.5 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>Box plots cannot show clusters, so must never be used for data with clusters.</p>
<h3>10.1.6 &nbsp; Pareto diagrams</h3>
<p>If the categories in a bar chart have no natural ordering, it is often helpful to sort the categories into decreasing frequencies. If cumulative frequencies are also shown, the bar chart is called a Pareto diagram.</p>
<h2>10.2 &nbsp; Transformations</h2>
<h3>10.2.1 &nbsp; Linear transformations</h3>
<p>Linear transformations of data affect the scale on the axis of graphical displays, but do not otherwise change the shape of the distribution of values.</p>
<h3>10.2.2 &nbsp; Log transformations</h3>
<p>Nonlinear transformations change the shape of the distribution of values more profoundly. A logarithmic transformation can help detect patterns in very skew data sets.</p>
<h3>10.2.3 &nbsp; When to use log transform?</h3>
<p>Logarithmic transformations are most useful for 'quantity' data that cover several orders of magnitude.</p>
<h3>10.2.4 &nbsp; Power transformations</h3>
<p>Power transformations are a more flexible family of nonlinear transformations that are useful in data exploration.</p>
<h3>10.2.5 &nbsp; Power transforms &amp; skewness (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>The effect of power transformations on the skewness of data is evident in a wide range of graphical displays.</p>
<h2>10.3 &nbsp; Nonlinear relationships</h2>
<h3>10.3.1 &nbsp; Correlation and nonlinear relationships</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient is only a good measure of the strength of a relationship if the points in a scatterplot are scattered round a straight line, not a curve.</p>
<h3>10.3.2 &nbsp; Transformations and correlation</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient does not adequately describe the strength of a nonlinear relationship. Transforming the variables to linearise the relationship helps.</p>
<h3>10.3.3 &nbsp; Transformations and models</h3>
<p>If a relationship is nonlinear, a linear model can often be fitted to transformed response or explanatory variables.</p>
<h3>10.3.4 &nbsp; Quadratic models</h3>
<p>An alternative solution to nonlinearity is to fit a quadratic curve the data, again using the principle of least squares.</p>
<h3>10.3.5 &nbsp; Dangers of extrapolation</h3>
<p>Since the form of a relationship is unknown beyond the range of x-values in the data, it is always dangerous to extrapolate.</p>
<h3>10.3.6 &nbsp; Lowess smoothing of scatterplots (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>A nonlinear relationship can be summarised with a smooth curve based on fitting least squares lines to 'local' points.</p>
<h2>10.4 &nbsp; Displaying multivariate data</h2>
<h3>10.4.1 &nbsp; Representing a third variable</h3>
<p>A third numerical variable can be represented in a scatterplot by use of different symbols or colours.</p>
<h3>10.4.2 &nbsp; Rotating 3D scatterplots</h3>
<p>Three numerical variables can be displayed in a 3-dimensional scatterplot; this may be rotated to help understand the relationships in the data.</p>
<h3>10.4.3 &nbsp; Scatterplot matrix and brushing</h3>
<p>An array of scatterplots of all pairs of variables is often informative, especially if the scatterplots are dynamically linked.</p>
<h3>10.4.4 &nbsp; Brushing example</h3>
<p>'Brushing' refers to dynamic highlighting of the same individuals in multiple linked displays.</p>
<h3>10.4.5 &nbsp; Slicing</h3>
<p>Slicing is another dynamic technique. Only observations within a range of values of one variable (a slice) are displayed in linked displays.</p>
