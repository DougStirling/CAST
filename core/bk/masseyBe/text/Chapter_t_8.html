<h1>Chapter 8 &nbsp; Mastery Tests</h1>
<h2>8.1 &nbsp; Exercises for test 1</h2>
<h3>8.1.1 &nbsp; Draw a histogram</h3>
<p>This exercise gives you a sorted list of values and asks you to draw a histogram of the data set.</p>
<h3>8.1.2 &nbsp; Estimate proportion from histogram</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you are shown the histogram of a data set and are asked to estimate 'by eye' the proportion of values within some range.</p>
<h3>8.1.3 &nbsp; Interpret shape of stacked dot plot</h3>
<p>You are asked to interpret what the shape of a dot plot tells you about the data.</p>
<h3>8.1.4 &nbsp; Concepts of centre and spread</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you should summarise the difference between two distributions in terms of their different centres and spreads.</p>
<h3>8.1.5 &nbsp; Guess mean and median</h3>
<p>You are asked to estimate the mean and median from a stacked dot plot in this exercise.</p>
<h3>8.1.6 &nbsp; Guess SD from histogram</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for a rough 'guess' at the standard deviation of data sets from its histogram.</p>
<h3>8.1.7 &nbsp; Guess SD from general knowledge</h3>
<p>In this exercise, general knowledge about the type of measurement is enough to roughly guess the value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>8.1.8 &nbsp; Identify numerical and categorical variables</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will classify various measurements as numerical (continuous or discrete) or categorical (ordinal or nominal).</p>
<h3>8.1.9 &nbsp; Find percentage from a pie chart</h3>
<p>This exercise displays the pie chart for either an ordinal categorical variable or a categorical variable in which the categories have been arranged in decreasing order of their frequencies. You are asked to estimate the percentage in some adjacent categories 'by eye' from the pie chart.</p>
<h3>8.1.10 &nbsp; Match pie charts and bar charts</h3>
<p>Bar and pie charts display the same information in different ways. This exercise displays bar and pie charts for four data sets and asks you to match them.</p>
<h2>8.2 &nbsp; Exercises for test 2</h2>
<h3>8.2.1 &nbsp; Interpret scatterplot</h3>
<p>The exercise in this page expects you to interpret scatterplots in terms of the relationship between the variables, clusters and outliers.</p>
<h3>8.2.2 &nbsp; Guess correlation</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will make a rough estimate of correlation coefficient by eye from a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>8.2.3 &nbsp; Find equation of line</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page shows you a straight line and asks for its equation.</p>
<h3>8.2.4 &nbsp; Find a residual</h3>
<p>This exercise requests the least squares residual for a cross on a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>8.2.5 &nbsp; Interpret slope and intercept</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you are asked to select one of four statements that correctly describes the slope or intercept of a least squares line in the context of the data.</p>
<h3>8.2.6 &nbsp; Make prediction from LS line</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page gives a least squares line and asks for a prediction of the response, given the value of the explanatory variable.</p>
<h3>8.2.7 &nbsp; Identify problems with LS line</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to identify the difficulties with using the least squares line to predict Y at a given X from the data in a displayed scatterplot (an outlier, curvature, a high-leverage point or extrapolation).</p>
<h3>8.2.8 &nbsp; Identify patterns in a time series</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks you to identify whether a time series has trend, a seasonal pattern, a cyclic pattern or irregular variation.</p>
<h3>8.2.9 &nbsp; Find smoothed time series values</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to evaluate an exponentially smoothed value and a moving average.</p>
<h3>8.2.10 &nbsp; Find proportion from contingency table</h3>
<p>In this exercise you are shown contingency tables and asked to find a joint, marginal or conditional proportion.</p>
<h2>8.3 &nbsp; Exercises for test 3</h2>
<h3>8.3.1 &nbsp; Identify parameters and estimates</h3>
<p>This exercise asks whether three statements describe parameters or estimates.</p>
<h3>8.3.2 &nbsp; Find probability about cards or dice</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for probabilities about a card drawn at random from a standard pack of playing cards or when two dice are rolled.</p>
<h3>8.3.3 &nbsp; Probability when sampling with/without replacement</h3>
<p>This exercise relates to pairs of numbers drawn with or without replacement from a small finite population. The question asks for a probability about either the sum or difference of the two numbers.</p>
<h3>8.3.4 &nbsp; Identify binomial variables</h3>
<p>This exercise describes four random variables and asks which have binomial distributions.</p>
<h3>8.3.5 &nbsp; Find binomial prob from a barchart</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will use the information in the question to set the parameters of a binomial distribution then read off the probability by dragging over the bar chart of the binomial probabilities. (The computer does the calculations.)</p>
<h3>8.3.6 &nbsp; Find binomial prob using normal approx</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for probabilities relating to a binomial distribution but requires that you use a normal approximation to evaluate them.</p>
<h3>8.3.7 &nbsp; Find probability for non-normal pdf</h3>
<p>In this exercise, probabilities are obtained from the areas under a probability density function.</p>
<h3>8.3.8 &nbsp; Guess SD from normal pdf</h3>
<p>This exercise shows a normal distribution and asks you to guess its standard deviation.</p>
<h3>8.3.9 &nbsp; Find normal probability using z-score</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for a normal probability. It must first be translated into a question involving a z-score.</p>
<h3>8.3.10 &nbsp; Find a normal quantile</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page ask the inverse question; given a probability, what is the corresponding range of values? The exercise uses a normal table to find the answer.</p>
