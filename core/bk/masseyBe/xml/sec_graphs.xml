<page dir='en/graphs' filePrefix='graphs0'>This page is an overview of the section.</page>
<page dir='en/graphs' filePrefix='graphs1'>Information may be published in executive reports, for archival purposes or in documents for the general public. Publication is increasingly done electronically rather than on paper. Resolution, availability of colour, production cost and ease of formatting are issues that should be considered.</page>
<page dir='en/graphs' filePrefix='graphs2'>Reports generally only summarise the most important features of the available data. Identifying the important features is subjective and is similar to extracting the signal from a noisy electronic communication.</page>
<page dir='en/graphs' filePrefix='graphs3'>Reports should contain a balance of tables, graphs and text. Annotations on graphs can highlight important features.</page>
<page dir='en/graphs' filePrefix='graphs4'>Several simple graphs can sometimes be linked together in a single display. They should usually be either drawn on a common time axis or a map.</page>
<page dir='en/graphs' filePrefix='graphs5'>Most reports only contain simple graphs such as the general-purpose ones described in this chapter. More advanced graphs are needed to effectively display some specific types of data but they are generally too complex for reports intended for the general public.</page>
<page dir='en/graphs' filePrefix='graphs6'>Some excellent graphics have been devised to display particular data sets. There is still scope for innovation.</page>
