<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying  the chapter about probability.</p>
<p class="heading">1.1 Probability</p>
<p>The formal terminology for talking about randomness in page 1.1.2 is important to learn. You should also be able to work out probabilities relating to experiments with equally-likely outcome (page 1.1.4). The rest of this section is background information and will not be examined.</p>
<p class="heading">1.2 Probability calculations</p>
<p>This short chapter is important. You should know the three main axioms of probability (1.2.1), be able to use these axioms, along with set theory, to prove other results about probability (1.2.2) and apply the axioms to real-life examples (1.2.3).</p>
<p class="heading">1.3 Conditional probability</p>
<p>The concept and definition of conditional probability (1.3.1) and independence (1.3.6) are important. However you will not need to use Proportional Venn diagrams â€” they help to explain some results in this section but will not be examined. You should also understand the idea of partitions of the sample space (1.3.3).</p>
<p>When the randomness of a situation is described with conditional probabilities, you should be able to graph these in a tree diagram and use the tree diagram to work out other probabilities (1.3.4-5).</p>
<p>You should be able to apply the law of total probability (1.3.6) and Bayes theorem (1.3.7) to work out probabilities, but will not be asked to prove these two theorems. You may find it easier to answer questions involving these theorems from first principles rather than the theorems' formulae.</p>
