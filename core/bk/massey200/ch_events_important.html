<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the chapter about events in time.</p>
<p>From a described scenario, it is important that you can tell whether it involves events in time (this chapter) or a sequence of successes and failures (Chapter 3). If dealing with events in time, you must also be able to tell whether a random variable should be modelled by a Poisson, exponential or Erlang distribution.</p>
<p class="heading">6.1 Poisson distribution</p>
<p>You will need to understand the assumptions that underly a Poisson process and how the Poisson distribution arises, but will <strong>not</strong> need to derive the Poisson probability function or its mean and variance. You should also be able to justify the fact that the sum of independent Poisson variables also has a Poisson distribution, and use this to derive a normal approximation.</p>
<p>Maximum likelihood estimation of \(\lambda\) and a confidence interval for it are simply applications of the general results from Chapter 4.</p>
<p class="heading">6.2 Exponential distribution</p>
<p>You must understand how the exponential distribution relates to a homogeneous Poisson process and be able to derive its pdf. You should also be able to find the distribution's mean and variance. Maximum likelihood estimation of \(\lambda\) from an exponential sample and a confidence interval for it are simply applications of the general results.</p>
<p class="heading">6.3 Lifetimes</p>
<p>The definitions and meanings of the survivor and hazard functions are important and you should be able to prove that the hazard function is  constant if an item's lifetime has an exponential distribution.</p>
<p class="heading">6.4 Time until k'th event</p>
<p>You should know how the Erlang distribution arises but will not need to know how to derive its pdf. You should however be able to find the formulae for its mean and variance from those of the exponential distribution. After studying Section 7.3, you should be able to find probabilities relating to Erlang distributions on a computer (but not in the exam).</p>
