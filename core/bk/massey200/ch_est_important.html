<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying  the chapter about estimation.</p>
<p class="heading">4.1 Estimation</p>
<p>You need to know the definitions of an estimator's bias and standard error and how they are combined to give its mean squared error. All you need to know about consistency is that it arises when both the bias and standard error approach zero in large samples.</p>
<p class="heading">4.2 Method of moments</p>
<p>You should be able to apply the method of moments for estimation in any distribution with a single unknown parameter.</p>
<p class="heading">4.3 Maximum likelihood</p>
<p>This is a core section of the e-book. Many topics later in the course are based on the likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimation, so make sure that you thoroughly understand the concepts. You should be able to apply maximum likelihood to any distribution with a single unknown parameter.</p>
<p class="heading">4.4 Asymptotic properties of MLEs</p>
<p>You should remember that maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed, but the asymptotic formula for the variance in page 4.4.1 does not need to be remembered. What is more important is the method of finding the MLE's standard error on page 4.4.2 from the second derivative of the log-likelihood and you should be able to apply this to find the standard error of any single unknown parameter.</p>
<p class="heading">4.5 Numerical methods for MLEs</p>
<p>You should be able to apply the Newton-Raphson algorithm to find a parameter's maximum likelihood estimator and its standard error for any distribution.</p>
<p class="heading">4.6 Confidence intervals</p>
<p>Pages 4.6.1-2 are background (from 100-level statistics). Pages 4.6.3-4 are the core pages in this section â€” you should be able to evaluate an approximate confidence interval for any parameter (at any confidence level), based on a parameter estimate and its standard deviation.</p>
