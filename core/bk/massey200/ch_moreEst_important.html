<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the further material about estimation in this chapter.</p>
<p class="heading">9.1 Estimating two parameters</p>
<p>You should understand how the method of moments and maximum likelihood are extended for random samples from distributions with two unknown parameters. You should also be able to find the two equations that must be solved to obtain the method of moments estimates (equating the sample's and distribution's mean and variance) or the maximum likelihood estimates (differentiating the log-likelihood). If these equations cannot be solved algebraically, you should be able to perform a grid search to find the estimates (on a computer, not in the exam).</p>
<p class="heading">9.2 Confidence interval from pivots</p>
<p>You need to know how a pivot is defined and how to use it to obtain a confidence interval. Examples are given on pages 9.2.3-4 but you should be able to apply the method to any other distribution for which you can identify a pivot (or approximate pivot).</p>
