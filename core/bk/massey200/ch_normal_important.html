<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the  chapter about distributions related to the normal distribution.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>Remember that  the probability (or probability density) functions, means and variances of these distributions are provided in a formula sheet in the exam — you do not need to remember them.</p>
</div>
<p class="heading">10.1 Chi-squared distribution</p>
<p>You should be able to derive the pdf of a variable defined as the square of a standard normal variable — a &chi;&sup2;(1 df) distribution — and show that it is identical to that of a Gamma(&frac12;, &frac12;) distribution. You should also be able to derive the pdf of the sum of <em>k</em> such squared independent standard normal variables — a &chi;&sup2;(<em>k</em> df) distribution. The mean, variance and other properties of the distribution follow from those of the Gamma distribution.</p>
<p>You also need to know how the distribution of the sample variance from a normal distribution is related to a chi-squared distribution (but not prove it) and use this chi-squared distribution to obtain probabilities about sample variances and a confidence interval.</p>
<p class="heading">10.2 T distribution</p>
<p>You need to know how the t distribution is defined from a standard normal and an independent chi-squared variable. You should also be able to derive a pivot with a t distribution from the sample mean and variance of an arbitrary normal distribution and explain how this leads to the standard 100-level confidence interval for the normal distribution's mean.</p>
<p class="heading">10.3 F distribution</p>
<p>You should know how the F distribution is defined from two independent chi-squared variables. You also need to be able to find a pivot for the ratio of two independent sample variances and use it to evaluate a confidence interval for the ratio between the underlying population variances. You should also be able to prove that a squared variable with a t distribution has an F distribution.</p>
