<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the  material about testing hypotheses in this chapter.</p>
<p class="heading">11.1 Hypothesis test concepts</p>
<p>The first section of this chapter summarises the general methodology that is used for testing hypotheses and should already be understood from 100-level statistics.</p>
<p class="heading">11.2 Goodness of fit tests</p>
<p>You should be able to prove that the sum of squared independent standardised Poisson random variables has approximately a chi-squared distribution. You should also be able to use this to conduct a test about whether a set of counts arises from a particular Poisson model, and tests about parameters of other distributions based on frequency tables.</p>
<p class="heading">11.3 Tests about normal distributions</p>
<p>Pages 11.3.1, 11.3.2 and 11.3.4 explain how to apply the general methodology of hypothesis testing to the means of normal distributions. (These methods were described in 100-level statistics papers, but you should now be able to explain how the tests for a single mean arise.) You should also be able to derive the tests for a single normal variance and comparison of two variances, and apply them to real data sets.</p>
<p class="heading">11.4 Fixed significance level</p>
<p>You need to understand the use of fixed significance levels in hypothesis testing (page 11.4.1). Read the rest of this chapter, but it will not be examined.</p>
<p class="heading">11.5 Likelihood ratio test</p>
<p>It is important to understand the concept of big and small models and identify them for specific hypothesis tests. You will also need to apply the likelihood ratio test for such hypotheses.</p>
<p class="heading">11.6 CI from inverting a test</p>
<p><strong>This chapter is the hardest in the course</strong> but is important because it does provide some useful methods. You should understand the strong relationship between pivots and test statistics for a parameter, and hence the relationship between 2-tailed hypothesis tests at fixed significance level and confidence intervals (page2 11.6.1-2).</p>
<p>The three examples of finding confidence intervals based on hypothesis tests in pages 11.6.3-5 should be understood and you should be prepared to use similar methods to find confidence intervals for other scenarios. </p>
