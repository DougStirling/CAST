<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the chapter about flexible models.</p>
<p>This chapter describes a few distributions that may be able to model data when the distributions in Chapters 3 and 6 either cannot be justified or simply do not fit the data. From a textual description of how a random variable arises, you should be able to find a distribution that might be suitable to model it — either a distributions from Chapters 3 and 6 or one of the distributions in this chapter.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>Remember that  the probability (or probability density) functions, means and variances of these distributions are provided in a formula sheet in the exam — you do not need to remember them.</p></div>

<p class="heading">7.1 Overdispersion of counts</p>
<p>You should understand how overdispersion might arise in a Poisson process and will result in a variance that is greater than would otherwise arise. Recognise that the generalised negative binomial distribution might be flexible enough to model this, but you will <strong>not</strong> be required to derive its mean and variance or show that the Poisson distribution is a special case.</p>
<p>In a similar way, you should understand how overdispersion might arise in a sequence of successes and failures, giving rise to data that are more variable than a sample from a binomial distribution. You should understand how this might arise but will <strong>not</strong> need to use the beta-binomial distribution to model it.</p>
<p class="heading">7.2 Varying hazard rate</p>
<p>You should recognise that the exponential distribution is only appropriate for an item's lifetime if its hazard rate is constant. You should be able to prove that the Weibull distribution results in a distribution whose hazard rate varies as a power of time. You should also be able to derive the mean and variance of the distribution and verify the formula for its cumulative distribution function.</p>
<p class="heading">7.3 Gamma distribution</p>
<p>A random variable whose values <strong>must</strong> be positive might be modelled by the exponential distribution, but the gamma distribution is a more flexible distribution for these situations. You should be able to derive the mean and variance of the distribution but a computer is needed to evaluate probabilities for it. You should also be able to prove that the Erlang distribution is a special case and be able to prove that its shape approaches a normal distribution as its first parameter increases.</p>
<p class="heading">7.4 Beta distribution</p>
<p>You should recognise that beta distributions are possible models for continuous variables whose values must lie between zero and one, but will not need to know how to calculate the distribution's mean and variance.</p>
<p class="heading">7.5 Normal distribution</p>
<p>This section provides a theoretical explanation for the methods that you learned about normal distributions in 100-level statistics. Sections 7.5.1-5 do not introduce anything new that must be learned and you should already know how to use z-scores to find normal probabilities and quantiles. You should however be able to apply the results in page 7.5.6 to find probabilities for variables that are defined as linear combinations of normal variables. The independence of the  mean and variance of a random sample (page 7.5.7) will be referred to in a later chapter, but you will not need to use it otherwise.</p>
