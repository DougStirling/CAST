<p>This  CAST e-book has been designed for the paper <em>161.200 Statistical Models</em> at Massey University.</p>
	
  <p>Statistics is a practical discipline that attempts to answer real-life questions about problems in a variety of application areas, based on relevant data. Many statistical courses focus on the statistical methods that are used to analyse such data, but these statistical methods are underpinned by a body of theory that explains<strong> why</strong> they work.</p>
  <p>Statistical theory  explains the circumstances in which 'standard' statistical methods  work, and when they are likely to break down or be misleading. The theory also provides techniques that might be used to <strong>extend</strong> standard statistical methods when the assumptions underlying them are violated.</p>
  <p>Mathematics is used to describe statistical theory. In particular, a sound background in algebra and calculus (differentiation and integration) is required before attempting to study this e-book.</p>
<p class="heading">What you will need to learn</p>
<p>It is important for you to understand that:</p>
<div class="centred">
	<div class="boxed">
		<p>You <strong>do not</strong> need to master <strong>everything</strong> in this e-book for the paper 161.200.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>In particular,</p>
<ul>
	<li>We have included  material that gives background to some topics and should help your general understanding but will not be examined.</li>
	<li>Proofs of some results are given  for completeness but are quite complex and can be ignored.</li>
	<li>There are a few topics, especially at the end of the e-book, that are too advanced  for this paper but have been included as optional reading for those who want to look at some extension material.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each chapter, we will try to indicate what is most important and what you should be able to do.</p>
<p class="heading">Formulae</p>
<p>Finally, note that most of the formulae used in this e-book will be provided in a formula sheet attached to the final exam paper so you do not need to spend time memorising them. The formula sheet can be downloaded from our Stream site.</p>
