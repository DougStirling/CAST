<p>Up to this point in the e-book, we have only considered either single random variables or random samples (several random variables that are independent).</p>
<p>This chapter generalises to situations involving two random variables, but where the variables might be related — knowing the value of X might give information about the distribution of Y.</p>
<p>The chapter starts with  some general theory about bivariate discrete and continuous distributions. Two important distributions for dependent random variables are then introduced.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The multinomial distribution is a generalisation of the binomial distribution to situations that allow more than two possible outcomes (success and failure) from each trial.</li>
	<li>The bivariate normal distribution plays the same role for two continuous random variables that the univariate normal distribution does for a single variable. It is the most commonly encountered bivariate distribution.</li>
</ul>
<div class="boxed" style="background-color:yellow;">
	<p>Although this chapter covers both discrete and continuous bivariate distributions, the material dealing with continuous random variables is mathematically difficult and will not be examined (other than the bivariate normal distribution in section 6).</p>
	<p style="color:red;">What should be studied is described in each section — the remaining material should only be studied by those of you who are more mathematically inclined.</p>
