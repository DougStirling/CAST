<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the chapter about transformations.</p>
<p class="heading">8.1 General methods</p>
<p>When a random variable is defined as a function of one or more other variables, you can sometimes find its cumulative distribution function from first principles. If so, you should be able to find its probability density function by differentiating it. When <em>Y</em> is a monotonic function of <em>X</em>, you should be able to derive the simpler formula relating their two pdfs and apply it.</p>
<p>You should also know how to transform any random variable into a rectangular one and vice versa, though the proof will not be examined. This is the basis of computer simulations.</p>
<p class="heading">8.2 Linear transformations</p>
<p>You should be able to derive the formulae for the mean and variance of a linear transformation of <em>X</em>, both for discrete and continuous random variables, and apply the result to problems. You should also be able to find the pdf of such linear transformations.</p>
<p class="heading">8.3 Delta method</p>
<p>If <em>Y</em> is a monotonic transformation of <em>X</em>, you should be able to use the delta method to find  approximate values for the mean and variance of <em>Y</em> from those of <em>X</em>. (Proofs of the general result will not be examined however.)</p>
