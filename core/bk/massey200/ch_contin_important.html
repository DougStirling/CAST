<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the chapter about continuous random variables.</p>
<p class="heading">5.1 Finding probabilities</p>
<p>For any continuous distribution, you should be able to find probabilities (including cumulative ones) by integration. You should also be able to find any quantile (or at least the equation that must be solved to find it).</p>
<p>The relationship between the pdf and cumulative distribution function through integration and differentiation is also important and will be used later in the e-book.</p>
<p class="heading">5.2 Mean and variance</p>
<p>You should be able to find the mean,  variance and any other expected value for a continuous random variable (by integration).</p>
<p class="heading">5.3 Random samples</p>
<p>The details of this section will not be  examined. All you need to know is that the results about sample means and variances for discrete random variables (section 2.3) also hold for continuous variables (page 5.3.2).</p>
<p class="heading">5.4 Estimating parameters</p>
<p>In a similar way, this section mainly states that all results and methods given in Chapter 4 for discrete random variables can also be used in the same way for continuous ones. (The continuous distribution's pdf is used in the same way as a discrete distribution's probability function, as justified on page 5.3.1.)</p>
<p>You should now be able to find method of moments and maximum likelihood estimators for  continuous distributions that have a single unknown parameter, and find standard errors and confidence intervals when MLE is used. You should also be aware the likelihood cannot <strong>always</strong> be maximised by differentiating the log-likelihood â€” page 5.4.7 gives an example.</p>
