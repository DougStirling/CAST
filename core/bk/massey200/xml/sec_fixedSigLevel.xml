<topText><![CDATA[<p>This section will not be examined. Hypothesis tests are usually conducted by interpreting p-values. However test results are sometimes reported as accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis at fixed significance levels and this section examines consequences of that approach.</p>]]></topText>

<page dir="en/fixedSigLevel" filePrefix="fixedSigLevel1" summaryDir="en/fixedSigLevel" summaryFilePrefix="s_fixedSigLevel1" videoDir="en/fixedSigLevel" videoFilePrefix="v_fixedSigLevel1">Hypothesis tests are often based on interpreting a p-value. An alternative approach involves a decision that is made about which of the two hypotheses is true. The significance level is the probability of wrongly concluding that the null hypothesis is not true.</page>
<page dir="en/fixedSigLevel" filePrefix="fixedSigLevel2" note="Optional (not examined)#(Opt)" summaryDir="en/fixedSigLevel" summaryFilePrefix="s_fixedSigLevel2">Two types of error can be made from a test; deciding that H₀ is true when it is false, and deciding it is false when it is true.</page>
<page dir="en/fixedSigLevel" filePrefix="fixedSigLevel3" note="Optional (not examined)#(Opt)" summaryDir="en/fixedSigLevel" summaryFilePrefix="s_fixedSigLevel3">A test with significance level α can be based on the test's p-value. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is less than α.</page>
<page dir="en/fixedSigLevel" filePrefix="fixedSigLevel4" note="Optional (not examined)#(Opt)" summaryDir="en/fixedSigLevel" summaryFilePrefix="s_fixedSigLevel4">For discrete data, it is usually impossible to find a decision rule with significance level exactly 5% (or any other pre-specified value). A conservative test uses a significance level that is just under the required value.</page>
<page dir="en/fixedSigLevel" filePrefix="fixedSigLevel5" note="Optional (not examined)#(Opt)" summaryDir="en/fixedSigLevel" summaryFilePrefix="s_fixedSigLevel5">The power of a test is the probability of accepting H₀ when it is false. Since this usually depends on the actual parameter value, it is a function that can be graphed.</page>
<page dir="en/fixedSigLevel" filePrefix="fixedSigLevel6" note="Optional (not examined)#(Opt)" summaryDir="en/fixedSigLevel" summaryFilePrefix="s_fixedSigLevel6">If a hypothesis test's significance level and its power at some value of the parameter are specified, the sample size can be determined to achieve this.</page>
