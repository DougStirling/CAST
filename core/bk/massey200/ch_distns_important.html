<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying  the chapter about random variables.</p>
<p class="heading">2.1 Discrete random variables</p>
<p>The distinction between discrete and continuous random variables is central to the course, so you must be able to identify which is relevant to any scenario. The idea of a probability function and its properties should be understood (2.1.1). From any probability function, you should be able to find any probability, including cumulative probabilities, by summing its probability function (2.1.2).</p>
<p>You should also be able to find the mean and variance  for  a discrete random variable described by a table of probabilities or the mathematical formula for its probability function (2.1.3 and 2.1.5). You should also be able to use the results in page 2.1.4 to find other expected values and prove the alternative formula for the variance.</p>
<p class="heading">2.2 Continuous random variables</p>
<p>This section is a brief introduction to continuous random variables that is only used to introduce the normal distribution here. (Chapter 5 goes into a lot more detail.) At this point, you only need to understand how a probability density function describes a continuous random variable's probabilities as areas under it (2.2.1-2), and know that a variable's mean and variance are interpreted in a similar way to those of a discrete random variable (2.2.3).</p>
<p>From 100-level statistics, you should already know how the shape of the normal distribution depends on its parameters &mu; and &sigma;&sup2; and be able to find probabilities for specific normal random distributions.</p>
<p class="heading">2.3 Discrete random samples</p>
<p>You should understand the concept of two or more independent discrete random variables and its precise definition (2.3.1-2) and be able to derive the formulae for the mean and variance of (<em>aX</em>+<em>bY</em>) when <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are independent (2.3.3).</p>
<p>You should also be able to derive the formulae for the mean and variance of the sum and mean of the values in a random sample (2.3.4), and know that the Central Limit Theorem justifies their approximately normal distribution in large samples (2.3.5).</p>
<p class="heading">2.4 Uniform distribution</p>
<p>The discrete uniform distribution is mainly introduced here as a simple example to illustrate the earlier results. You will <strong>not</strong> be asked to derive the formulae for its mean and variance but could be asked to find probabilities about the mean of a random sample, using a normal approximation based on the Central Limit Theorem.</p>
