<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the   chapter about multivariate distributions.</p>
<div class="boxed" style="background-color:yellow;">
	<p style="color:red;">Although this chapter covers both discrete and continuous bivariate distributions, the material about continuous random variables will not be examined (other than the bivariate normal distribution in section 6).</p>
</div>
<p class="heading">12.1 Discrete bivariate distributions</p>
<p>You should know the concepts of joint, marginal and conditional probability functions for a bivariate discrete distribution and be able to find them for different problems. (Three-dimensional bar charts may help understanding but are not essential.) Independent random variables and random samples were described earlier in Section 2.3.</p>
<p class="heading">12.2 Continuous bivariate distributions</p>
<p>The concept of probabilities being defined as volumes under a surface is important. However you will <strong>not</strong> be expected to evaluate such volumes, either geometrically or by double integration. You should understand that a marginal pdf is found from cross-sectional areas of the joint pdf, and conditional pdfs have the shape of the cross-sections themselves, but what is important is that these are similar concepts to those for discrete bivariate distributions.</p>
<p class="heading">12.3 Expected values</p>
<p>The concept of expected values in bivariate contexts is similar to the expected value of a function of a single random variable. However you will only be examined about expected values for discrete bivariate distributions.</p>
<p class="heading">12.4 Covariance and correlation</p>
<p>The concept of covariance is important but is only described here since the correlation coefficient is defined from it. You should know the properties of the correlation coefficient and how it describes the strength of the relationship between two random variables but will not be asked for proofs.</p>
<p class="heading">12.5 Multinomial distribution</p>
<p>You should be able to recognise when a set of discrete variables has a multinomial distribution and find joint probabilities. You should also be able to find the marginal and conditional distributions  and find probabilities from them. The means and variances of the individual variables follow easily from their marginal binomial distributions, but you should also be able to find the correlation coefficient between any two variables.</p>
<p class="heading">12.6 Bivariate normal distribution</p>
<p>You should read the whole section to get an understanding of the shape of this distribution. However the exam will only ask questions such as that in page 12.6.6 that provide a bivariate normal distribution's parameters and ask you to find marginal and conditional distributions and probabilities.</p>
