<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Events in Time</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Poisson distribution</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Poisson process</h3>
<p>The simplest model for events in time is a homogeneous Poisson process in which events occur singly at a constant rate over time, λ, with events in non-overlapping time periods independent.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Events in fixed time (Proof not examined)</h3>
<p>The number of events in a Poisson process over a fixed period of time has a Poisson distribution. It can be found as a limit of binomial distributions.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; Poisson probability function</h3>
<p>The Poisson distribution's probability function is given and some properties are described.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Mean and variance (Proof not examined)</h3>
<p>A Poisson distribution's mean and variance both equal λ. The distribution's shape is close to a normal distribution when λ is large.</p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; Example</h3>
<p>A few probabilities relating to Poisson distributions are calculated here.</p>
<h3>6.1.6 &nbsp; Maximum likelihood</h3>
<p>The maximum likelihood estimate of the Poisson parameter, λ, is the sample mean.</p>
<h3>6.1.7 &nbsp; Confidence interval for rate</h3>
<p>The standard error of the maximum likelihood estimator is derived and a confidence interval for the parameter, λ, is found from it.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Exponential distribution</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Time until first event</h3>
<p>The time until the first event of a homogeneous Poisson process has an exponential distribution. Its pdf is derived.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Other exponential probabilities</h3>
<p>The exponential distribution has a 'memoryless' property — knowing that there were no events up to time t gives no information about when events will happen in the future.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Gamma functions</h3>
<p>This page describes some properties of gamma functions, a generalisation of factorials. Gamma functions will be used later in the e-book.</p>
<h3>6.2.4 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>The exponential distribution's mean and variance are derived.</p>
<h3>6.2.5 &nbsp; Maximum likelihood</h3>
<p>The maximum likelihood estimate of the exponential distribution's parameter, λ, is the inverse of the sample mean.</p>
<h3>6.2.6 &nbsp; Confidence intervals</h3>
<p>An approximate formula for the standard error of the MLE of λ is derived and used to find a confidence interval.</p>
<h2>6.3 &nbsp; Lifetimes</h2>
<h3>6.3.1 &nbsp; Survivor and hazard functions</h3>
<p>If X is the lifetime of an item, its survivor function is S(x) = P(X > x). Its hazard function, h(x), describes the momentary risk of dying, conditional on having survived until time x.</p>
<h3>6.3.2 &nbsp; Relationship to Poisson process</h3>
<p>If an item's lifetime corresponds to the first event in a homogeneous Poisson process, its lifetime distribution is exponential and its hazard rate is constant.</p>
<h2>6.4 &nbsp; Time until k'th event</h2>
<h3>6.4.1 &nbsp; Erlang distribution (Proof not examined)</h3>
<p>The time until the k'th event in a homogeneous Poisson process has an Erlang distribution; its probability density function is derived.</p>
<h3>6.4.2 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>The sum of k independent exponential random variables has an Erlang distribution. This is used to derive the distribution's mean and variance.</p>
<h3>6.4.3 &nbsp; Probabilities</h3>
<p>The Erlang distribution is a special case of the Gamma distribution. The way to find probabilities for it will be described for the Gamma distribution in the next chapter.</p>
