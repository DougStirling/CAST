<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Random Variables</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Discrete random variables</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Discrete distributions</h3>
<p>A discrete random variable is usually one that can only take integer values — counts of something. Its distribution is fully described by the probabilities for these values, the variable's probability function.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Cumulative distribution function</h3>
<p>The cumulative distribution function of a random variable, F(x), is the probability of getting a value less than or equal to x. For a discrete random variable, this is a step function.</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Mean</h3>
<p>A discrete random variable's mean is defined in a similar way to that of a discrete data set.</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Expected values</h3>
<p>The concept and definition of a variable's mean can be generalised to give the expected value of any function of its value.</p>
<h3>2.1.5 &nbsp; Variance</h3>
<p>A random variable's variance is the expected value of the squared distance to its mean. This summarises the spread of values in the distribution.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Continuous random variables</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h3>
<p>A continuous random variable's distribution is described by a type of histogram with infinitely narrow classes, called the variable's probability density function.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Probability and area</h3>
<p>The probability of a value within any range equals the probability density function's area above these values.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>The mean and variance of a continuous random variable are interpreted in a similar way to those of continuous variables, but are defined using integrals instead of summations.</p>
<h3>2.2.4 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h3>
<p>A particularly important type of continuous distribution is the family of normal distributions. These are symmetric distributions whose centre and spread are described by two parameters, μ and σ.</p>
<h3>2.2.5 &nbsp; Important normal quantiles</h3>
<p>A normal random variable has 90% probability of being within 1.645σ of μ, 95% probability of being within 1.96σ of μ, and 99% probability of being within 2.576σ of μ.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Discrete random samples</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; Independence</h3>
<p>Two discrete random variables, X and Y, are independent if all events relating to the value of X are independent of events about Y.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Random samples</h3>
<p>A random sample from a distribution is a collection of independent random variables, each of which has this distribution.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Functions of two variables</h3>
<p>Formulae are given for the mean and variance of a linear function of two independent random variables.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 &nbsp; Properties of sums and means</h3>
<p>The sum of values in a random sample is a random variable. Formulae for its mean and variance are given and similar formulae for the sample mean are also given.</p>
<h3>2.3.5 &nbsp; Central limit theorem</h3>
<p>The sum and mean of a random sample from a normal distribution both have normal distributions. For random samples from other distributions, the sum and mean have distributions that become close to normal as the sample size increases.</p>
<h2>2.4 &nbsp; Uniform distribution</h2>
<h3>2.4.1 &nbsp; Family of uniform distributions</h3>
<p>A random variable with equal probabilities for all integer values within some range, has a discrete uniform distribution.</p>
<h3>2.4.2 &nbsp; Mean and variance (Proof not examined)</h3>
<p>Formulae are given for the mean and variance of the discrete uniform distribution.</p>
<h3>2.4.3 &nbsp; Sample mean</h3>
<p>The distribution of the sample mean from a uniform distribution is found and shown to be close to a normal distribution when the sample size is large. </p>
