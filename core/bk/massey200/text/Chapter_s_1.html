<h2 class="pageName">1.1.1 &nbsp; Uncertainty and Probability</h2>
<p>There are many situations in which we do not know precisely what will happen. Even when the mechanism underlying the situation is deterministic, limited knowledge means that  there is no choice but to treat the outcome as being random.</p>
<p>Uncertainty is described by the <strong>probabilities</strong> of the different possible events that might occur. Probability is a value that describes chance on a scale of zero to one.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.1.2 &nbsp; Terminology</h2>
<p>Although there are many different situations involving randomness, it is convenient to use a general terminology that can cover them all.</p>

<p class="heading">Links to set theory</p>

<p>These definitions are closely associated with set theory. Although the ideas behind probability can be understood without it, a formal definition of probability and its rules uses set theory. The following table links probability notation with set theory:</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.1.3 &nbsp; Classical definition of probability</h2>

<p class="heading">Equally likely outcomes</p>

<p>There are some kinds of experiment where we believe that all possible outcomes have the same chance of arising. This is usually justified by symmetry in the physical mechanism underlying the experiment. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tossing a coin — a head and a tail are equally likely.</li>
	<li>Picking a card from a shuffled deck — all 52 cards are equally likely.</li>
	<li>Drawing the winning ticket in a lottery — all tickets have the same chance of being picked.</li>
</ul>

<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>If an experiment has \(N\) equally likely outcomes and an event, \(E\), consists of \(x\) of them, then  its probability  is defined to be</p>
\[P(E) = \frac x N\]
</div>

<p>In other words,</p>
\[P(event) = \frac {\text{Number of outcomes in } event} {\text{Number of outcomes in  sample space}}\]

<p>This is called the <strong>classical</strong> definition of probability and is the easiest to understand.</p>
<p class="heading">Sampling a value from a finite population</p>
<p>Many applications with equally likely outcomes involve games of chance such as cards, dice and roulette wheels.</p>
<p>However equally likely outcomes  also arise when sampling a value from a finite population. If  all population members have the same chance of selection, then this definition of probability can again be used.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Household size in Mauritius</p>
	<p>The following bar chart describes the size of all households in Mauritius in its 2011 census.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probDefinitions/images/s_mauritiusHouseholds.png" width="483" height="321" alt=""/></p>
	<p>The probability that a randomly chosen household is of any size is the proportion of such households in the census.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="pageName">1.1.4 &nbsp; Applications of classical definition</h2>
<p>If all outcomes are equally likely, calculating the probabilities of  events involves counting outcomes — both counting the outcomes in the event itself and those in the sample space. The following result is often useful.</p>

	<div class="theorem">
		<p class="theoremTitle">Mathematical result (should be known from maths)</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.1.5 &nbsp; Probability from relative frequency</h2>

<p class="heading">Repeatable experiments</p>

<p>In practice, experiments rarely have outcomes that we can argue must be equally likely. In any such experiment, a different definition must be used for the probability of an event.</p>
<p>We can often imagine repeating the experiment many times. If the experiment is repeated indefinitely in essentially the same way, the probability of an event can be defined as the long-term proportion of times that it occurs.</p>

<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
	<p>If an experiment could be repeated in essentially the same way again and again, then  the probability of any event, \(E\), is defined to be the limiting proportion of times that the event occurs as the number of repetitions increases.</p>
\[P(E) = \lim_{\text {repetitions} \to \infty} (\text {proportion of times } E \text { occurs})\]
</div>
<p>The next diagram illustrates.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/s_largeNos.gif" width="493" height="308"></p>
<p class="heading">Consistency with earlier definition</p>
<p>A theorem called the <strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong>  proves that this definition is consistent with the definition that we gave earlier for experiments with equally likely outcomes. If the probability of an event is \(p\) (using the classical definition) and the experiment is repeated indefinitely, the limiting proportion of times that the event occurs is <strong>always</strong> \(p\).</p>


<h2 class="pageName">1.1.6 &nbsp; Estimating probabilities</h2>
<p>The probability of an event can be defined as the long-term proportion of times that it occurs when the experiment is repeated. Unfortunately, although this explains the <strong>concept</strong> of the event's probability, it <strong>does not provide a numerical value</strong> in practice — the experiment cannot be repeated an infinite number of times.</p>
<p>However although we cannot repeat the experiment an <strong>infinite</strong> number of times, the proportion of times that the event occurs in a <strong>large</strong> number of repetitions will give an <strong>approximate</strong> value for the probability — an <strong>estimate</strong> of its value.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.1.7 &nbsp; Subjective probability</h2>

<p class="heading">Unrepeatable experiments</p>
<p>In most scientific contexts, it is possible to imagine repeating an experiment in essentially the same way. However there are other scenarios in which such repetitions are clearly impossible, but there is still uncertainty about the outcome. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is a person on trial for a crime actually guilty of it?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no equally likely outcomes and the &quot;experiment&quot; cannot be repeated. Instead, a <strong>subjective</strong> or <strong>personal</strong> assessment of probability must be made.</p>
<p class="heading">Subjective probability</p>
<p>Subjective probability can be given a formal definition, based on what you would regard as a 'fair bet' for the event. If either of the earlier definitions of its probability  can be used, this results in the same numerical value, <strong>provided it is applied by a 'reasonable' person with full knowledge of the experiment's structure</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Bayesian statistics</p>
<p>A whole field of statistics called <em><strong>Bayesian statistics</strong></em> is based on subjective probabilities and is gaining in importance</p>
<p>However we will neither deal with subjective probability nor Bayesian statistics further in this e-book.</p>


<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">1.2 &nbsp; Probability calculations</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.2.1 &nbsp; Core rules of probability</h2>

<p class="heading">Mutually exclusive events</p>
<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>Two events, \(A\) and \(B\) are called <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> if they have no outcomes in common. More precisely, using set notation, this is when</p>
\[
A \cap B = \emptyset
\]
</div>

<p>In other words, \(A\) and \(B\) are called mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.</p>
<p class="heading">Properties of probability</p>
<p>In 1933,  Kolmogorov published a paper basing the 'theory' of probability to a small number of axioms that hold for <strong>all</strong> definitions of probability. Anything derived from these axioms also holds, no matter how probability is defined, so we no longer need to distinguish between the different definitions in the last section.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class='definitionTitle'>Axioms of probability</p>
<ol>
	<li>P(S) = 1       where <em>S</em> is the sample space</li>
	<li>0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1        for any event, E</li>
	<li>P(A <strong>or</strong> B) = P(A) + P(B)         if events A and B are mutually exclusive</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>These axioms are  central to probability. The rest of probability theory can be derived from them.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.2 &nbsp; A few properties of probability</h2>
<p>The following can be proved using only set theory and the three axioms of probability.</p>

<div class="theoremProof">
	<div class="theorem">

<p>Note that the second result applies to events that may <strong>not</strong> be mutually exclusive.</p>

<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">1.3 &nbsp; Conditional probability</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.3.1 &nbsp; Conditional probability</h2>
<p>Sometimes we are interested in situations where we have partial knowledge about the outcome of an experiment. Information from this partial knowledge is expressed via conditional probability.</p>

<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>

<p>If the events \(A\) and \(B\) correspond to categories of two categorical variables and the  probabilities for the possible combinations of the variables' values are laid out in a table (i.e. their <strong>joint</strong> probabilities), the conditional probabilities correspond to scaling rows or columns of the table to sum to one.</p>

<p>The definitions of the conditional probabilities \(P(A \mid B)\)<em> </em>and \(P(B \mid A)\)<em> </em>can be rewritten as </p>

<p>\(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\) are called <strong>marginal</strong> probabilities for <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, whereas \(P(A \textbf { and } B)\) is called their <strong>joint</strong> probability.</p>
<p class="heading">Proportional Venn diagram</p>
<p>The marginal and conditional probabilities can be displayed graphically with a Venn diagram in which one margin is partitioned using the marginal probabilities for \(A\) and the slices are split using the conditional probabilities for \(B\) given \(A\).</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="svgImage" src="../../../en/probCondit/images/s_propnVenn.png" width="324" height="352"></p>

<p>Alternatively, the unit square can be split into horizontal strips using the marginal probabilities for \(B\), then vertically using the conditional probabilities for \(A\) given \(B\). The areas of the resulting rectangles are again equal to

<p>The main branches are usually labelled with their <strong>marginal</strong> probabilities. The branches to the right are labelled with their <strong>conditional</strong> probabilities, conditional on the branches to the left leading to that fork.</p>
<p class="heading">Evaluating joint probabilities</p>
<p>Joint probabilities can  be found by multiplying the probabilities down branches. This corresponds to the general multiplication rule,</p>
\[
P(A \textbf { and } B) \;=\; P(A) \times P(B \mid A)
\]

<p class="heading">Sampling without replacement</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Tree diagrams are more useful for problems in which there is a natural ordering of the two measurements.</p>
</div></div>
<p>An important example of this is when  two or more items are selected from a finite population without replacement  &mdash; in other words, when the same item cannot be selected more than once. The probabilities for the second item chosen depend on which item was chosen first.</p>
<p>The tree diagram below relates to the sex of two students chosen from a class of 2 women and 4 men.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.3.5 &nbsp; More about tree diagrams</h2>
<p>Tree diagrams can be used for <strong>any</strong> situation involving a sequence of events. Each possible sequence of events is represented by a path through the tree diagram. Branches are labelled with the  probability for the branching <strong>conditional on the branches to the left</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if a family want at least two children and no more than four, but will stop when they get a boy, the possible sequences of events are:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="../../../en/probCondit/images/s_tree_girls.png" width="413" height="265"></p>
<p>The joint probability for any sequence of events is again found by multiplying the probabilities on all branches of the tree corresponding to this sequence. If the probability of each child being a boy is \(\frac 1 2\), then the probabilities for the possible sequences of boys and girls are as shown in the diagram.</p>


<h2 class="pageName">1.3.6 &nbsp; Independence</h2>
<p>Two events are called <strong>independent</strong> if knowledge that one event has happened does not provide any information about whether or not the other has also happened. The formal definition is:</p>
<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
	<p>Two events A and B are called <strong>independent</strong> if</p>
\[
P(A \textbf{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
\]

<h1 class="sectionName">1.4 &nbsp; What you need to learn</h1>


<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying  the chapter about probability.</p>
<p class="heading">1.1 Probability</p>
<p>The formal terminology for talking about randomness in page 1.1.2 is important to learn. You should also be able to work out probabilities relating to experiments with equally-likely outcome (page 1.1.4). The rest of this section is background information and will not be examined.</p>
<p class="heading">1.2 Probability calculations</p>
<p>This short chapter is important. You should know the three main axioms of probability (1.2.1), be able to use these axioms, along with set theory, to prove other results about probability (1.2.2) and apply the axioms to real-life examples (1.2.3).</p>
<p class="heading">1.3 Conditional probability</p>
<p>The concept and definition of conditional probability (1.3.1) and independence (1.3.6) are important. However you will not need to use Proportional Venn diagrams — they help to explain some results in this section but will not be examined. You should also understand the idea of partitions of the sample space (1.3.3).</p>
<p>When the randomness of a situation is described with conditional probabilities, you should be able to graph these in a tree diagram and use the tree diagram to work out other probabilities (1.3.4-5).</p>
<p>You should be able to apply the law of total probability (1.3.6) and Bayes theorem (1.3.7) to work out probabilities, but will not be asked to prove these two theorems. You may find it easier to answer questions involving these theorems from first principles rather than the theorems' formulae.</p>
