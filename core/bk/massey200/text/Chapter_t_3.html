<h1>Chapter 3 &nbsp; Successes and Failures</h1>
<h2>3.1 &nbsp; Bernoulli distribution</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 &nbsp; Bernoulli trials</h3>
<p>A Bernoulli random variable arises from a simple random experiment with two possible outcomes that are generically called success and failure. It has value 1 for a success and 0 for a failure.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>Formulae for the Bernoulli distribution's mean and variance are derived.</p>
<h2>3.2 &nbsp; Binomial distribution</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 &nbsp; Binomial random variable</h3>
<p>In a sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials that all have the same probability of success, the number of successes has a binomial distribution.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 &nbsp; Binomial probability function</h3>
<p>The probability function for the binomial distribution is derived.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>Formulae for the mean and variance of the binomial distribution are derived. The mean and variance of the proportion of successes can be found from them.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 &nbsp; Shape of the binomial distribution</h3>
<p>Bar charts show the shape of the binomial distribution for different values of n and π. The distribution's shape approaches a normal distribution when n increases.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 &nbsp; Binomial examples</h3>
<p>This page explains how to evaluate probabilities for binomial random variables and gives some practical examples.</p>
<h3>3.2.6 &nbsp; Cumulative probabilities</h3>
<p>The cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution is graphed for different values of n and π.</p>
<h2>3.3 &nbsp; Geometric distribution</h2>
<h3>3.3.1 &nbsp; Geometric random variable</h3>
<p>The number of Bernoulli trials until the first success has a geometric distribution. Its probabilitiy function is found.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 &nbsp; Cumulative distribution function</h3>
<p>The probability of a value less than or equal to x has a particularly simple formula.</p>
<h3>3.3.3 &nbsp; Examples</h3>
<p>An example is described that relates to the number of times a six-sided die must be rolled until the first six is observed.</p>
<h3>3.3.4 &nbsp; Mean and variance (Proofs not examined)</h3>
<p>Formulae for the mean and variance of the geometric distribution are derived.</p>
<h2>3.4 &nbsp; Negative binomial distribution</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 &nbsp; Probability function</h3>
<p>The number of independent success/failure trials until the k'th success has a negative binomial distribution. This is a generalisation of the geometric distribution.</p>
<h3>3.4.2 &nbsp; Alternative form</h3>
<p>The number of failures until the k'th success equals the number of trials, minus k. It is also sometimes said to have a negative binomial distribution.</p>
<h3>3.4.3 &nbsp; Finding negative binomial probabilities</h3>
<p>An example is given to show how negative binomial probabilities can be calculated.</p>
<h3>3.4.4 &nbsp; Cumulative distribution function</h3>
<p>Cumulative probabilities can either be evaluated by summing probabilities from this distribution, or by summing binomial probabilities, which is usually a simpler calculation.</p>
<h3>3.4.5 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>The mean and variance of the negative binomial distribution are derived.</p>
