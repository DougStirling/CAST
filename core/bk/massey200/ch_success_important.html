<p class="heading">What you need to know in this chapter</p>
<p>You should concentrate on the following material when studying the chapter about distributions based on successes and failures.</p>
<p class="heading">3.1 Bernoulli distribution</p>
<p>You should understand how random variables with Bernoulli distributions are related to successes and failures and be able to derive the mean and variance of the distribution.</p>
<p class="heading">3.2-4 Binomial, Geometric and Negative binomial distributions</p>
<p>You must be able to identify which (if any) of these distributions is appropriate for any context that is described in words. The assumptions underlying the distributions should also be known and you should be able to derive their probability functions (pages 3.2.1-2, 3.3.1 and 3.4.1-2). Be careful to distinguish between the two types of negative binomial distribution (3.4.2).</p>
<p>You should be able to evaluate probabilities (including cumulative ones) relating to specific distributions of these types, both using Excel and by hand with a calculator (pages 3.2.5-6, 3.3.3-4 and 3.4.3-4).</p>
<p>You will not be expected to derive the mean and variance of the geometric distribution, but should be able to find the formulae for those of the binomial and negative binomial distributions (pages 3.2.3 and 3.4.5).</p>
