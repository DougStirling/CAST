<p>This chapter contains a single section that presents the mean and median of a numerical data set as  'typical' values. It also explains the importance of the variability of the values and describes simple measures of spread.</p>
<p>This material is mostly  taught <strong>before</strong> Year 11 in New Zealand high schools so it should be <strong>mainly revision</strong> in Year 11. However  some pages may  provide <strong>extra information</strong> about specific methods since there is some variability in the coverage of topics in Years 9 and 10 between schools.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>The material in this chapter can be used to support the teaching of statistical methods up to Year 10.</p>
	<p>It can also be used for revision within an NCEA Level 1 programme.</p>
	</div>
<p>The chapter  is intended for self-study by students.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>The material <strong>does not cover the complete curriculum</strong>. It has been provided as support material for <strong>parts</strong> of the curriculum.</p>
