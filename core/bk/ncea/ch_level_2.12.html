<p>This chapter explains some statistical concepts related to the NCEA level 2 standard <em><strong>&quot;2.12: Apply probability methods in solving problems&quot;</strong></em>. It is usually taught in Year 12 in New Zealand high schools and is assessed at NCEA Level 2.</p>
<p>The chapter starts with an examination of proportions in contingency tables then extends these concepts with probabilities to describe the relationship between two categorical variables. Tree diagrams can also be used to describe probability models.</p>
<p>The idea of histograms for data sets can be extended to probability density functions to describe populations of continuous numerical values. Normal distributions are the most commonly used distributions of this form.</p>
