<p class="heading">Tree diagrams for other random situations</p>

<p>We introduced tree diagrams on the previous page for two  categorical measurements that we considered to be measured in sequence.</p>
<p>Tree diagrams can be used for any situation involving a sequence of events. Each possible sequence of events is represented by a path through the tree diagram. Branches are labeled with the  probability for the branching <strong>conditional on the branches to the left</strong>.</p>
<p>The joint probability for any sequence of events is again found by multiplying the probabilities on all branches of the tree corresponding to this sequence.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The ideas are more clearly explained in an example.</p>

	<p class="heading">Boys and girls in a family</p>
	<p>A couple plan their family as follows. They want at least two children and no more than four. However, subject to this constraint on their total number of children, they will stop when they get a boy.</p>
	<p>Assuming that  there are no multiple births and the probability of any child being male is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, independent of the genders of previous children, we can construct a tree diagram representing the possible sequences of births.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tree_girls.gif" width="600" height="245"></p>
<p>In this tree diagram, all branches have conditional probability <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> so they are not displayed. The joint probabilities at the end of the branches are found by multiplying these <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>'s together. From it, we can find various probabilities.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Family size</dt>
	<dd>The possible family sizes are 2, 3 or 4 and their probabilities are obtained by adding the joint probabilities for all branches of these lengths. For example,</dd>
	</dl>
<p class="eqn">P(family size = 2) &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0.75</p>
<dl>
	<dd>These probabilities are shown in the following table.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<th align="left">Family size, x</th>
		<td width="40" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">2</td>
		<td width="40" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">3</td>

		<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">0.125</td>
	</tr>
</table></div>
<dl>
	<dt>Number of girls</dt>
	<dd>Another discrete random variable of interest is the number of girls in the family. This is again obtained by adding  joint probabilities from the tree diagram. Check the probabilities in the table below.</dd>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
