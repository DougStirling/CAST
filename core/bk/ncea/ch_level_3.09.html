<p>This chapter explains some statistical concepts related to the NCEA level 3 standard <em><strong>&quot;3.9: Investigate bivariate measurement data&quot;</strong></em>. It is usually taught at Year 13 in New Zealand high schools and is assessed at NCEA Level 3.</p>
<p>Earlier chapters of this e-book explained how to use and interpret scatterplots for bivariate data. This chapter extends this with a summary of the strength of the relationship between the variables and a method to predict the value of one variable from the other.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>The chapter  is intended for self-study by students.</p>

<p class="heading">Assumed background</p>
<p>This chapter assumes an understanding of bivariate data, scatterplots and relationships between variables. Two  sections from  earlier  in this e-book can be used for revision of some of these ideas:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_scatterplot')">Scatterplots</a></li>
	<li><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_relationship')">Understanding relationships</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that you fully understand these sections before starting this chapter.</p>
