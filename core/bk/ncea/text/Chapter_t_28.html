<h1>Chapter 28 &nbsp; More Estimation</h1>
<h2>28.1 &nbsp; Estimating proportions</h2>
<h3>28.1.1 &nbsp; General framework for estimation</h3>
<p>The methodology for describing the accuracy of a sample mean using standard errors and confidence intervals can also be used for other parameter estimates.</p>
<h3>28.1.2 &nbsp; Estimating a proportion</h3>
<p>A sample proportion estimates the corresponding population proportion, π. There is likely to be an error in this estimate and these errors have a distribution.</p>
<h3>28.1.3 &nbsp; Error distribution</h3>
<p>The estimation errors have a type of binomial distribution that is scaled to have mean zero. Its standard deviation is the standard error of the proportion.</p>
<h3>28.1.4 &nbsp; Normal approximation to error distribution</h3>
<p>If the sample size is high enough, the error distribution is approximately normal. This page gives a few examples for which the error distribution is found.</p>
<h3>28.1.5 &nbsp; Confidence interval for proportion</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence interval for a population proportion is the sample proportion ± 1.96 times its standard deviation. Its confidence level is only approximately 95% and guidelines are given for the minimum sample size.</p>
<h3>28.1.6 &nbsp; Properties of 95% CI for proportion</h3>
<p>If samples are repeatedly taken, about 95% of them result in 95% confidence intervals that include the population proportion. Guidelines are given for the minimum sample size to make the confidence level close to 95%.</p>
<h3>28.1.7 &nbsp; Confidence interval examples</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence intervals for a proportion are found and interpreted for several data sets.</p>
<h3>28.1.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Find standard error of proportion</h3>
<p>A template is provided in this exercise to help evaluate the standard error of a sample proportion.</p>
<h3>28.1.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Find 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice at evaluating an approximate 95% confidence interval for a probability.</p>
<h3>28.1.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise presents 3 different statements about a 95% confidence interval and asks which is correct.</p>
<h2>28.2 &nbsp; More about estimation</h2>
<h3>28.2.1 &nbsp; Margin of error</h3>
<p>The margin of error for a survey is related to a confidence interval. It is close to a 95% CI when p is 0.5, but underestimates the accuracy of small or large sample proportions.</p>
<h3>28.2.2 &nbsp; Sample size for estimating mean</h3>
<p>Given a target width for a 95% confidence interval, it is possible to determine the necessary sample size to achieve this accuracy.</p>
<h3>28.2.3 &nbsp; Sample size for estimating proportion</h3>
<p>In a similar way, given a target width for a 95% confidence interval for a proportion, it is possible to determine the necessary sample size.</p>
<h3>28.2.4 &nbsp; Other confidence levels</h3>
<p>All earlier confidence intervals had 95% confidence level. Replacing 1.96 (or 2) with other values gives interval estimates with different confidence levels.</p>
<h3>28.2.5 &nbsp; Exercise: CIs for &micro; with other confidence levels</h3>
<p>In this exercise, confidence intervals for a mean are requested with a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels.</p>
<h3>28.2.6 &nbsp; Exercise: CIs for &pi; with other confidence levels</h3>
<p>This exercise requests a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence intervals for a probability. A normal density can be used to find the relevant z-score and a template helps evaluate the 'plus-minus' value.</p>
<h3>28.2.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Factors affecting CI width of CI for &micro;</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, sample standard deviation and confidence level affect the width of a CI for the mean.</p>
<h3>28.2.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Factors affecting width of CI for &pi;</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, confidence level and population probability affect the width of a CI for the probability.</p>
<h2>28.3 &nbsp; Comparing means in two groups</h2>
<h3>28.3.1 &nbsp; Distn of difference between means</h3>
<p>The difference between the means of two samples from normal populations has a normal distribution whose mean and s.d. can be found from the population means and s.d.s. This is the approximate distribution even when the populations are non-normal.</p>
<h3>28.3.2 &nbsp; SE of difference between means</h3>
<p>When the difference between the sample means is used to estimate the difference between the underlying population means, there is likely to be an error. The error distribution is approximately normal with mean 0. A formula for its standard deviation is given.</p>
