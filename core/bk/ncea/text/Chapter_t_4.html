<h1>Chapter 4 &nbsp; Explore Data (1.10)</h1>
<h2>4.1 &nbsp; Variables and individuals</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 &nbsp; Variables and individuals</h3>
<p>Most data sets contain one or more measurements from each of a collection of 'individuals' (also called 'cases' or 'units').</p>
<h3>4.1.2 &nbsp; Types of variable</h3>
<p>Variables are classified into numerical and categorical variables. A finer classification is also sketched.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 &nbsp; Exercise: Types of variables</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will classify various measurements as numerical (continuous or discrete) or categorical (ordinal or nominal).</p>
<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Understanding distributions</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>Does the data contain any outliers -- values that are atypically large or small? The extreme values in a skew distribution are often mistaken for outliers.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>Does the data split into separate clusters -- ranges of values with high density separated by ranges with low density? Clusters may correspond to different groups of individuals.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h3>
<p>The distribution gives information about a typical value round which the data are spread (the distribution's location or centre) and the variability of the values (the spread of the distribution).</p>
<h3>4.2.4 &nbsp; Names of individuals</h3>
<p>Additional information about the items from which measurements have been made can help us understand the distribution of values in the data.</p>
<h3>4.2.5 &nbsp; Distinguishing known groups</h3>
<p>If we know that the values come from 2 or more groups of individuals, dot plots can be modified to show this extra information.</p>
<h3>4.2.6 &nbsp; Dangers of overinterpretation</h3>
<p>There is a risk of over-interpreting patterns in small data sets.</p>
<h3>4.2.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Information from distributions</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will interpret what distributions with symmetry, skewness, clusters or outliers tell you about the data.</p>
<h2>4.3 &nbsp; More about box plots</h2>
<h3>4.3.1 &nbsp; Displaying outliers</h3>
<p>The basic box plot is often modified to display outliers as separate crosses.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>Box plots cannot show clusters, so must never be used for data with clusters.</p>
<h3>4.3.3 &nbsp; Comparison of groups</h3>
<p>Box plots are particularly effective for displaying differences between several groups of values.</p>
<h3>4.3.4 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h3>
<p>Box plots are relatively stable, and contain less 'noise' than other displays. They can concisely describe differences between even small groups.</p>
<h3>4.3.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a box plot</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page involves drawing a box plots from a sorted lists of values; 'outliers' must be separately identified.</p>
<h2>4.4 &nbsp; Finite populations</h2>
<h3>4.4.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h3>
<p>A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</p>
<h3>4.4.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h3>
<p>A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</p>
<h3>4.4.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h3>
<p>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population. As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </p>
<h3>4.4.4 &nbsp; Sampling error and sample size</h3>
<p>As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </p>
<h3>4.4.5 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations</h3>
<p>Sampling with replacement from a finite population permits the same value to be selected two or more times. Sampling without replacement ensures that there are no such duplicates.</p>
<h3>4.4.6 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h3>
<p>Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</p>
<h3>4.4.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Distinguish between populations and samples</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks whether three statements describe populations or samples.</p>
