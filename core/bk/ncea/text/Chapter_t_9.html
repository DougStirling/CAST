<h1>Chapter 9 &nbsp; Make an Inference (2.9)</h1>
<h2>9.1 &nbsp; Variation</h2>
<h3>9.1.1 &nbsp; Signal and noise</h3>
<p>In many situations, information (signal) can be obscured by random variation (noise).</p>
<h3>9.1.2 &nbsp; Natural variability</h3>
<p>When data are collected from 'individuals', they often vary considerably.</p>
<h3>9.1.3 &nbsp; Variability caused by experiments</h3>
<p>Intentional differences to experimental conditions may also cause systematic differences in variables. Natural variability makes it harder to interpret experimental results.</p>
<h3>9.1.4 &nbsp; Variability in survey data</h3>
<p>The natural variability of individuals also makes it harder to interpret information from surveys.</p>
<h2>9.2 &nbsp; Sampling from a distribution</h2>
<h3>9.2.1 &nbsp; Data as representatives</h3>
<p>We often have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data are collected. The data are representative of some wider situation and we want to generalise from the data to describe features of this more general situation.</p>
<h3>9.2.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h3>
<p>If data collection was repeated, perhaps from different individuals, the values would be different. All such data sets should give similar but not identical information. Interpretation of a data set should take into account this randomness.</p>
<h3>9.2.3 &nbsp; Model to explain randomness</h3>
<p>Many data sets are not generated as random samples from real finite populations. However it is often useful to treat the data as a random sample from some abstract population containing the measurements that might have been recorded.</p>
<h3>9.2.4 &nbsp; Information from a sample</h3>
<p>The mechanism of sampling from a population explains randomness. Although the population is unknown and we only have a single sample, the sample provides information about the population.</p>
<h2>9.3 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h2>
<h3>9.3.1 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h3>
<p>The standard deviation is the most commonly used numerical summary of the spread of values in a data set.</p>
<h3>9.3.2 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb is useful for understanding the numerical value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>9.3.3 &nbsp; Understanding means and st devns</h3>
<p>It is possible to roughly guess the mean and standard deviation from a histogram and roughly sketch a symmetric histogram matching any given mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>9.3.4 &nbsp; Warnings about mean and standard devn</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation cannot give any indication of the existance of outliers, skewness or clusters. A stem and leaf plot or histogram should be examined before reporting these numerical summaries.</p>
<h3>9.3.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Standard deviation from graph</h3>
<p>The first exercise asks for a rough 'guess' at the standard deviation of data sets from a stacked dot plot. The second exercise is similar but displays the data as a histogram or box plot.</p>
<h3>9.3.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Standard deviation from general knowledge</h3>
<p>In this exercise, general knowledge about the type of measurement is enough to roughly guess the value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>9.3.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Rough graph from mean and st devn</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation of a data set should give you a good idea of the likely distribution of values. The first exercise in this page asks you to sketch a stacked dot plot to match a given mean and standard deviation. In the second, a histogram should be drawn.</p>
<h2>9.4 &nbsp; Introduction to estimation</h2>
<h3>9.4.1 &nbsp; Interest in populations</h3>
<p>When data are collected, we are usually more interested in the unknown population distribution from which we assume that the data were generated.</p>
<h3>9.4.2 &nbsp; Interest in parameters</h3>
<p>A few numerical summaries of a population distribution (parameters) often capture its most interesting characteristics. The corresponding sample statistics provide estimates.</p>
<h3>9.4.3 &nbsp; Applications of estimation</h3>
<p>This page gives a few examples where sample statistics are used to estimate important population parameters.</p>
<h3>9.4.4 &nbsp; Estimation error</h3>
<p>The difference between the population parameter and a sample estimate is called the error in the estimate.</p>
<h3>9.4.5 &nbsp; Distribution of errors</h3>
<p>Estimation errors vary from sample to sample and have distributions.</p>
<h3>9.4.6 &nbsp; Standard error and bias</h3>
<p>A good estimator has errors that are close to zero. The error distribution should ideally be centred on zero (unbiased) and have low standard deviation (standard error). The standard error is the standard deviation of both the estimator and the estimation error.</p>
<h3>9.4.7 &nbsp; Interval estimates</h3>
<p>An interval estimate is a range of values within which we are 'confident' that the unknown population parameter lies.</p>
<h3>9.4.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Distinguish between parameters and estimates</h3>
<p>This exercise asks whether three statements describe parameters or estimates.</p>
