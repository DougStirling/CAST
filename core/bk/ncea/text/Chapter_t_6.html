<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Chance and Data (1.12)</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Probability</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h3>
<p>When randomly selecting one value from a population of N different values, the probability of getting any individual value is 1/N. More generally, the probability of sampling a value in any range is the proportion of population values in the range.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Probabilities with infinite populations</h3>
<p>The probability of any type of value is again the proportion of such values in the population. It can also be interpreted as the limiting proportion from a sample of values if the sample size is increased indefinitely.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; Bar charts of discrete probabilities</h3>
<p>Infinite categorical or discrete populations can be described by bar charts of the probabilities.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h3>
<p>In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities and finite populations</h3>
<p>A finite categorical population is shown as a bar chart and the probability of a randomly sampled value being in a range of categories must be found.</p>
<h3>6.1.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities and numerical population</h3>
<p>This exercise is simlar to the one on the previous page but relates to a numerical population that is summarised by a histogram. The probability must be estimated roughly 'by eye' from the area under the histogram.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Contingency tables</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Contingency tables</h3>
<p>Categorical data collected from different groups can be shown in a contingency table. It contains a simple frequency table for each group.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Contingency table examples</h3>
<p>Contingency tables sometimes arise from experiments. Data collected from surveys are often presented in contingency tables.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Proportions within groups</h3>
<p>It is easier to compare groups if bar charts are drawn from the proportions within each group rather than the frequencies.</p>
<h3>6.2.4 &nbsp; Categorical variables and groups</h3>
<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the 'individuals' into groups. Equivalently, grouped data can be represented in a data matrix with a categorical variable.</p>
<h3>6.2.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Create a contingency table</h3>
<p>This exercise presents a list of values of two categorical variables; you must generate a contingency table summarising the data.</p>
<h2>6.3 &nbsp; Time series plots</h2>
<h3>6.3.1 &nbsp; Time series plots</h3>
<p>A time series plot is similar to a scatterplot with 'time' as the variable on the horizontal axis. Successive values are usually joined by lines to emphasise systematic movements in the series.</p>
<h3>6.3.2 &nbsp; Patterns in time series</h3>
<p>A few examples show time series with trend, seasonal pattern and other oscillations.</p>
<h3>6.3.3 &nbsp; Multiple time series</h3>
<p>An example shows four different time series on the same graph.</p>
