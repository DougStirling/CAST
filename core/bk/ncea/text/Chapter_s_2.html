<h2 class="pageName">2.1.2 &nbsp; Basic dot plot</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_dotPlot.gif" width="72" height="324" align="right">
<p class="heading notPrinted">Dot plots</p>
<p>Some ranges of values 
		are more common than others &mdash; they have higher <strong>density</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest graphical display of data that shows where there is high and low density is a <strong>dot
		plot</strong>. This shows each value as a cross (or dot) against a
		numerical axis.</p>
	<p>The gap between 3.4 and 4.9 is more obvious on the right than in a textual
list of values, whether ordered or not.</p>
	<br clear="all">





<h2 class="pageName">2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Jittering the crosses</p>
	<p>In all but the smallest data sets, the crosses on a basic dot plot overlap, making it difficult to identify regions of high density.</p>
	<p>Randomly moving crosses away from the axis reduces this problem by separating the crosses:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_jitteredDotPlot.gif" width="398" height="72"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Note that the vertical jittering is random and therefore tells you nothing about the data.</p>
	




<h2 class="pageName">2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Stacked dot plots</p>
	<p><strong>Stacking</strong> the crosses into columns is usually better than
jittering them.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stackedDotPlot.gif" alt="" width="400" height="150"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Stacking highlights regions of high density well (tall stacks).</p>
	


<h2 class="pageName">2.1.5 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Digits instead of crosses</p>
	<p>Stem and leaf plots are closely related to stacked dot plots. The crosses are replaced by digits that provide a little more detail about the values that they represent.</p>
	<p class=heading>Stems and leaves</p>
	<p>In a stem and leaf plot, the axis is  replaced by a column of 'stems' &mdash; the most significant digits of the values in the data. The digits that replace the crosses are called 'leaves' and give a further significant digit of each value on a stem.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stemLeaf.gif" alt="" width="141" height="165"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>A final refinement is to sort the leaves into increasing order on each stem.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.1.6 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Smoothness</p>
	<p>When drawing a stem and leaf plot, the aim is for a smooth shape to the stem
and leaf plot, and this is usually achieved by between 10 and 20 rows of leaves.</p>
	<p class=heading>Drawing by hand</p>
	<p>When data are analysed on a computer, a stacked dot plot usually describes a distribution of values more clearly than a stem and leaf plot.</p>
	<p>However stem and leaf plots are easy to draw by hand:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Decide on the stems to use &mdash; usually between 10 and 20 of them.</li>
		<li>Scan down the values identifying the leaf digits and writing them against the value's stem.</li>
		<li>Finally, sort the leaves on each stem into order.<br clear="all">
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>To simplify drawing, values are truncated to give their stems and leaf digits,
not rounded. For example, 7.98 and 7.90 would both be displayed as leaf '9' on
the stem '7'.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.2.1 &nbsp; Density of values</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Density</p>
	<p>In a stacked dot plot (or stem and leaf plot), the highest stacks contain the most values. These stacks have the highest <strong>density</strong> of values.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_dotPlotCanopy.gif" name="dataImage" width="445" height="220"></p>
<p>Histograms more directly show how density varies along the axis.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.2 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Histograms</p>
<p>In a simple histogram, the axis is split into sub-intervals of equal width called <strong>classes</strong>. A rectangle is drawn above each class with height equal to the number of values  in the class &mdash; the <strong>frequency</strong> of the class.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_histo.gif" width="502" height="349"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.3 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Aim of a 'smooth' histogram</p>
	<p>There is considerable freedom in the choice of histogram classes. The exact
shape depends on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Class width</li>
		<li>Start value for first class</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We usually choose classes with the aim of <strong>smoothness</strong> in the outline 
		of the histogram rectangles.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_classWidths.gif" width="368" height="360"></p>
	<p>The choice of 'best' classes is subjective, but...</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If your conclusions about what a histogram tells you about the data  depend on the choice of histogram classes, you are over-interpreting its shape.</p>
	</div></div>

	


<h2 class="pageName">2.2.4 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Warning for small data sets</p>
	<p>For small data sets, changing the class width and the starting position for
the first class can give a <strong>surprising amount of variability in histogram
shape</strong>, so be extremely wary of over-interpreting features  such as
clusters or skewness.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is probably better to avoid using histograms unless there is a reasonable number of values &mdash; stacked dot plots are far less likely to mislead you over minor features.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.5 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Relative frequencies to compare two groups</p>
	<p>Histograms may be superimposed to compare two groups. However if the groups
differ in size,  it is usually more meaningful to compare relative frequencies
(proportions) than the counts in the classes.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Use <strong>relative frequency</strong> histograms to compare groups.</p>
</div></div>
	<p>For example,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_histoGroups.gif" width="456" height="461" class="summaryPict"></p>
	<p class=heading>Population pyramids</p>
	<p>Relative frequency histograms are also used to describe the distribution of ages in populations. Males and females are separately displayed to the left and right of a central axis, and different sub-populations may be shown in separate 'pyramids'.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/popnPyramids.gif" id="gif_image_2_5_1" width="550" height="270"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/density/images/popnPyramids.svg" id="svg_image_2_5_1" width="550" height="270" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_5_1");</script></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.6 &nbsp; Frequency polygons</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Frequency polygons</p>
<p>A <strong>frequency polygon</strong> is closely related to a histogram with equal class widths. It joins the midpoints of the tops of the class rectangles and tends to give a smoother outline than the corresponding histogram.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_freqPoly.gif" width="448" height="237"></p>
<p>It is easier to distinguish and compare superimposed frequency polygons for two groups than the corresponding histograms.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_freqPoly2.gif" width="449" height="206"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.2.7 &nbsp; Drawing histograms by hand</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Frequency table</p>
<p>A computer is normally used to draw histograms. Hand-drawn histograms are
based on a <strong>frequency table</strong> that lists the histogram classes
and their frequencies.</p>
<p>To avoid ambiguity in the histogram, the class boundaries should be chosen to ensure that no data values are on boundaries. For example,</p>
<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/freqTable2.gif" id="gif_image_2_7_1" width="280" height="150"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/density/images/freqTable2.svg" id="svg_image_2_7_1" width="280" height="150" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_7_1");</script></div>
<p class=heading>Height of a histogram rectangle</p>
<p>To draw a histogram by hand with equal class widths, each class rectangle
can be drawn with height equal to its class frequency. If class widths vary,
we need to calculate the <strong>density</strong> for each class with the formula:</p>
<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/densityDefn.gif" id="gif_image_2_7_2" width="284" height="39"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/density/images/densityDefn.svg" id="svg_image_2_7_2" width="284" height="39" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_7_2");</script> </p>
<p>and use this for the rectangle heights.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.1 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Unhelpful detail when comparing groups</p>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain a lot of detail about
the distribution of values in a data set. This level of detail is useful when
examining a single data set, but when several groups of values are being compared,
the detail distracts from the main differences between the groups.</p>
<p>For example, the jittered dot plots below do not concisely summarise the differences
between the five groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_jitteredGroups.gif" width="413" height="224"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Five-number summary</p>
<p>Five values are enough to capture a lot of information about the distribution of values in a data set.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The two <strong>extremes</strong>  (i.e. the minimum and maximum values).</li>
	<li>The <strong>lower quartile</strong>, <strong>median</strong> and <strong>upper quartile</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These values split the data set into four groups with approximately equal numbers of values.</p>
<p class="heading">Box plot</p>
<p>A box plot displays the five-number summary graphically.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_boxPlotDefn.gif" width="445" height="225"></p>
<p class="heading">Details</p>
<p>The median, <em>m</em>, is the middle value if there is an odd number of values in the data set. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two.</p>
<p>Different authors give slightly different definitions for the upper and lower
quartiles. One definition of the lower quartile is the median of the lowest half
of the data &mdash; i.e. of the values lower than <em>m</em>. (The upper quartile
would then be defined as the median of the top half of the values.)</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Provided you are consistent, different definitions of the quartiles  should lead you to the same conclusions.</p>
