<h2 class="pageName">17.1.1 &nbsp; Experiments and treatments</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
	<p>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
	one or more explanatory variables.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
	<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
		Depending on the type of experiment, these units could be people, animals, trees, areas in a field, shops in a retail chain, ...</p>
	<p>In the experiments that we will examine here, a single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.</p>
	<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
	<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit. These controlled characteristics are  explanatory variables and are called <strong>factors</strong> in the context of an experiment. The different values 
		of the controlled characteristics are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>
	<p>The decision about which  treatment is applied to 
				each experimental unit is called the <strong>experimental 
	design</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="pageName">17.1.2 &nbsp; Variable experimental units</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Differences between experimental units</p>
	<p>In practice, it is usually impossible to conduct experiments with experimental units that are identical. The experimental units usually  have 
  characteristics that vary from unit to unit.</p>
	<p>These differences between the experimental units result in variability in the response measurements that are made from them, even if all receive the same treatment.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">17.1.3 &nbsp; A badly designed experiment</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Bad experimental design</p>
	<p>If the treatments are allocated to experimental units in a way that is associated with their naturally varying characteristics, the apparent relationship between the treatments and the response can be distorted.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/designIntro/images/lurking2.gif" id="gif_image_1_3_1" width="297" height="120"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/designIntro/images/lurking2.svg" id="svg_image_1_3_1" width="297" height="120" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_1_3_1");</script></p>
	<p>This is similar to the effect of  lurking variables in observational studies.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_varyingUnits.gif" width="371" height="334"></p>
	<p class="heading">Good experimental design</p>
	<p>Since variability in the experimental units is usually unavoidable, we cannot 
		prevent their effect on the response. However  it is possible 
		to allocate treatments to the  units in a way that either eliminates, 
		or at least reduces, the relationship between the treatment, <em>X</em>, and 
		characteristics of the experimental units. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/designIntro/images/lurking3.gif" id="gif_image_1_3_2" width="297" height="120"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/designIntro/images/lurking3.svg" id="svg_image_1_3_2" width="297" height="120" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_1_3_2");</script></p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Good experimental design can avoid the potential effect of lurking 
			variables.</p>
	</div></div>
	



<h2 class="pageName">17.1.4 &nbsp; Confounding</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Confounding</p>
	<p>The design of an experiment may make it <strong>impossible</strong> to 
		disentangle the effects of the treatment and other characteristics of the experimental uits. If the treatment is perfectly correlated with another 
		variable, the effects of the two variables <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished. 
	The treatment and variable are then said to be <strong>confounded</strong>.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>It is particularly important to avoid confounding in an experiment.</p></div></div>
	<p>In an experiment, <em>treatment A</em> was applied to 10 experimental units in 2010 and <em>treatment B</em> was used on 10 similar units in 2011.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_confounded.gif" width="340" height="134"></p>
	<p>It is <strong>impossible</strong> to tell whether the higher mean response for <em>treatment A</em> than <em>treatment B</em> was caused by the different treatments or other differences between the two years.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">17.1.5 &nbsp; Randomisation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Avoiding lurking variables</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>An important goal of experimental design is to minimise association 
	between allocation of the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units.</p></div></div>
	<p>If the varying characteristics of the experimental units are understood and measured before the experiment is conducted, treatments can be allocated to ensure that there is no association. (See the later page about <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('designIntro7')">blocking in experiments</a>.)</p>
	<p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
	<p>When the differing characteristics of the experimental units are unmeasured, 
		 association between them and the treatments can be minimised by randomly 
		allocating treatments to the experimental units. This is called <strong>randomisation</strong> of the treatments and the experimental design is called a <strong>completely randomised 
			design</strong>. </p>
	<p>Randomisation does not <strong>guarantee</strong> that there will be no association 
		between the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units &mdash; by chance, 
		there may be some association. However...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Randomisation means that is unlikely that such lurking 
				variables will affect the conclusions.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Mechanics of randomisation</p>
	<p>The simplest way to randomise allocation of treatments to the experimental units is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Number the available experimental units from 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Find a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Allocate the treatments in order to the unit numbers given by the permutation.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Finding the random permutation is fairly easy in a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write the numbers 1 to <em>n</em> in a spreadsheet column</li>
		<li>Generate random numbers in an adjacent column &mdash; in Excel, type &quot;=RAND()&quot; in each cell.</li>
		<li>Select the two columns and use a menu command to sort the rows into ascending order of the random numbers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This gives a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">17.1.6 &nbsp; Replication</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Causes of variation</p>
	<p>In a completely randomised experiment,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some variation in the response measurements is caused by <strong>differences between the treatments</strong>. The experiment is conducted to discover the effect of the treatments.</li>
		<li><strong>Random variation</strong> is a catch-all that refers to all variation  that cannot 
		be explained in terms of the treatments.</li>
	</ul>
<p class="heading">Distinguishing the treatment effect and random variation</p>
	<p>To find the effect of the treatments on the response, it is essentionl that we can distinguish it from random 
	variation.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>There must be enough data to <strong>estimate random variation</strong> separately from variation caused by the treatments. </p>
	</div></div>
	<p><strong>Replication</strong> involves repeat measurements for each treatment. The variation <strong>within</strong> each treatment is all random variation.</p>
	<p>Understanding the amount of random variation is necessary before you can interpret the effect of the treatments.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_replication.gif" width="550" height="335"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">17.1.7 &nbsp; Blocking</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Known differences between the experimental units</p>
	<p>When nothing is known about the differences between the experimental units 
		before the experiment is conducted, we can do no better than to randomise allocation 
		of treatments to the units.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>This design can be improved when more is known about the differences between the experimental 
				units.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Randomised block designs</p>
	<p>Ideally all experimental units are virtually identical (minimum random variation) but in practice they are often highly variable. A better design groups similar experimental units into <strong>blocks</strong>.</p>
	<p>In a <strong>randomised block design</strong>, a separate experiment is conducted within each block with  treatments  randomly allocated to its experimental units. Although all data are analysed together, the lower random variation <strong>within each block</strong>  means that differences between the treatments can be more accurately estimated.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple block design</p>
	<p>Although it is not essential,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If possible, researchers usually try to define blocks that have the same size and use each treatment the same number of times within each block. </p>
	</div></div>
	<p>With  equal replicates for all treatments in every block, each treatment  mean  uses the same number of values in each block, so comparisons between treatment means are not affected by differences between the blocks.</p>

	<p>In the example above, the experimental units were grouped into blocks of six, with each treatment randomly allocated to three within each block. Even though the response values are much higher in Block 1, this affects both treatment means equally, so the difference between them is unaffected.</p>
	<p class="heading">Comparison of completely randomised and randomised block designs</p>
	<p>Grouping experimental units into blocks of similar units and using a randomised block design gives more accurate estimates of the treatment effects than a completely randomised design that ignores the blocks.</p>
