<h2 class="pageName">13.1.1 &nbsp; Probability models and simulation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>Probability describes situations where a random sample is selected from a population. It  is also used to model a 
	variety of <strong>other</strong> situations involving randomness.</p>
<p class=heading>Tennis match</p>
	<p>A simple model for a tennis match between two players, A and B, assumes that:</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<ul>
			<li>Probability of A winning  serve = π<sub>1</sub></li>
			<li>Probability of B winning  serve = π<sub>2</sub></li>
			<li>The results of successive points are independent</li>
			<li>The standard years of tennis</li>
		</ul>
	</div></div>
	<p>A more complex model might introduce more parameters to relax the assumption of independence.</p>
	<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
	<p>For any values of  π<sub>1</sub> and  π<sub>2</sub>, we could randomly generate the results of successive points until a match was complete.</p>
	<p>This generates an <strong>instance</strong> of the model and is called a <strong>simulation</strong>.</p>
	




<h2 class="pageName">13.1.2 &nbsp; Simulation: Will the best team win?</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Repetitions of  a simulation</p>
	<p>Repeating a simulation and observing the 
		variability in the results can give insight into the randomness of the system's 
		behaviour.</p>
	<p class=heading>Model for sport league</p>
	<p>Consider a sports league of 10 teams in which each team plays each other twice and:</p>
	<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
		<tr>
			<td class="top bottom left">&nbsp;Points from a match =&nbsp;</td>
			<td class="top bottom right">3 if team wins<br>
				1 if team draws<br>
				0 if team loses</td>
		</tr>
	</table></div>
	<p>We will model the league with a simple model for the results of individual matches. In it, team A has over twice the probability of winning than losing, but all other teams are equally matched.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The results of all matches are independent</li>
		<li>P(draw) = 0.2 in all matches</li>
		<li>P(team A wins its matches) = 0.55 and P(A loses) = 0.25</li>
		<li>All other teams are equally matched with P(win) = P(lose) = 0.4.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
	<p>This model can be used to randomly generate the results of all 90 matches in the league.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_league1.gif" width="455" height="360"></p>
	<p>Repeating the simulation 100 times gives the following results:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_league2.gif" width="421" height="312"></p>
	<p>Despite team A being so much better than the other teams, the simulation shows that it has little more than 50% chance of ending the season on top of the league.</p>

	<p class="heading">Evidence of skill? </p>
	<p>A quarter of the matches in 2008/9 were draws, so we will conduct a simulation with a model in which all teams are equally matched and:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>P(draw)  =  0.25</li>
		<li>P(win)  =  P(lose)  =  0.375</li>
	</ul>
	<p>From each simulated league, we will summarise the spread of points at the end of the season using both their range and their standard deviation. After 100 simulated leagues, these measures of spread are shown below.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_leagueSpread.gif" width="476" height="352"></p>
	<p>The actual spread of points in the 2008/9 league was much higher than those that appeared in the simulations with equally matched teams, indicating that there was indeed a difference between the skill levels of the best and worst teams in the league.</p>
	



<h2 class="pageName">13.1.4 &nbsp; Assessing unusual features in data</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Interpreting a graphical summary of a sample</p>
	<p>Simulations can also help us to assess features such as outliers, clusters or skewness in a data set 
		by examining how often they appear in random samples from a population <strong>without</strong> such features.</p>
	<p>In particular, we can examine variability in samples from a normal 
		distribution that closely matches the shape of the data set. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_skewnessSim.gif" width="381" height="305"></p>
	<p>The amount of skewness  in the the actual data (top) is rarely seen in simulated normal samples (such as that shown above). This informally suggests that the the population underlying the data really is skew and not symmetric.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">13.1.5 &nbsp; Random numbers</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Random values</p>
	<p>Simulations are conducted by generating random 
		values from the probability distributions in the model.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A computer program should normally be used to generate 
				random values. The program Excel contains functions that can be used.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>Generating categorical and numerical values 
		is usually based on random values that are equally likely to take any value between 0 and 1. Such a value is said to come from 
		a rectangular (or uniform) distribution between 0 and 1 and has the probability 
		density function shown below.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probSim/images/uniform01.gif" id="gif_image_1_5_1" width="185" height="169"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/probSim/images/uniform01.svg" id="svg_image_1_5_1" width="185" height="169" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_1_5_1");</script></p>
	<p>A value can be generated from a rectangular distribution with the Excel function &quot;=RAND()&quot; or, by hand, by  generating a sequence of
	random digits (e.g. by rolling a 10-sided die).</p>




<h2 class="pageName">13.1.6 &nbsp; Generating categorical values</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Generating a categorical value</p>
	<p>A random category can be generated from a rectangularly distributed random value, <span class="em black">r</span> .</p>
	<p>If P(<em>success</em>)  is denoted by the symbol <span class="black">π</span>, 
		then a <em>success</em> will be generated if <span class="em black">r</span>  is less than <span class="black">π</span>. This can be generalised as illustrated in the diagram below:</p>
