<h1>Chapter 13 &nbsp; Use Simulation (2.13)</h1>
<h2>13.1 &nbsp; Simulation</h2>
<h3>13.1.1 &nbsp; Probability models and simulation</h3>
<p>Probability can be used to model complex situations. A simulation of the model involves using the model's probabilities to generate an instance of the situation. Repeating the simulation can give insight into the behaviour of the system.</p>
<h3>13.1.2 &nbsp; Simulation: Will the best team win?</h3>
<p>A simulation demonstrates that the best team is often not top of a league at the end of the season even if it has a much higher probability of winning individual matches than all other teams.</p>
<h3>13.1.3 &nbsp; Is there evidence of skill in a league?</h3>
<p>A simulation of a soccer league shows that the spread of points at the end of an actual soccer season is not consistent with all teams having equal abilities.</p>
<h3>13.1.4 &nbsp; Assessing unusual features in data</h3>
<p>The variability of displays from 'regular' populations (such as normal distributions) can be used to assess features in a single data set, such as outliers, clusters or skewness.</p>
<h3>13.1.5 &nbsp; Random numbers</h3>
<p>Simulations are based on randomly generated values. These are generally based on random numbers for which any value between 0 and 1 is equally likely.</p>
<h3>13.1.6 &nbsp; Generating categorical values</h3>
<p>A random categorical value can be easily generated from a random number between 0 and 1.</p>
