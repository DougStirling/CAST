<h1>Chapter 14 &nbsp; Time Series (3.8)</h1>
<h2>14.1 &nbsp; Smoothing</h2>
<h3>14.1.1 &nbsp; Moving averages</h3>
<p>Moving averages are a simple way to smooth out irregularities in a time series.</p>
<h3>14.1.2 &nbsp; More about moving averages</h3>
<p>When an even number of values is used for the moving averages, the smoothed values are at times half-way between those of the raw data. The method can be modified to give smoothed values at the times of the original values.</p>
<h2>14.2 &nbsp; Long-term trend</h2>
<h3>14.2.1 &nbsp; Linear trend</h3>
<p>Many time series steadily increase or decrease over time and a linear model may describe the trend. This kind of model can be fitted by least squares.</p>
<h3>14.2.2 &nbsp; Quadratic trend</h3>
<p>If the trend is nonlinear, a quadratic model might describe the trend better and can also be fitted by least squares.</p>
<h3>14.2.3 &nbsp; Forecasting</h3>
<p>Linear and quadratic models can be used to forecast future values.</p>
<h2>14.3 &nbsp; Seasonal data</h2>
<h3>14.3.1 &nbsp; Seasonal patterns</h3>
<p>Seasonal data may show a pattern that repeats at regular intervals.</p>
<h3>14.3.2 &nbsp; Smoothing out seasonal variation</h3>
<p>Moving averages with order equal to the number of seasons can smooth out seasonal variation.</p>
<h3>14.3.3 &nbsp; Estimating the seasonal effect</h3>
<p>The average difference between the data and the corresponding smoothed values in any month is called the seasonal effect for that month.</p>
<h3>14.3.4 &nbsp; Deseasonalised data</h3>
<p>Subtracting the seasonal effect from the raw data is called seasonally adjusting the data and the resulting values are called deseasonalised.</p>
<h3>14.3.5 &nbsp; Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Seasonal data can be split into three components -- seasonal, trend and residual.</p>
<h3>14.3.6 &nbsp; Forecasting with seasonal data</h3>
<p>The seasonal and trend components of a time series can each be forecast into the future. Adding them provides a forecast for future values. </p>
