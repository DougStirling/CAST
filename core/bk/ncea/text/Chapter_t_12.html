<h1>Chapter 12 &nbsp; Use Probability (2.12)</h1>
<h2>12.1 &nbsp; Proportions from tables</h2>
<h3>12.1.1 &nbsp; Relationships between variables</h3>
<p>In some contingency tables, either the rows or columns can be used to split the individuals into groups.</p>
<h3>12.1.2 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>The two marginal distributions are found by adding the joint frequencies (or proportions) across rows or down columns of a contingency table.</p>
<h3>12.1.3 &nbsp; Conditional distributions</h3>
<p>Conditional distributions are obtained by scaling the rows (or columns) of a contingency table to make them all sum to 1.0.</p>
<h3>12.1.4 &nbsp; Conditional vs marginal distns</h3>
<p>Proportional Venn diagrams are a useful way to display joint distributions and to understand the relationships between conditional and marginal distributions.</p>
<h3>12.1.5 &nbsp; Exercise:   Proportions from contingency tables</h3>
<p>In this exercise you are shown contingency tables and asked to find a joint, marginal or conditional proportion.</p>
<h2>12.2 &nbsp; Probabilities from tables</h2>
<h3>12.2.1 &nbsp; Joint probabilities</h3>
<p>Bivariate categorical data are modelled as a sample from a population that consists of pairs of categorical values. The joint probability for any pair of categories is their population proportion.</p>
<h3>12.2.2 &nbsp; Marginal probabilities</h3>
<p>The marginal probabilities for a variable are the population proportions for its possible values. They can be found by summing joint probabilities.</p>
<h3>12.2.3 &nbsp; Conditional probabilities</h3>
<p>Conditional probabilites for a variable are proportions in a sub-population containing a specific value for the other variable. They are found by scaling the joint probabilities in that sub-population.</p>
<h3>12.2.4 &nbsp; Graphical display of probabilities</h3>
<p>Joint, marginal and conditional probabilities can be displayed graphically.</p>
<h3>12.2.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities for cards and dice</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for probabilities about a card drawn at random from a standard pack of playing cards or when two dice are rolled.</p>
<h3>12.2.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Sampling with and without replacement</h3>
<p>This exercise relates to pairs of numbers drawn with or without replacement from a small finite population. The question asks for a probability about either the sum or difference of the two numbers.</p>
<h2>12.3 &nbsp; Tree diagrams</h2>
<h3>12.3.1 &nbsp; Tree diagrams</h3>
<p>A tree diagram is another device useful for displaying and calculating conditional and joint probabilities. A situation summarised in a table of joint probabilities can be represented in tree diagram form, and vice versa.</p>
<h3>12.3.2 &nbsp; More about tree diagrams</h3>
<p>We can use a tree diagram for any situation that involves a sequence of events.</p>
<h2>12.4 &nbsp; More about histograms</h2>
<h3>12.4.1 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h3>
<p>In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</p>
<h3>12.4.2 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h3>
<p>If a histogram has varying class widths, the vertical axis must be 'density'. The histogram shape would be misleading if frequency or relative frequency was used for the vertical axis.</p>
<h3>12.4.3 &nbsp; Understanding histograms</h3>
<p>Whether or not class widths are equal, the proportion of values in any classes always equals the proportion of the total histogram area that is above the classes.</p>
<h3>12.4.4 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw histogram with mixed class widths</h3>
<p>In this page, you will draw histograms of different data sets.</p>
<h3>12.4.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Histogram areas and proportions</h3>
<p>The two exercises in this page ask you to use the shape of a histogram to find the proportion of values in a given range. The first exercise shows the number of values in each class, but the second requires the histogram area to be estimated 'by eye'.</p>
<h2>12.5 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h2>
<h3>12.5.1 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h3>
<p>In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</p>
<h3>12.5.2 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h3>
<p>Infinite continuous numerical populations are described with a type of histogram called a probability density function.</p>
<h3>12.5.3 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters, µ and σ, can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</p>
<h3>12.5.4 &nbsp; Probability and area under the pdf</h3>
<p>When a value is sampled from an infinite continuous population, the probability that it is between a and b equals the area under the p.d.f. between these two values.</p>
<h3>12.5.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Estimate probability from pdf</h3>
<p>In this exercise, probabilities are obtained from the areas under a probability density function.</p>
<h2>12.6 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2>
<h3>12.6.1 &nbsp; Importance of normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are sometimes useful as models for data, but the main reason for their importance is that sample means and many other summary statistics have approximately normal distributions.</p>
<h3>12.6.2 &nbsp; Shape of normal distributions</h3>
<p>All normal distributions look the same on a scale of standard deviations from the mean.</p>
<h3>12.6.3 &nbsp; Sketching a normal distribution</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are centred on their mean and have hardly any area beyond 3σ on each side. A small area (about 5%) is over 2σ away from the mean.</p>
<h3>12.6.4 &nbsp; Some normal probabilities</h3>
<p>The probabilities of being within (σ, 2σ, and 3σ) of the mean are (0.68, 0.95 and 0.997) for all normal distributions. This is a close match to the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb for numerical data sets.</p>
<h3>12.6.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Normal distribution parameters</h3>
<p>One exercise asks you to guess the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Another requests a sketch of a normal distribution given its mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>12.6.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities without calculations</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb gives the approximate probability of a value within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. Te exercise uses this rule of thumb to find some normal probabilities without formal calculations.</p>
<h2>12.7 &nbsp; Normal probabilities</h2>
<h3>12.7.1 &nbsp; Units-free variables (z-scores)</h3>
<p>Standardising a variable gives z-scores that do not depend on the units of the original variable.</p>
<h3>12.7.2 &nbsp; Z-scores</h3>
<p>Any value, x, can be translated into a z-score that gives the number of standard deviations above the mean.</p>
<h3>12.7.3 &nbsp; Finding normal probabilities</h3>
<p>Z-scores have a standard normal distribution (mean 0 and s.d. 1). The probability of a value less than x can be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>12.7.4 &nbsp; Other probabilities</h3>
<p>The probability that X is greater than a specified value or is between two values can also be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>12.7.5 &nbsp; Normal tables</h3>
<p>If a computer is not available, tables of probabilities for the standard normal distribution are used to find normal probabilities.</p>
<h3>12.7.6 &nbsp; Finding normal quantiles</h3>
<p>The inverse problem of finding the x-value corresponding to a given probability is also solved using z-scores. If normal tables are used, they must be looked up differently.</p>
<h3>12.7.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Probability and area under pdf</h3>
<p>Exercise asks for a normal probability by reading an area under a normal histogram (pdf).</p>
<h3>12.7.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities from z-scores</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page is similar to the previous exercise, but the question must be first translated into one involving a z-score. The required probability is read off a standard normal histogram (pdf).</p>
<h3>12.7.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Expected count in sample</h3>
<p>Instead of the probability of getting a value within some range, the questions in this exercise ask for the expected number out of n items. </p>
<h3>12.7.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Find X from probability</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks the inverse problem; given a probability, it ask for the corresponding range of values using a standard normal histogram (pdf). </p>
