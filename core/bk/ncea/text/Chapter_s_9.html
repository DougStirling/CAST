<p class="heading notPrinted">Signal and noise</p>
	<p>Electronics and telecommunications engineers distinguish between the <strong>signal</strong> that is being communicated between two locations and the random <strong>noise</strong> that is added by the communications channel. The noise degrades the signal 
		and, in the worst cases, can make the signal difficult to detect.</p>
	<p>The word &quot;CAST&quot; is hard to read in the following noisy image.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/variation/images/s_noisyText.gif" width="337" height="137"></p>
	<p>Audio equipment often quotes its <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong> as 
		a measure of quality. Noise again deteriorates the signal &mdash; the 'perfect' 
		music that you want to hear. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Signal &nbsp; = &nbsp; information you want<br>

	sets.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">9.1.2 &nbsp; Natural variability</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Reasons for variability</p>
	<p>Most statistical data sets contain measurements 
		 from a collection of 'individuals'. These individuals are not identical
so measurements  made from them also vary from individual to individual.</p>
<p>Even when the 'individuals' are very similar,  recorded measurements from 
them often vary due to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Variability of the environment in which the measurements were made</li>
		<li>Variability in the measurement procedure itself<br>
	</li>
	</ul>




<h2 class="pageName">9.1.3 &nbsp; Variability caused by experiments</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Intentional differences</p>
	<p>In experiments, different 'individuals' are given different <strong>experimental

<p class=heading>Surveys</p>
	<p>Some types of data are obtained from experiments. In experiments, we actively change some characteristics of each individual &mdash; choosing an experimental treatment.</p>
	<p>Other types of data are obtained by selecting a sample of individuals in
some way and simply recording information about them &mdash; a <strong>survey</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading>Summarising data</p>
	<p>Survey data sets are often large and are  summarised by numerical
values called <strong>summary
statistics</strong>.<br>
	</p>
<p>Natural variability between individuals means that summary statistics 
		 must  be considered as random quantities 
	&mdash; similarly collected data would result in different values.</p>

<p>A important role of statistics is to understand and describe the randomness
of such summary statistics.</p>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Generalising from data</p>
	<p>Most data sets do <strong>not</strong> arise from randomly sampling individuals from a finite population. However we are still rarely interested in the specific individuals from whom data 
		were collected.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The recorded data are often 'representative' of something 
					more general.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The main aim  is to <strong>generalise from the data</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">9.2.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Randomness of data</p>
	<p>Not only do we usually have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data were collected, but we must also acknowledge that our data would have been different if, by chance, we had selected different individuals or even made our measurements at a different time.</p>
	<p>We must acknowledge 
		this sample-to-sample variability when interpreting the data. The data are <strong>random</strong>.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>All graphical and numerical summaries would 
					be different if we repeated data collection.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>This randomness in the data must be taken into account when we interpret graphical and numerical summaries. Our conclusions should not be dependent on features  that are specific to our particular data but would (probably) be different if the data were collected again.</p>
	<p>The more data that we collect, the more accurately our  data will reflect population characteristics, but randomness always exists.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">9.2.3 &nbsp; Model to explain randomness</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Data that are <span class="red">not</span> sampled from a finite population</p>
	<p>There is   no real finite population underlying most data sets   from which the values can be treated 
		as being sampled. The randomness in such data must be explained in a different way.</p>
	<p class=heading>Sampling from an abstract  population</p>
	<p>&quot;Random sampling from a population&quot; is  also used to explain variability even when there is no <strong>real</strong> finite population from which the data were sampled.</p>
	<p>We imagine an <strong>abstract</strong> population of <strong>all values that might have been obtained</strong> if the data collection had been repeated. We can then treat the observed data as a random sample from this abstract population.</p>
	<p>Defining such an underlying population therefore not only explains sample-to-sample variability but also gives us a focus for generalising from  our specific data.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">9.2.4 &nbsp; Information from a sample</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling from a population</p>
	<p>Sampling from an underlying population (whether finite or infinite) gives us a mechanism to explain the randomness of data. The underlying population also gives us a <strong>focus</strong> for generalising from our sample data &mdash; the distribution of values in the population is fixed and does not depend on the specific sample data.</p>
	<p class="heading">Unknown population</p>
	<p>Unfortunately the population underlying most data sets is unknown and, in practice, we only have a <strong>single sample</strong>. However this single sample does throw light on the population distribution.</p>
	<p>The diagram below describes a sample from a categorical distribution. Although the underlying population is unknown, the sample proportion of successes, <em>p</em>, is an <strong>estimate</strong> of the unknown proportions of successes in the population (denoted by π).</p>

	<p class="heading">Variance</p>
	<p>The square of the standard deviation, <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, is called the
sample <strong>variance</strong>. Variances are sometimes reported and used but
standard deviations are easier to interpret since they have  the same units as
the original data (e.g. kilograms or dollars).</p>

 


<h2 class="pageName">9.3.2 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">'Quarter-range' rule of thumb</p>
	<p>For many data sets, the standard deviation is just under 
		a quarter of the range.</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations2.gif" id="gif_image_3_2_1" width="454" height="158"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations2.svg" id="svg_image_3_2_1" width="454" height="158" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_3_2_1");</script></td>
	</tr>
</table></div>

	<p>This is a simple rule, but is only very approximate. The standard deviation 
		can be more than a quarter the range in distributions with short tails or 
		much less if there are long tails or outliers.</p>
	<p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb</p>
	<p>The <strong>70-95-100 rule</strong> is more accurate. In many distributions, </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Approximately 70% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
		<li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
		<li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule holds approximately for most reasonably symmetric data 
		sets, but for skew data or distributions with long tails, outliers or clusters, it is often less accurate.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">9.3.3 &nbsp; Understanding means and st devns</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>Understanding the
		definition of the standard deviation is much less important than knowing
its properties and having a feel for what its numerical value tells you about
the data. </p>
	<p class="heading">Guessing <em>s</em> from histogram</p>
<p>About 95% of the values should 
		be within 2<em>s</em> of the mean, so after dropping the top 2.5% 
		and bottom 2.5% of the values (histogram area), the remainder should 
		span approximately 4<em>s</em>. Dividing this range by 4 should 
		approximate the standard deviation.</p>

	<p class="heading">Sketching a histogram from the mean and <em>s</em></p>
<p>Similarly, you should

		damaged when the moths break free. An experiment was conducted to estimate the mean survival time of silkworm larvae after poisoning with sodium arsenate.</p>

	<p>Since we are not interested in the specific 80 silkworms,&nbsp;we <strong>estimate</strong> that the population mean survival time is 272.6 seconds.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">9.4.5 &nbsp; Distribution of errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Error distribution</p>
	<p>When a sample statistic (such as <img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> or <span class="em black">p</span> ) is used 
		to estimate a population parameter, (<span class="black">µ</span> or <span class="black">π</span>) 
		there is an error,</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;(<span class="black em">estimate</span>  - <span class="black em">parameter</span> )</p>
	<p>Since the error depends on  random sample data, it is a random quantity and has a distribution,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/estIntro/images/errorDistnDiagram.gif" id="gif_image_4_5_1" width="429" height="85"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/estIntro/images/errorDistnDiagram.svg" id="svg_image_4_5_1" width="429" height="85" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_4_5_1");</script></p>
	<p>Although we cannot determine the actual error when there is only a single sample, it is often possible to find properties of its distribution.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>For many types of estimate, we 
		can find the error distribution or an approximation to it.</p>
	</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">9.4.6 &nbsp; Standard error and bias</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Target of small errors</p>
	<p>Consider two possible sample statistics that could be used to estimate the centre of a  symmetric population distribution &mdash; the sample mean and sample median. For each, there is an error,</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error for mean</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;<img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> - <span class="black">µ</span></p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error for median</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;<span class="em black">median</span>  - <span class="black">µ</span></p>
	<p>The best estimator will be the one whose estimation erro is usually &quot;closer to zero&quot;. This corresponds to two desirable characteristics of the error distribution.</p>
	<p class=heading>Centred on zero</p>
	<p>Ideally, we want the error distribution to be centred on zero. Such an estimator 
		is called <strong>unbiased</strong>.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/estIntro/images/estimatorComparison1.gif" id="gif_image_4_6_1" width="467" height="153"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/estIntro/images/estimatorComparison1.svg" id="svg_image_4_6_1" width="467" height="153" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_4_6_1");</script></p>
	<p>Sample means and proportions are unbiased estimators of the corresponding population parameters.</p>
	<p class=heading>Small spread</p>
	<p>Ideally, we also want error distribution to be tightly concentrated on zero 
		&mdash; i.e. to have a small spread.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/estIntro/images/estimatorComparison2.gif" id="gif_image_4_6_2" width="467" height="153"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/estIntro/images/estimatorComparison2.svg" id="svg_image_4_6_2" width="467" height="153" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_4_6_2");</script></p>
	<p>We call the standard deviation of the 
		error distribution the <strong>standard error</strong> of the estimator. We  ideally want an estimator with a <strong>small standard error</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn black"><em>standard error</em> &nbsp; 
		= &nbsp; standard deviation of the <strong>error</strong></p>
	<p>Note also that</p>
<p class="eqn black"><em>standard error</em> &nbsp; 
		= &nbsp; standard deviation of the <strong>estimator</strong></p>
<p>so a good estimator is one with a small standard deviation.
</p>



<h2 class="pageName">9.4.7 &nbsp; Interval estimates</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Describing accuracy with an interval estimate</p>
	<p>Reporting a single value as a parameter estimate (a <strong>point estimate</strong>) 
		does not convey any information about the estimator's accuracy &mdash; i.e. the 
		likely size of the estimation error.</p>
	<p>It is better to give an interval of values within which we are confident that the parameter will lie &mdash; an <strong>interval estimate</strong>. </p>
	<p class="heading">Will an interval estimate include the actual parameter value?</p>
	<p>If an interval estimate is too narrow, there will be very little chance of it containing the true parameter value, but intervals that are too wide do not convey much information.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/estIntro/images/confidence.gif" id="gif_image_4_7_1" width="363" height="166"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/estIntro/images/confidence.svg" id="svg_image_4_7_1" width="363" height="166" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_4_7_1");</script> </p>
	<p>We will later describe how to <strong>quantify</strong> this idea of &quot;confidence&quot;.</p>
