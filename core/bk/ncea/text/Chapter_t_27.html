<h1>Chapter 27 &nbsp; Estimating a Mean</h1>
<h2>27.1 &nbsp; Distribution of sample mean</h2>
<h3>27.1.1 &nbsp; Parameters and statistics</h3>
<p>A summary value describing a population is called a parameter and the corresponding value in a sample is called a statistic. Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.</p>
<h3>27.1.2 &nbsp; Variability of sample mean</h3>
<p>A sample mean has a distribution that is centred round the population mean, µ, but has smaller spread than the population's spread.</p>
<h3>27.1.3 &nbsp; Standard devn of sample mean</h3>
<p>The spread of the sample mean decreases as sample size increases. A formula is given for the standard deviation of the sample mean in terms of the sample size, n, and population standard deviation, σ.</p>
<h3>27.1.4 &nbsp; Means from normal populations</h3>
<p>Sample means from normal populations also have normal distributions.</p>
<h3>27.1.5 &nbsp; Large-sample normality of means</h3>
<p>The shape of the sample mean's distribution is usually close to normal, even if the population distribution is skew or multimodal. The bigger the sample size, the closer the distribution to normal.</p>
<h3>27.1.6 &nbsp; Distributions of sums and means</h3>
<p>The mean of a random sample is approximately normal with s.d. equal to σ divided by √n. The sum of a random sample is also approximately normal, but its s.d. is σ times √n.</p>
<h3>27.1.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Spread of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise shows the distribution of the mean or sum of values from samples of different sizes from a normal population. You must match the distributions with their sample sizes.</p>
<h3>27.1.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Shape of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise examines understanding of the limiting normal distribution of the sample mean and sum as sample size increases, whatever the shape of the population distribution.</p>
<h3>27.1.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Distribution of mean and sum (cont)</h3>
<p>In this exercise, pop-up menus are used to specify the centre, spread and skewness of the distribution of a sample mean, sample sum or a single value, given the population distribution.</p>
<h3>27.1.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities relating to means and sums</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for the probability that the mean, the sum or a single value from a sample lies within some interval. Templates are provided to help evaluate the parameters of the sampling distribution and the z-scores for the endpoints of the interval.</p>
<h2>27.2 &nbsp; Standard error of mean</h2>
<h3>27.2.1 &nbsp; Error distribution for mean</h3>
<p>When using a sample mean to estimate a population mean, the errors have a distribution with mean zero. The standard deviation of the errors (standard error) is the standard deviation of the sample mean.</p>
<h3>27.2.2 &nbsp; Standard error when σ is known</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be evaluated.</p>
<h3>27.2.3 &nbsp; Interpreting the standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error has about 95% probability of being within ±2 standard errors of zero and is almost certainly within ±3 standard errors.</p>
<h3>27.2.4 &nbsp; Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the interpretation (and value) of the standard error (SE) and standard deviation (SD).</p>
<h3>27.2.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Find standard error of mean</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will calculate the standard error of the mean from the sample mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>27.2.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for an interval containing about 95% of the values or an interval with 95% confidence of including the popn mean. The question provides either the sample standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.</p>
<h3>27.2.7 &nbsp; Exercise: What affects the standard devn and standard error?</h3>
<p>This exercise asks 3 questions about the effect of sample size and spread of sample values on the sd and se, and about the interpretation of the se and sd.</p>
<h2>27.3 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean</h2>
<h3>27.3.1 &nbsp; Confidence interval from standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error for any unbiased estimator, has approximately 0.95 probability of being between -2SE and +2SE. An approximate 95% confidence interval for the parameter is therefore the estimate ±2SE.</p>
<h3>27.3.2 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean, known σ</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be found exactly. A 95% confidence interval is the sample mean ± twice this. (Or more exactly, 1.96 times the standard error.)</p>
<h3>27.3.3 &nbsp; Confidence level</h3>
<p>A simulation shows that 95% confidence intervals are random -- they vary from sample to sample. About 95% of samples give confidence intervals that include the true parameter.</p>
<h3>27.3.4 &nbsp; Exercise: Find approx 95% CI from standard error</h3>
<p>This exercise displays an estimate and standard error and asks for an approximate 95% confidence interval. Various different types of parameters are estimated (not just means).</p>
<h3>27.3.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Find confidence intervals, known &sigma;</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice with the calculations for finding the 95% confidence interval for a mean when the population standard deviation is known.</p>
<h3>27.3.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</p>
