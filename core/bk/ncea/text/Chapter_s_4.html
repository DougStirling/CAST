<p>These three data sets  have the <strong>same basic structure</strong>, so the
same statistical methods  can be applied to all of them. </p>
<p class="heading">Variables and 'individuals'</p>
<p>Most data sets have a fairly simple structure. One or more measurements (<strong>'variables'</strong>)
are recorded from each of a collection of '<strong>individuals</strong>' (also called <strong>'cases'</strong> or
 '<strong><strong>units</strong></strong>'). The data can 
be presented in a  <strong>data matrix</strong>. </p>

<h2 class="pageName">4.1.2 &nbsp; Types of variable</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>Most variables in a data set are either numerical or categorical.</p>
<p class=heading>Numerical variables</p>
<p>These have values that are <strong>numbers</strong> and can 
	be further classified into:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Discrete numerical variable</dt>
	<dd>A variable whose values are <strong>whole numbers</strong> (counts) is 
		called discrete.</dd>
	<dt>Continuous numerical variable</dt>
	<dd>A variable that may contain <strong>any value within some range</strong> is called continuous.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Statistical methods that can be used for continuous variables are not always 
	appropriate for discrete variables.</p>
<p class=heading>Categorical variables</p>
<p>The values of a <strong>categorical</strong> variable are selected from a 
	small group of categories. A further classification is:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Ordinal categorical variable</dt>
	<dd>This arises when the  categories can be<strong> meaningfully ordered</strong>.</dd>
	<dt>Nominal categorical variable</dt>
	<dd>If it does not matter which way its categories are ordered, the variable is
called nominal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most statistical methods for categorical data can be applied to both ordinal 
	and nominal variables.</p>
<p class=heading>Labels</p>
<p>In some data sets, each individual has a unique 'name' that can be used to 
	identify it. We call this a <strong>label variable</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading><span class="blue">Warning!</span></p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When you see a column of numbers in your data matrix, do not 
			assume that it is a numerical variable.</p>

<p>Numbers are sometimes used as <strong>codes</strong> for categorical or label variables.</p>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Outliers</p>
	<p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data are 
		called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
	<p>An outlier may have been 
		incorrectly recorded, or there may have been other anomalous circumstances
associated with it. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything
atypical can be found, outliers should be deleted from the data set and their
deletion noted in any reports about the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Outliers and skew distributions</p>
	<p>Deciding whether a value is an outlier or not is affected by the shape of
the distribution of values for the rest of the data.</p>

		<dd>A distribution with a long tail to one side is called a <strong>skew</strong> distribution
&mdash; positively skew if the long tail is to the right and negatively skew if the
long tail is to the left. It  is not unusual for the extreme value in a very
skew distribution to be a  fair distance from the other values and may not be
an outlier.</dd>

<h2 class="pageName">4.2.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>If a dot plot, stem and leaf plot or histogram separates into two or more
groups of  values (clusters), this suggests that there may be more fundamental
differences between the 'individuals' in the groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_clusters.gif" width="499" height="140"></p>
	<p>Further investigation	should be made of	the individuals in the  clusters to find whether they also differ in other ways.</p>
	<p>If the clusters were less distinct, especially in small data sets, you would need external supporting evidence before concluding that the individuals separated into meaningful groups.</p>

  


<h2 class="pageName">4.2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Distribution of values</p>
	<p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, the <strong>distribution
of values</strong>  also contains useful information. Important features
are:</p>
<ul>
		<li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
		<li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
		<li>Whether a distribution is <strong>symmetric</strong> or  <strong>skew</strong> — do the tails appear similar at both sides?</li>
		<li>Other aspects of the <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 
		concepts of centre and spread are particularly important.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.2.4 &nbsp; Names of individuals</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Extra information</p>
<p>When only a single value is known from each individual (or plant, item, etc),
all that can be discovered is the shape of the distribution of these values.</p>
<p>Additional information  about each individuals
may give insight into why some values are bigger or smaller than others. Different
types of information may be available. The simplest is a unique <strong>name</strong> for
the individuals &mdash; a textual label. These names may help us to understand why
values are outliers or group into clusters in a 
dot plot or stem and leaf plot.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.2.5 &nbsp; Distinguishing known groups</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Multiple groups of individuals</p>
<p>Sometimes we know that the individuals belong to two or more groups before
the data are collected or, equivalently, that they have different values of an
extra categorical variable.</p>
<p>Information about groups is best displayed by plotting the separate groups
against a common axis.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_stackedGroups.gif" width="399" height="348"></p>
<p class="heading">Back-to-back stem and leaf plots</p>
<p>Stem and leaf plots can be used to compare two groups of individuals,
if drawn on different
sides of a common column of stems. (They are less useful if there are three or
more groups.)</p>

<p>Be careful <strong>not to overinterpret</strong> patterns in small

<p class="heading">Population and census</p>
	<p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
		fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
		group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
	<p>Collecting measurements  from every item in the  population is called a <strong>census</strong>. A census is rarely feasible,  because of the  cost and time involved.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
	<p>We can usually obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
	collecting information from a selection of units from the population &mdash; a <strong>sample</strong>. Although a sample gives less accurate information than a census, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample  is  
		a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In it, each unit has the same chance 
		of being selected and some random mechanism is used to determine whether any particular unit is 
		included in the sample.	</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	<p>It is convenient 
		to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
		than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
		corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>

<p class="heading">Different sampling schemes</p>
	<p><strong>Two

	<dl>
		<dt>Sampling with replacement (SWR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWR, the first selected value is <strong>returned to the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from all <i>N</i> population values. </dd>
		<dt>Sampling without replacement (SWOR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWOR, the first selected value is <strong>removed from the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from the remaining <i>N</i> - 1 population 
		values, etc.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Since a SWR may contain the same population value more than once, it covers less of the population than SWOR. SWOR therefore gives more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Large populations and/or small samples</p>
	<p>If the sample size, <i>n</i>, is much smaller than the population size, <i>N</i>, 
		there is little practical difference between SWR and SWOR &mdash; there would be little
