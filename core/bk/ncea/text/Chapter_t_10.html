<h1>Chapter 10 &nbsp; Conduct Experiment (2.10)</h1>
<h2>10.1 &nbsp; Association &amp; causal relationships</h2>
<h3>10.1.1 &nbsp; Interest in relationships</h3>
<p>For most data sets, we are interested in understanding the relationships between the variables. However interpreting relationships must be done with care.</p>
<h3>10.1.2 &nbsp; Causal and non-causal relationships</h3>
<p>If the relationship between X and Y is causal, it is possible to predict the effect of changing the value of X.</p>
<h3>10.1.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h3>
<p>Causality can only be deduced from how the data were collected â€” the data values themselves do not contain any information about causality.</p>
<h3>10.1.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h3>
<p>In an observational study, values are passively recorded from individuals. Experiments are characterised by the experimenter's control over the values of one or more variables.</p>
<h3>10.1.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h3>
<p>Causal relationships can only be deduced from well-designed experiments.</p>
<h2>10.2 &nbsp; Practical issues in design</h2>
<h3>10.2.1 &nbsp; Purpose</h3>
<p>Why is the experiment being conducted and how will the results be used?</p>
<h3>10.2.2 &nbsp; Experimental units and measurements</h3>
<p>In an experiment, what experimental units will be used? What response variable will be recorded? Which variables will be controlled?</p>
<h3>10.2.3 &nbsp; Experiments with human subjects</h3>
<p>Other practical issues are involved when conducting experiments on human subjects.</p>
