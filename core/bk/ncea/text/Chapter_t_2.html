<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Looking at Numbers</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Graphical display of values</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Analysing variation</h3>
<p>Meaningful information can be obtained from variation in the values of a variable.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Basic dot plot</h3>
<p>A dot plot displays each value as a cross along a numerical axis</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h3>
<p>Jittering is a modification to the basic dot plot that avoids some problems associated with overlapping crosses</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h3>
<p>Stacking of the crosses is an alternative to jittering that highlights ranges of high or low density.</p>
<h3>2.1.5 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>Stem and leaf plots are similar to stacked dot plots, but a digit is used instead of a cross to retain extra information.</p>
<h3>2.1.6 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>For data analysis, stem and leaf plots are rarely more informative than stacked dot plots, but they are easy to draw by hand.</p>
<h3>2.1.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw stem and leaf plot</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will drag leaves to form a stem and leaf plot from a list of values.</p>
<h3>2.1.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Complete stacked dot plot</h3>
<p>You should never need to draw a stacked dot plot by hand, but this exercise checks that you understand how the values are represented -- it asks you to drag the final two crosses of a stacked dot plot into the correct places of the display.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Histograms and density</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Density of values</h3>
<p>The heights of the stacks of leaves in a stem and leaf plot or crosses in a dot plot describe the density of values.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h3>
<p>In a simple histogram, the height of the rectangle above each class on the axis equals the number of values in the class -- the class frequency.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h3>
<p>Class width and start-point should be chosen to make the histogram as smooth as possible -- neither too blocky nor too jagged.</p>
<h3>2.2.4 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h3>
<p>The shape of a histogram can be very dependent on the choice of classes if the data set is small; beware over-interpreting its shape. Stacked dot plots are a better display of small data sets.</p>
<h3>2.2.5 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h3>
<p>The vertical axis should be relative frequency, not frequency, when comparing two groups with histograms. Population pyramids are often used to compare age distributions.</p>
<h3>2.2.6 &nbsp; Frequency polygons</h3>
<p>Frequency polygons are closely related to histograms but give a less 'blocky' display of density. Different groups can be compared more easily with them.</p>
<h3>2.2.7 &nbsp; Drawing histograms by hand</h3>
<p>Histograms are based on frequency tables. Class boundaries should avoid possible data values.</p>
<h3>2.2.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a histogram</h3>
<p>In this page, you will draw histograms of different data sets.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Median, quartiles & box plots</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h3>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain detailed information that is distracting when two or more data sets are being compared.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h3>
<p>The median and quartiles split a batch of values into four equal-sized sets of values. A box plot is a graphical display of the median, quartiles and extremes.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Interpreting a box plot's shape</h3>
<p>A box plot clearly shows the centre, spread and skewness of a data set. It splits the corresponding histogram into 4 approximately equal areas.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a box plot</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page involves drawing box plots from sorted lists of values.</p>
<h3>2.3.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Shape of a box plot</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page involve matching the shape of box plots to the corresponding dot plots.</p>
<h2>2.4 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2>
<h3>2.4.1 &nbsp; More than one variable</h3>
<p>Many data sets contain two or more measurements from each individual. Even when the main interest is in one variable, the others can help to understand its distribution.</p>
<h3>2.4.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h3>
<p>The main display that shows the relationship between two variables is a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>2.4.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h3>
<p>Univariate displays don't show relationships between variables.</p>
<h3>2.4.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>A scatterplot of two variables can be enhanced with box plots or histograms on the margins of a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>2.4.5 &nbsp; Time series</h3>
<p>When a single measurement is made at regular intervals, the data are called a time series. Time series data can be treated as bivariate, with time being the second variable.</p>
<h3>2.4.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a scatterplot</h3>
<p>It is more important that you can interpret a scatterplot than draw one by hand. However in this exercise, you will complete a scatterplot by dragging the crosses for the last two observations in a data set -- it checks that you understand how the crosses correspond to the values.</p>
