<h2 class="pageName">8.1.1 &nbsp; Other sampling schemes</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>Although a simple random sample  is conceptually
the easiest sampling scheme, there are sometimes advantages to selecting
a sample in different ways.</p>
<p class="heading">Separate samples from different groups</p>
<p>In a <strong>stratified random sample</strong>, the individuals in the population
are split into different groups (called <strong>strata</strong>). A separate
simple random sample is selected from each stratum.</p>
<p>If the strata differ from each other, a stratified random sample is more accurate
than a simple random sample.</p>
<p class="heading">Cluster samples</p>
<p>It is often cheaper to sample <strong>groups</strong> of related individuals
called <strong>clusters</strong>. For example, houses are often sampled with
questions asked from all members of the selected households.</p>
<p>Although estimates will be less accurate than from a simple random sample
of the same number of individuals, the reduced cost may allow more individuals
to be sampled.</p>
<p class="heading">Systematic samples</p>
<p>A systematic sample is done when the individuals can be listed in order.
For example, when sampling items for defects in the output of a production line,
every 100th item may be inspected.</p>
<p>A systematic sample is easier to implement for the person collecting the data.</p>


<h2 class="pageName">8.1.2 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Estimation</p>
	<p>The aim of sampling is usually to <strong>estimate</strong> one or more population 
		values (parameters) from a sample. Because we do not have complete information about the population, the estimate is unlikely to be <strong>exactly</strong> same as the value that we are estimating, 
		so we call the difference the <strong>error</strong> in the estimate. There are 
		different kinds of error.</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling error</p>
	<p>We have presented four different ways to sample from a population</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Simple random sample</li>
		<li>Stratified sample</li>
		<li>Cluster sample</li>
		<li>Two-stage sample</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each of these involves randomness in the sample-selection process. The error caused by randomness in the sampling process is called <strong>sampling 
			error</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Non-sampling error</p>
	<p>When sampling from some types of population &mdash; especially human populations 
		&mdash; problems often arise when conducting one of the above sampling schemes. For 
		example, some sampled people are likely to refuse to participate in your study.</p>
	<p>Such difficulties also result in errors and these are called <strong>non-sampling 
		errors</strong>. Non-sampling errors can be much higher than sampling errors 
		and are much more serious. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike sampling errors, the likely size of non-sampling errors cannot be estimated 
			from a single sample &mdash; it is extremely difficult to assess their likely size.</li>
		<li>Non-sampling errors often distort estimates by pulling them in one direction. 
			The estimates are then called <strong>biased</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is therefore important to design a survey to minimise the risk of non-sampling 
		errors.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.3 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
	<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
		from some members of the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>
	<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
		the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
		the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
		only a subgroup of it.</p>
	<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>
	<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Failure to contact the individuals.</li>
		<li>Refusal to participate in the study.</li>
		<li>Refusal to answer particular questions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
		survey are likely to be biased.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.4 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>'Inaccurate' responses</p>
	<p>The next two types of non-sampling error are caused by inaccurate information 
		being obtained from the sampled individuals.</p>
	<p class=heading>Instrument error</p>
	<p><strong>Instrument error</strong> usually results from poorly designed
		questions. Different wording of questions can lead to different answers being 
		given by a respondent. The wording of the question may be such as to elicit some
		particular response (a <strong>leading</strong> question) or it may simply be carelessly
		worded so that it is misinterpreted by some respondents. </p>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer error</p>
	<p><strong>Interviewer error</strong> occurs when some characteristic of the interviewer, such
		as age or sex, affects the way in which respondents answer questions.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.5 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>There are various different ways to collect information from human populations. 
	Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
	<p class=heading>Telephone</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response can be high.</li>
		<li>Coverage error is small.</li>
		<li>The number of questions must be kept very small.</li>
		<li>Inexpensive, so sample sizes can be greater.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Mailed questionnaire</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response is very high.</li>
		<li>Costs are higher than in a telephone survey.</li>
		<li>Mailed questionnaires can contain more questions than telephone surveys.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lowest non-response and other sampling errors.</li>
		<li>Interviewers must be well trained to reduce interviewer error.</li>
		<li>Most expensive.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires can be fairly long.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Houses are rarely selected at random. Often streets are randomly selected and every
		5th or 10th house in the street is approached. This is called a <strong>systematic
			sample</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Street corner</p>
	<p>Some surveys are conducted by approaching people in busy shopping centres or
		similar public places. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Large coverage errors.</li>
		<li>Least expensive and therefore widely used.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires must be small.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To reduce coverage errors, a <strong>quota sample</strong> is often used. Each 
		interviewer is told to interview fixed numbers of old, young, male, female, etc. 
		respondents to match the 
		corresponding proportion in the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Self-selected</p>
	<p>Phone-in or mail-in surveys are often conducted by radio stations and magazines. The
		respondents are usually so unrepresentative that the results are meaningless. These types
		of survey should be avoided. </p>
