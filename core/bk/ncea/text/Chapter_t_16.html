<h1>Chapter 16 &nbsp; Formal Inference (3.10)</h1>
<h2>16.1 &nbsp; Distribution of sample mean</h2>
<h3>16.1.1 &nbsp; Parameters and statistics</h3>
<p>A summary value describing a population is called a parameter and the corresponding value in a sample is called a statistic. Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.</p>
<h3>16.1.2 &nbsp; Variability of sample mean</h3>
<p>A sample mean has a distribution that is centred round the population mean, µ, but has smaller spread than the population's spread.</p>
<h3>16.1.3 &nbsp; Standard devn of sample mean</h3>
<p>The spread of the sample mean decreases as sample size increases. A formula is given for the standard deviation of the sample mean in terms of the sample size, n, and population standard deviation, σ.</p>
<h3>16.1.4 &nbsp; Means from normal populations</h3>
<p>Sample means from normal populations also have normal distributions.</p>
<h3>16.1.5 &nbsp; Large-sample normality of means</h3>
<p>The shape of the sample mean's distribution is usually close to normal, even if the population distribution is skew or multimodal. The bigger the sample size, the closer the distribution to normal.</p>
<h3>16.1.6 &nbsp; Distributions of sums and means</h3>
<p>The mean of a random sample is approximately normal with s.d. equal to σ divided by √n. The sum of a random sample is also approximately normal, but its s.d. is σ times √n.</p>
<h3>16.1.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Spread of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise shows the distribution of the mean or sum of values from samples of different sizes from a normal population. You must match the distributions with their sample sizes.</p>
<h3>16.1.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Shape of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise examines understanding of the limiting normal distribution of the sample mean and sum as sample size increases, whatever the shape of the population distribution.</p>
<h3>16.1.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Distribution of mean and sum (cont)</h3>
<p>In this exercise, pop-up menus are used to specify the centre, spread and skewness of the distribution of a sample mean, sample sum or a single value, given the population distribution.</p>
<h3>16.1.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities relating to means and sums</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for the probability that the mean, the sum or a single value from a sample lies within some interval. Templates are provided to help evaluate the parameters of the sampling distribution and the z-scores for the endpoints of the interval.</p>
<h2>16.2 &nbsp; Standard error of mean</h2>
<h3>16.2.1 &nbsp; Error distribution for mean</h3>
<p>When using a sample mean to estimate a population mean, the errors have a distribution with mean zero. The standard deviation of the errors (standard error) is the standard deviation of the sample mean.</p>
<h3>16.2.2 &nbsp; Standard error when σ is known</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be evaluated.</p>
<h3>16.2.3 &nbsp; Interpreting the standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error has about 95% probability of being within ±2 standard errors of zero and is almost certainly within ±3 standard errors.</p>
<h3>16.2.4 &nbsp; Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the interpretation (and value) of the standard error (SE) and standard deviation (SD).</p>
<h3>16.2.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Find standard error of mean</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will calculate the standard error of the mean from the sample mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>16.2.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for an interval containing about 95% of the values or an interval with 95% confidence of including the popn mean. The question provides either the sample standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.</p>
<h3>16.2.7 &nbsp; Exercise: What affects the standard devn and standard error?</h3>
<p>This exercise asks 3 questions about the effect of sample size and spread of sample values on the sd and se, and about the interpretation of the se and sd.</p>
<h2>16.3 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean</h2>
<h3>16.3.1 &nbsp; Confidence interval from standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error for any unbiased estimator, has approximately 0.95 probability of being between -2SE and +2SE. An approximate 95% confidence interval for the parameter is therefore the estimate ±2SE.</p>
<h3>16.3.2 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean, known σ</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be found exactly. A 95% confidence interval is the sample mean ± twice this. (Or more exactly, 1.96 times the standard error.)</p>
<h3>16.3.3 &nbsp; Confidence level</h3>
<p>A simulation shows that 95% confidence intervals are random -- they vary from sample to sample. About 95% of samples give confidence intervals that include the true parameter.</p>
<h3>16.3.4 &nbsp; Exercise: Find approx 95% CI from standard error</h3>
<p>This exercise displays an estimate and standard error and asks for an approximate 95% confidence interval. Various different types of parameters are estimated (not just means).</p>
<h3>16.3.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Find confidence intervals, known &sigma;</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice with the calculations for finding the 95% confidence interval for a mean when the population standard deviation is known.</p>
<h3>16.3.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</p>
<h2>16.4 &nbsp; Estimating proportions</h2>
<h3>16.4.1 &nbsp; General framework for estimation</h3>
<p>The methodology for describing the accuracy of a sample mean using standard errors and confidence intervals can also be used for other parameter estimates.</p>
<h3>16.4.2 &nbsp; Estimating a proportion</h3>
<p>A sample proportion estimates the corresponding population proportion, π. There is likely to be an error in this estimate and these errors have a distribution.</p>
<h3>16.4.3 &nbsp; Error distribution</h3>
<p>The estimation errors have a type of binomial distribution that is scaled to have mean zero. Its standard deviation is the standard error of the proportion.</p>
<h3>16.4.4 &nbsp; Normal approximation to error distribution</h3>
<p>If the sample size is high enough, the error distribution is approximately normal. This page gives a few examples for which the error distribution is found.</p>
<h3>16.4.5 &nbsp; Confidence interval for proportion</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence interval for a population proportion is the sample proportion ± 1.96 times its standard deviation. Its confidence level is only approximately 95% and guidelines are given for the minimum sample size.</p>
<h3>16.4.6 &nbsp; Properties of 95% CI for proportion</h3>
<p>If samples are repeatedly taken, about 95% of them result in 95% confidence intervals that include the population proportion. Guidelines are given for the minimum sample size to make the confidence level close to 95%.</p>
<h3>16.4.7 &nbsp; Confidence interval examples</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence intervals for a proportion are found and interpreted for several data sets.</p>
<h3>16.4.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Find standard error of proportion</h3>
<p>A template is provided in this exercise to help evaluate the standard error of a sample proportion.</p>
<h3>16.4.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Find 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice at evaluating an approximate 95% confidence interval for a probability.</p>
<h3>16.4.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise presents 3 different statements about a 95% confidence interval and asks which is correct.</p>
<h2>16.5 &nbsp; More about estimation</h2>
<h3>16.5.1 &nbsp; Margin of error</h3>
<p>The margin of error for a survey is related to a confidence interval. It is close to a 95% CI when p is 0.5, but underestimates the accuracy of small or large sample proportions.</p>
<h3>16.5.2 &nbsp; Sample size for estimating mean</h3>
<p>Given a target width for a 95% confidence interval, it is possible to determine the necessary sample size to achieve this accuracy.</p>
<h3>16.5.3 &nbsp; Sample size for estimating proportion</h3>
<p>In a similar way, given a target width for a 95% confidence interval for a proportion, it is possible to determine the necessary sample size.</p>
<h3>16.5.4 &nbsp; Other confidence levels</h3>
<p>All earlier confidence intervals had 95% confidence level. Replacing 1.96 (or 2) with other values gives interval estimates with different confidence levels.</p>
<h3>16.5.5 &nbsp; Exercise: CIs for &micro; with other confidence levels</h3>
<p>In this exercise, confidence intervals for a mean are requested with a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels.</p>
<h3>16.5.6 &nbsp; Exercise: CIs for &pi; with other confidence levels</h3>
<p>This exercise requests a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence intervals for a probability. A normal density can be used to find the relevant z-score and a template helps evaluate the 'plus-minus' value.</p>
<h3>16.5.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Factors affecting CI width of CI for &micro;</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, sample standard deviation and confidence level affect the width of a CI for the mean.</p>
<h3>16.5.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Factors affecting width of CI for &pi;</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, confidence level and population probability affect the width of a CI for the probability.</p>
<h2>16.6 &nbsp; Comparing means in two groups</h2>
<h3>16.6.1 &nbsp; Distn of difference between means</h3>
<p>The difference between the means of two samples from normal populations has a normal distribution whose mean and s.d. can be found from the population means and s.d.s. This is the approximate distribution even when the populations are non-normal.</p>
<h3>16.6.2 &nbsp; SE of difference between means</h3>
<p>When the difference between the sample means is used to estimate the difference between the underlying population means, there is likely to be an error. The error distribution is approximately normal with mean 0. A formula for its standard deviation is given.</p>
