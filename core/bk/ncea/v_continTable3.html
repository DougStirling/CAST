<p class="heading">Proportions within groups</p>

<p>Although a contingency table fully describes categorical data from two or more 
groups, it is a poor way to compare the distributions if there are different total 
numbers in the groups.</p>
<p>Rather than tabulating the frequencies for each group, it is more informative 
to tabulate the <strong>proportions within the groups</strong>. Each frequency 
in the table is therefore divided by the <strong>total for that group</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, in the health and contraception data on the previous page,</p>
<ul>
<li>12 of the women aged 16-29 who did not use contraception did so because they
wanted to become pregnant, but</li>
<li>28 of those aged 30-39 gave this as their reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>However since there were many more in the 30-39 age group, it is more meaningful
to report that</p>
<ul>
<li>a proportion <sup>12</sup>/<sub>57</sub> = 0.21 of those aged 16-29 did so
to become pregnant, whereas</li>
<li>only <sup>28</sup>/<sub>166</sub> = 0.17 of those aged 30-39 gave this as
their reason.</li>
</ul>
