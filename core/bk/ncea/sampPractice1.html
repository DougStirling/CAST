<p class="heading">Alternatives to simple random samples</p>

<p>A simple random sample of individuals from some population is conceptually 
the easiest sampling scheme. However there are sometimes advantages to selecting a sample in different ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>More accurate estimates of population characteristics may be obtained.</li>
	<li>The cost of sampling may be reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few alternative sampling schemes are described below.</p>
<p class="heading">Separate samples from different groups</p>
<p>If the individuals in the population can be split into different groups (called 
<strong>strata</strong> in sampling terminology), it is often better to take a 
simple random sample <strong>within each separate group</strong> than to sample 
randomly from the whole population. This is called a <strong>stratified random 
sample</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, a simple random sample of 40 students from a class of 200 males 
and 200 females might (by chance) include 25 males and 15 females. A stratified 
random sample would randomly select 20 males and 20 females, ensuring that the 
sex-ratio in the sample matched that in the population.</p>
<p>The benefits from stratified random sampling are greatest if the measurement 
being sampled is different in the different strata. For example, we might want 
to estimate the mean summer income of the students. If male students tend to have 
higher incomes than female students, a stratified random sample based on gender 
will be more accurate than a simple random sample.</p>

<p class="heading">Cluster samples</p>
<p>It is often cheaper to sample <strong>groups</strong> of related individuals called <strong>clusters</strong>. For example, in a sample of individuals in a town, it costs much less to sample 40 households and collect information from each adult in the sampled households than to sample and record information from a random sample of 100 adults in the town, even though the number of individuals samples is the same in both cases.</p>
<p>Although estimates will be less accurate than from a simple random sample of the same number of individuals, the reduced cost may allow more individuals to be sampled.</p>
<p class="heading">Systematic samples</p>
<p>A systematic sample is often used for simplicity when the individuals can be arranged in order. Rather than randomly deciding which individuals to sample, the sampled individuals are evenly spaced out. This sampling scheme is particularly simple for the person conducting the survey.</p>
<p>For example, in a household survey, every 10th house may be sampled in each street. When sampling items for defects in the output of a production line, every 100th item may be inspected.</p>

	<p>Warning: it is harder to assess the accuracy of estimates obtained from these alternative sampling schemes than from simple random sampling.
