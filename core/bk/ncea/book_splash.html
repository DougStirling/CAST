<p>Welcome to the <em>CAST</em> e-book for  students who are studying  the New Zealand <em>National Certificate of Educational Achievement</em> (NCEA). The e-book provides a dynamic and interactive way to learn some important parts of the New Zealand curriculum and includes some exercises that will help the learning process.</p>
<p class="heading">Coverage of the curriculum</p>
<p>This e-book does not cover everything in the curriculum or that must be learned for the NCEA assessments. It  provides coverage of <strong>many</strong> of the methods and concepts in the curriculum but you should be aware that it is incomplete.</p>
<p class="heading">Teaching approach</p>
<p>The approach taken in this e-book is method-based and deals with the statistical concepts and techniques required at each level of the curriculum in a logical order. This approach is good for revision and reference but <strong>we do not recommend it as the basis of classroom teaching</strong>. In the classroom, a data-motivated approach is better.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>Statistics is only important because it can answer important questions about real-life data and problems.</p>
</div>
<p> We therefore recommend that teachers introduce each topic with data sets and problems. Statistical methods should be introduced as required to deal with the data. The material in this e-book can then provide detailed information about these methods.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>This e-book is intended for self-study and is fairly self-contained. A companion <a href="javascript:openEbook('nceax')"><strong>e-book for NCEA teachers</strong></a> contains only the interactive diagrams and is intended for classroom use with a data projector.</p>
