<page dir="bk/ncea" filePrefix="probDensity4" summaryDir="en/probDensity" summaryFilePrefix="s_probDensity4" videoDir="en/probDensity" videoFilePrefix="v_probDensity4">Infinite continuous numerical populations are described with a type of histogram called a probability density function.</page>
<page dir="bk/ncea" filePrefix="probDensity5" summaryDir="en/probDensity" summaryFilePrefix="s_probDensity5" videoDir="en/probDensity" videoFilePrefix="v_probDensity5">Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters, &amp;micro; and &amp;sigma;, can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</page>
<page dir="en/probDensity" filePrefix="probDensity6" summaryDir="en/probDensity" summaryFilePrefix="s_probDensity6" videoDir="en/probDensity" videoFilePrefix="v_probDensity6">When a value is sampled from an infinite continuous population, the probability that it is between a and b equals the area under the p.d.f. between these two values.</page>

<page dir="en/probSim" filePrefix="e_probSim4" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Estimate probability from pdf">In this exercise, probabilities are obtained from the areas under a probability density function.</page>
