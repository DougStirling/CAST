	<p>This section is based on fitting a straight line (or curve) to the data in a time series plot. Methods for fitting  lines to data are described in much more detail in a <a href="javascript:top.showNamedPage('leastSqrs')">section about Least Squares</a> in the NCEA unit <em>S3.5 Bivariate Data</em>, so we recommend that you read that section while studying the first page below.</p>

<page dir="en/trend" filePrefix="trend1" summaryDir="en/trend" summaryFilePrefix="s_trend1" videoDir="en/trend" videoFilePrefix="v_trend1">Many time series steadily increase or decrease over time and a linear model may describe the trend. This kind of model can be fitted by least squares.</page>
<page dir="en/trend" filePrefix="trend2" summaryDir="en/trend" summaryFilePrefix="s_trend2" videoDir="en/trend" videoFilePrefix="v_trend2">If the trend is nonlinear, a quadratic model might describe the trend better and can also be fitted by least squares.</page>
<page dir="en/trend" filePrefix="trend3" summaryDir="en/trend" summaryFilePrefix="s_trend3" videoDir="en/trend" videoFilePrefix="v_trend3">Linear and quadratic models can be used to forecast future values.</page>
