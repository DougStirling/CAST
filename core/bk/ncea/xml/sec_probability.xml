<page dir="en/probDensity" filePrefix="probDensity1" summaryDir="en/probDensity" summaryFilePrefix="s_probDensity1" videoDir="en/probDensity" videoFilePrefix="v_probDensity1">When randomly selecting one value from a population of N different values, the probability of getting any individual value is 1/N. More generally, the probability of sampling a value in any range is the proportion of population values in the range.</page>
<page dir="en/probDensity" filePrefix="probDensity2" summaryDir="en/probDensity" summaryFilePrefix="s_probDensity2" videoDir="en/probDensity" videoFilePrefix="v_probDensity2">The probability of any type of value is again the proportion of such values in the population. It can also be interpreted as the limiting proportion from a sample of values if the sample size is increased indefinitely.</page>
<page dir="en/probDensity" filePrefix="probDensity3" summaryDir="en/probDensity" summaryFilePrefix="s_probDensity3" videoDir="en/probDensity" videoFilePrefix="v_probDensity3">Infinite categorical or discrete populations can be described by bar charts of the probabilities.</page>
<page dir="en/density" filePrefix="density5" summaryDir="en/density" summaryFilePrefix="s_density5" videoDir="en/density" videoFilePrefix="v_density5">In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</page>

<page dir="en/probSim" filePrefix="e_probSim2" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Probabilities and finite populations">A finite categorical population is shown as a bar chart and the probability of a randomly sampled value being in a range of categories must be found.</page>
<page dir="en/probSim" filePrefix="e_probSim3" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Probabilities and numerical population">This exercise is simlar to the one on the previous page but relates to a numerical population that is summarised by a histogram. The probability must be estimated roughly 'by eye' from the area under the histogram.</page>
