<page dir="en/prob" filePrefix="prob1" summaryDir="en/prob" summaryFilePrefix="s_prob1" videoDir="en/prob" videoFilePrefix="v_prob1">Bivariate categorical data are modelled as a sample from a population that consists of pairs of categorical values. The joint probability for any pair of categories is their population proportion.</page>
<page dir="en/prob" filePrefix="prob2" summaryDir="en/prob" summaryFilePrefix="s_prob2" videoDir="en/prob" videoFilePrefix="v_prob2">The marginal probabilities for a variable are the population proportions for its possible values. They can be found by summing joint probabilities.</page>
<page dir="en/prob" filePrefix="prob3" summaryDir="en/prob" summaryFilePrefix="s_prob3" videoDir="en/prob" videoFilePrefix="v_prob3">Conditional probabilites for a variable are proportions in a sub-population containing a specific value for the other variable. They are found by scaling the joint probabilities in that sub-population.</page>
<page dir="en/prob" filePrefix="prob4" summaryDir="en/prob" summaryFilePrefix="s_prob4" videoDir="en/prob" videoFilePrefix="v_prob4">Joint, marginal and conditional probabilities can be displayed graphically.</page>

<page dir="en/probSim" filePrefix="e_probSim1" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Probabilities for cards and dice">This exercise asks for probabilities about a card drawn at random from a standard pack of playing cards or when two dice are rolled.</page>
<page dir="en/probSim" filePrefix="e_probSim5" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Sampling with and without replacement">This exercise relates to pairs of numbers drawn with or without replacement from a small finite population. The question asks for a probability about either the sum or difference of the two numbers.</page>
