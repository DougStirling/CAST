<topText><![CDATA[
	<p>Many teachers at NCEA level 1 only cover histograms in which all classes have equal widths and class height can therefore be equal to frequency. Some teachers explain how to draw histograms with unequal class widths to their better students. All students should however understand the relationship between the proportion of values in the histogram classes and histogram area.</p>

<page dir="en/density" filePrefix="density5" summaryDir="en/density" summaryFilePrefix="s_density5" videoDir="en/density" videoFilePrefix="v_density5">In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</page>
<page dir="en/density" filePrefix="density7" note="Advanced" summaryDir="en/density" summaryFilePrefix="s_density7" videoDir="en/density" videoFilePrefix="v_density7">If a histogram has varying class widths, the vertical axis must be 'density'. The histogram shape would be misleading if frequency or relative frequency was used for the vertical axis.</page>
<page dir="en/density" filePrefix="density8" summaryDir="en/density" summaryFilePrefix="s_density8" videoDir="en/density" videoFilePrefix="v_density8">Whether or not class widths are equal, the proportion of values in any classes always equals the proportion of the total histogram area that is above the classes.</page>

<page dir="bk/ncea" filePrefix="e_densityMore1" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Draw histogram with mixed class widths">In this page, you will draw histograms of different data sets.</page>
<page dir="en/density" filePrefix="e_density2" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Histogram areas and proportions">The two exercises in this page ask you to use the shape of a histogram to find the proportion of values in a given range. The first exercise shows the number of values in each class, but the second requires the histogram area to be estimated 'by eye'.</page>
