<page dir="bk/ncea" filePrefix="correlation3" summaryDir="bk/ncea" summaryFilePrefix="s_correlation3" videoDir="bk/ncea" videoFilePrefix="v_correlation3">The correlation coefficient summarises the strength of the relationship between X and Y. It is +1 when the scatterplot crosses are on a straight line with positive slope, -1 when on a line with negative slope, and zero when X and Y are unrelated.</page>
<page dir="en/correlation" filePrefix="correlation5" summaryDir="en/correlation" summaryFilePrefix="s_correlation5" videoDir="en/correlation" videoFilePrefix="v_correlation5">The correlation coefficient is only a good measure of the strength of a relationship if the points in a scatterplot are scattered round a straight line, not a curve.</page>
<page dir="en/correlation" filePrefix="correlation6" summaryDir="en/correlation" summaryFilePrefix="s_correlation6" videoDir="en/correlation" videoFilePrefix="v_correlation6">The correlation coefficient cannot identify curvature, outliers or clusters and can be misleading if these features are present. A scatterplot must always be examined too.</page>

<page dir="en/correlation" filePrefix="e_correlation1" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Estimate r by eye">In this exercise, you will make a rough estimate of correlation coefficient by eye from a scatterplot.</page>
<page dir="en/correlation" filePrefix="e_correlation2" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#r for non-standard data">This exercise presents four scatterplots (one elliptical, one with an outlier, one with two clusters and one with curvature) and asks for these to be matched with the corresponding values of r.</page>
