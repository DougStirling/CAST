<p class="heading">Tree diagrams for two attributes</p>

<p>Two categorical variables (or types of event) are sometimes represented in a type of diagram called a <strong>tree diagram</strong>. In this diagram, we think of the measurements as being observed <strong>in sequence</strong>. The  main branches of the tree correspond to the possible values for the first of these measurements. At the end of each of these branches, further branches are drawn for each possible value for the second measurement.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tree_marital2.gif" width="266" height="310"></p>
<p>The main branches are usually labeled with their <strong>marginal</strong> probabilities. The branches to the right are labeled with their <strong>conditional</strong> probabilities, conditional on the branches to the left leading to that fork.</p>
<p class="heading">Evaluating joint probabilities</p>
<p>The main use of tree diagrams is to evaluate <strong>joint</strong> probabilities. To obtain any joint probability, multiply the probabilities down the corresponding branches. This corresponds to applying the general multiplication rule, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B | A).</p>

	<p class="heading">Bruising of apples</p>
	<p>The contingency table below describes bruising of 96 apples in a packing plant. 
		The apples were classified by the variety of apple (Granny Smith or Fuji) and 
		whether or not they were bruised.</p>
	<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
			<th>Bruised</th>
			</tr>
		<tr>
			<th align="left">Granny Smith</th>
			<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">40</td>
			<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">8</td>
			</tr>
		<tr>
			<th align="left">Fuji</th>
			<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">24</td>
			<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">24</td>
			</tr>
		</table></div>
	<p>We now consider choosing an apple randomly from the batch of 96 apples; it can be one of two types (Granny Smith or Fuji) and it can be bruised or not bruised (denoted below as B and B'). The tree diagram below describes the probabilities for the apple type and its bruising.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tree_apples.gif" width="600" height="397"></p>
<p>Note that</p>
<ul>
	<li>P(GS) = <sup>48</sup>/<sub>96</sub> = 0.5 since half of the apples are of Granny Smiths</li>
	<li>P(B&nbsp;|&nbsp;GS) = <sup>8</sup>/<sub>48</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> since 8 of the 48 Granny Smith apples are bruised</li>
	<li>P(GS and B) = 0.5 × <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> = 0.083</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not have to represent the apple type first.&nbsp; If we chose to represent the bruising characteristic first, the tree diagram would be as follows:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tree_apples2.gif" width="600" height="397"></p>
<p>The joint probabilities on the right are the same whichever ordering of the variables is used.</p>
<p class="heading">Sampling without replacement</p>
<p>In the apple-bruising example, there was little to be gained by using a tree diagram &mdash; the joint probabilities could have been obtained more easily directly from the original contingency table. </p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Tree diagrams are more useful for problems in which there is a natural ordering of the two measurements.</p>
</div></div>
<p>The next example concern selection of two students from a class of 2 women and 4 men to give a presentation on their weekend reading on the history of Probability. The fairest way to select two students from the class is by &quot;pulling names out of a hat&quot;. The following tree diagram illustrates this process.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tree_replacement.gif" width="518" height="435"></p>
<p>Note that the probability of the first student being male is P(M)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sub><sup>4</sup></sub>/<sub>6</sub> since four out of the six students are male. However the <strong>conditional</strong> probability of the second student being male <strong>given that the first is male</strong> is reduced to <sub><sup>3</sup></sub>/<sub>5</sub> since there are now only five remaining students of whom 3 are male.</p>
<p>This diagram allows us to determine the probability that one student of each gender is selected.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>P(one man and one woman) &nbsp; = &nbsp; P(MW) + P(WM)<br>
&nbsp; = &nbsp; <sup>8</sup>/<sub>30</sub> + <sup>8</sup>/<sub>30</sub> = <sup>8</sup>/<sub>15</sub></p>
</div></div>
