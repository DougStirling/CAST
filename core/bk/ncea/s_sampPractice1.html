<p>Although a simple random sample  is conceptually
the easiest sampling scheme, there are sometimes advantages to selecting
a sample in different ways.</p>
<p class="heading">Separate samples from different groups</p>
<p>In a <strong>stratified random sample</strong>, the individuals in the population
are split into different groups (called <strong>strata</strong>). A separate
simple random sample is selected from each stratum.</p>
<p>If the strata differ from each other, a stratified random sample is more accurate
than a simple random sample.</p>
<p class="heading">Cluster samples</p>
<p>It is often cheaper to sample <strong>groups</strong> of related individuals
called <strong>clusters</strong>. For example, houses are often sampled with
questions asked from all members of the selected households.</p>
<p>Although estimates will be less accurate than from a simple random sample
of the same number of individuals, the reduced cost may allow more individuals
to be sampled.</p>
<p class="heading">Systematic samples</p>
<p>A systematic sample is done when the individuals can be listed in order.
For example, when sampling items for defects in the output of a production line,
every 100th item may be inspected.</p>
<p>A systematic sample is easier to implement for the person collecting the data.</p>
