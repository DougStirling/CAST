<p class=heading>Displays show the distribution of values in the data</p>

<p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, dot plots and stem and 
leaf plots show clearly the variability in the data &mdash; the <strong>distribution 
of values</strong>. They highlight which ranges of values are most common 
in the data and which ranges are less common. Several alternative phrases 
are used to describe this aspect of the data. </p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>density</strong> of values in the data</li>
  <li>The <strong>distribution</strong> of the data</li>
  <li>The <strong>shape</strong> of the data's distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>Of particular interest are the <strong>centre</strong> of the distribution 
and the <strong>spread</strong> of values around this. We will examine the concepts 
of centre and spread in <a href="javascript:nav.gotoNamedPage('M_assessment','numerical')">Chapter 
3: Numerical Summaries</a>.</p>
	
<div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Example</p>
		<p>The stacked dot plot below shows the distribution of marks for 41 students 
			in a test that has been marked out of 50.</p>
		<div class="centred"><img src="images/skewDistn.gif" width="360" height="68"></div>
<p>There are no outliers or noteworthy clusters in the data.</p>
		
<p>However the display shows clearly the student-to-student variability in these 
measurements. If similar data were collected from other students, we would expect 
about three quarters to be able to get a mark of 30 or more, with perhaps one 
in ten being under 20 and hardly anyone scoring below 10. </p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Symmetry and skewness</p>
<p>If the density tails off in a similar way at both ends of the distribution, 
we call the distribution <strong>symmetric</strong>. If one side of the distribution 
tails off more slowly, we say that the distribution is <strong>skew</strong>.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
		<p>The centre of the distribution of the mark data above describes a 'typical' 
			mark &mdash; say around 35. Although no students have marks 15 higher than this, 
			a few have marks up to 30 lower than this 'centre'. The distribution is 
			therefore skew with a long tail towards the lower marks.</p>
		<p>The test therefore spreads out the weakest students, but does not distinguish 
			well between the best students.</p>
