	<p class="heading">Aim of scaling</p>
	<p>Sometimes it is felt that an exam or test is 'too easy' or 'too hard' and 
		that the marks therefore do not give a fair indication of how the students 
		have performed in relation to other classes or to a national expectation. 
		For example, if the internal assessment component of marks for a Bursary subject 
		are out of step with the marks achieved by the class in the external exam, 
		they will be scaled up or down.</p>
	<p class="heading">Linear transformations</p>
	<p>The simplest type of scaling is called a <strong>linear scaling</strong> 
		or a <strong>linear transformation</strong> of the marks. The simplest form 
		of scaling multiplies each mark by a constant.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/simpleLinear.gif" width="223" height="16"> </p>
	<p>If the constant <i>b</i> is less than 1.0, the marks are reduced by the scaling 
		whereas if <i>b</i> is greater than 1.0, the marks are increased.</p>
	<p>A problem with this type of scaling is that its greatest effect is on the 
		highest marks in the class and the lowest marks are affected least. A more 
		flexible type of linear transformation is given by the equation</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/linearMark.gif" width="250" height="14"> </p>

  <p>The effect of these types of transformation are most easily explained in 
		an example.</p>

			raw marks of 20 students in a class. The line represents a linear scaling

		<p>Initially the constant <i>a</i> in the transformation is zero &mdash; a mark 
			of 0 stays 0 after the transformation. Drag the red arrow on the right to 
			change the constant <i>b</i> &mdash; the dot plot on the left of the diagram 
			shows how the scaled marks are changed.</p>
		<p>Click on individual crosses to see how their values are affected by the 
			transformation.</p>
		<p>Click on the checkbox <strong>Zero unchanged</strong> under the diagram 
			to turn it off &mdash; this allows you to change both parameters. Drag the two 
			red arrows to adjust the scaling of the marks.</p>

</div>

  <p class="heading">Centre and spread</p>
	
<p>The centre and spread of the scaled marks can be easily found from those of 
the original marks. After a transformation of the form:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/linearMark.gif" width="250" height="14"> </p>
	
<p>the mean (and other measures of centre such as the median) are similarly related:</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><strong>new mean</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>a</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em> &nbsp;&times &nbsp;<strong>old mean</strong></span> 
	</p>
	
<p>The standard deviation (and other measures of spread that are expressed in 
the same units as the raw data, such as the inter-quartile range) are related 
with the equation:</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><strong>new sd</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp;<em><font size="+1">|</font>b<font size="+1">|</font></em> &nbsp;&times &nbsp;<strong>old sd</strong></span> 
	</p>
	<p>You will never want to use a negative scale factor, <i>b</i>, for scaling 
		marks. However note that if the scale factor, <i>b</i>, is negative, we must 
		change its sign since the standard deviation must be positive.</p>
