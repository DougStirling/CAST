	<p class="heading">Simple summaries of spread</p>
		
	<p>The simplest summary statistics that describe the variability in a data set 
		are based on the quartiles and extremes of the distribution.</p>

<dl>
		<dt>Range</dt>
		<dd>The <strong>range</strong> is the difference between the maximum and minimum 
			values. All the data are within an interval of this width.</dd>
		<dt>Interquartile range</dt>
		<dd>The <strong>interquartile range</strong> is the difference between the 
			upper quartile and lower quartile. Half of the data lie between the two 
			quartiles, so an interval of this width includes half the data.</dd>
	</dl>
		
	<p>The range of a data set only depends on the minimum and maximum values and 
		is therefore a fairly poor summary of spread. In a large set of marks, it 
		is not uncommon for one student to obtain full marks and another to get zero, 
		so the range does not describe the spread in marks for more typical students.</p>
	<p>The interquartile range is therefore a better summary of the spread of marks.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram below shows marks in a test that was attempted by three classes</p>

<p>It is evident from the jittered dot plots that:</p>

<ul>
  		
<li>Room 1 tends to have higher marks than rooms 2 or 3.</li>
  		
<li>Room 3 is more variable than the other two classes.</li>
</ul>

<table width="75%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
<tr> 
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><strong>The table of medians and ranges concisely summarises 
these differences between the classes.</strong></td>

<p>(The medians are also displayed as blue lines on the dot plots and the ranges 
are represented by the widths of the gray bands behind the dot plots.) </p>

		
<p>Click the button <strong> Sample</strong> a few times to give the three classes 
different tests. In most (but not all) of these different data sets, you will 
observe the same differences between the classes. </p>

	<p class=heading>Interpreting the median and interquartile range</p>

<p>Although a single measure of centre and one of spread provide only limited
information about the shape of a distribution of values, it is
possible to sketch a bell-shaped histogram that matches the values. Such
a 'guess' is often close to the actual distribution of values.</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/centerSpread/images/iqrAndHisto.gif" width="424" height="223">
</p>

<p>The two values do not provide any information about skewness of
the distribution or other features of its shape, so such a 'guess' may not be
accurate.</p>

<p class=heading>In Excel</p>
  <p>There are no built-in functions to evaluate the range or interquartile range 
		in Excel, but they can be easily found from the minimum, maximum and quartiles 
		of the distribution. If the marks are contained in the cells A1 to A25 of 
		a spreadsheet, the formula &quot;=QUARTILE(A1:A25, 3)-QUARTILE(A1:A25, 1)&quot; 
		will calculate the interquartile range and &quot;=MAX(A1:A25)-MIN(A1:A25)&quot; 
		will find the range.</p>
