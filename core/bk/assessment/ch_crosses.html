<p>Even a simple technique such as sorting a set of class marks into order can 
highlight features that are not evident in a table of the raw data. However, information 
can be extracted more easily if the marks are displayed <strong>graphically</strong>.</p>
	<p>We start by examining a simpler data structure &mdash; a single set of marks from 
		one class in isolation. Data of this form are called a <strong>batch</strong> 
		of numbers, or a <strong>univariate numerical data set</strong>.</p>
	<p>This chapter describes some simple ways to display the variability in a batch 
		of marks, and gives some examples of the types of information that may be 
		learned from these displays.</p>
