<p>To show the distribution of values in small data sets, graphical displays 
		that separately represent each value are usually best. For example, dot plots 
		and stem-and-leaf plots of marks from a single class identify the marks of 
		individual students as well as showing the overall distribution.</p>
	
<p>However, for large data sets, we are usually less interested in individual 
marks than in getting a picture of the overall distribution. Indeed, separately 
representing thousands of individual values in a graphical display can make it 
harder to assess the shape of the distribution &mdash; there is too much 'noise' in 
the display that makes the 'signal' less prominent.</p>
	<p>In this chapter, we consider graphical displays that <strong>summarise</strong> 
		data. Some information is lost (individual values), but the important distributional 
		information is shown more clearly.</p>
