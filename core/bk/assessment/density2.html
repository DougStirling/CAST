	<p class="heading">Flexibility in bin widths and bin starting positions</p>
	<p>There is much more freedom in the choice of histogram bins than in the corresponding 
		bins for stem and leaf plots. Indeed, <strong>any</strong> values can be used 
		for the bin boundaries in a histogram.</p>
	
<p>We initially restrict attention to histograms where <strong>all bins are of 
the same width</strong>, but even then:</p>
		
<ul>
		<li>The bin width can be any value.</li>
		<li>The bins can start at any value, not just multiples of the bin width.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class=heading>Bins should be chosen for smoothness</p>
	<p>As in stem and leaf plots, we aim for smoothness in the outline of the histogram 
		rectangles. The histogram below of the ages when students reached reading 
		age 8 is reasonably smooth &mdash; we informally interpret the histogram in the 
		same way as the smooth blue curve that has been superimposed 'by eye' on it.</p>
	<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="images/ageHistoCanopy.gif" width="289" height="193"> 
	</div>
	<p>Histogram bins should therefore be chosen to make the outline of the histogram 
		as smooth as possible. Adjusting bin width is most important in attaining 
		this goal.</p>
	<ul>
		
<li>When the bins are too narrow, the outline becomes jagged.</li>
		
<li>When the bins are wide, the outline becomes blocky.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>There is no substitution for trial-and-error in this process!</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p>The histogram below shows the distribution of 200 values. </p>

<p>Use the buttons below the histogram to investigate the effect of narrowing 
and widening the histogram bins. Which histogram is smoothest (and therefore 
best)? </p>
<ul>
			
<li>When bin width is less than 4.0, the histogram starts to look jagged.</li>
			<li>When bin width is greater than 8.0, the histogram becomes blocky and 
				shape information between 0 and 10 is lost by the grouping.</li>
		</ul>
		
<p>The general principle is to <strong>use the smallest bin width that is not 
jagged.</strong> This is a subjective judgment and any bin width between 4.0 and 
8.0 would be acceptable, though a bin width at the lower end of this range is 
better. </p>
	</div>
	<p class="heading">Warning about histograms of small data sets</p>
	<p>Adjusting the bin width and the starting position for the first bin can give 
		a <strong>surprising amount of variability in histogram shape</strong> for 
		small data sets. As a result, you must be wary of over-interpreting features 
		such as clusters or skewness in such histograms.</p>

<p>The histogram below shows the 25 maths test marks that we examined earlier.</p>

</div>
		
		<p>Use the buttons under the histogram to adjust the bin width and to shift 
			the histogram bins to the left or right. Note that the appearance of splitting 
			into clusters is only apparent in some of the histograms, but not in others.</p>
		<p><strong>Are the clusters real, or are they just an artifact of our choice 
			of bins?</strong> Without further supporting evidence, the clusters are 
			not pronounced enough for us to conclude that the students must form into 
			two meaningful groups. However they do give an indication of clustering 
			that a good 'data detective' would investigate further.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p><strong>Dot plots should be used in preference to histograms for small data 
		sets.</strong> They show the size of the data set more clearly and hence give 
		some warning about the risk of over-interpretation. </p>
	<p class=heading>Histograms of larger data sets are more representative</p>
	<p>For large data sets, changes to the bins have less effect on the histogram 
		shape &mdash; we would sketch a similar smooth 'canopy' over most resulting histograms. 
		Since they provide a much less cluttered display of the data than dot plots 
		or stem and leaf plots, <strong>histograms are good summaries of the distribution 
		of values in a large data set</strong>.</p>
	<p>Finally, the shape of the histogram is less variable when different data 
		sets are measured from the same underlying process.</p>

<p>Click the button <strong>Sample</strong> under the histogram to observe the 
distribution of another 300 marks recorded from similar students. Repeat several 
times and observe that although details of the distribution's shape vary, the 
following features are visible in most sample histograms:</p>
			
		<ul>
			
<li>The distribution is fairly smooth and unimodal (with a single peak).</li>
			
<li>The distribution is centred round 40.</li>
			
<li>There are occasional values almost as low as 0 and as high as 100.</li>
			
<li>The distribution is skew with a longer 'tail' of higher values.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Use the buttons under the histogram to adjust the bin width and shift the 
			bins left or right, and observe that the above features persist. </p>
