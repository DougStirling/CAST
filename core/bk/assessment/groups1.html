<p class="heading">Five-number summary</p>

  <p>The distribution of values in many data sets can be effectively summarised 
		by a few numerical values called <strong>summary statistics</strong>. In this 
		section we describe a graphical display that is based on five summary statistics 
		called the <strong>5-number summary</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The two <strong>extremes</strong> of the batch (i.e. the minimum and maximum values).</li>
    <li>Three other values that split the batch into groups with (as closely as 
			possible) equal numbers of values (the <strong>lower quartile</strong>, 
			the <strong>median</strong> and the <strong>upper quartile</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Box plot</p>

<p>The <strong>box plot</strong> of a batch of values displays these five values 
	graphically. </p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/boxPlot/images/boxPlotValues.gif" width="362" height="427"> 
</p>

<p>A box plot therefore splits the data set into four quarters with (approximately) equal numbers
of values.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram below shows a batch of values as a jittered dot plot and a box plot.

<p><strong>Click</strong> on the different parts of the box plot to display the proportion of
values in the batch in the different intervals, and to verify that the box plot does indeed split
the batch into quarters.

  <p class="heading">Details</p>
	<p>We have skipped over some details in our description of the median and quantiles. 
		You should usually rely on a computer to evaluate the median and quartiles, 
		so a precise definition is not strictly necessary. The idea of splitting the 
		data into 4 equal-sized groups allows you to interpret the shape of box plots.</p>
	<p><font color="#999999">(For further details, see the General Version of CAST 
		for Students.)</font></p>
	
<p class="heading">Box plots and histograms</p>
	<p>It is instructive to consider how the median and quartiles relate to a histogram 
		of a data set.</p>
	<p class="eqn"> <img class="gif" src="../../en/boxPlot/images/histoQuantiles.gif" width="542" height="420"> 
	</p>
	<p>The data set is split into quarters by the median and quartiles, so each 
		section of the box plot contains equal numbers of data values and therefore 
		has relative frequency 1/4. Since histogram area is proportional to relative 
		frequency, the median and quartiles <strong>split the histogram into four 
		equal areas</strong>.</p>
	<p>Although this result does not hold exactly if the median and quartiles do 
		not coincide with class boundaries, the median and quartiles always approximately 
		split a histogram into equal areas.</p>
		
	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p>The diagram below shows the box plot of a symmetric distribution under 
			the corresponding histogram.</p>
			
		<div class="centred"> 
			<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="450" height="350">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="boxPlotProg.DragBoxHistoApplet">
			<param name="horizAxis" value="0 12 0 2">
			</applet> 
		</div>
		
		<p>Use the pop-up menu to change the shape of the underlying distribution. 
			Observe that the histogram is split into four equal areas, corresponding 
			to the median and quartiles of the distribution, and therefore the sections 
			of the box plot.</p>
		<p>Change the extremes, median and quartiles by dragging them on the diagram. 
			Observe how the histogram shape reflects their values &mdash; when any two are 
			close together, the density must be high (since the corresponding histogram 
			area is always a quarter of the total area.</p>
	</div>
	
  <p class=heading>What does a box plot tell you about the distribution?</p>
	
<dl> 
	<dt>Centre</dt>
	<dd>The vertical line inside the box (the median) gives an indication of the 
		centre of the distribution.</dd>
		
	<dt>Spread</dt>
	<dd>The width of the box (the interquartile range) gives an indication of the 
		spread of values in the distribution.</dd>
		
	<dt>Shape</dt>
	<dd><strong>High density corresponds to adjacent box plot values being close 
			together</strong>. In particular, if the extreme and quartile on one side 
			are closer to the median than the extreme and quartile on the other side, 
			this shows that the distribution is <strong>skew</strong>.</dd>

<div class="diagram"> 
		<p>The diagram below shows the jittered dot plot and box plot of a batch of 
			100 values.</p>
			
		<div class="centred"> 
			<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="500" height="200">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>

		<ul>
			<li>Use the <strong>Centre</strong> slider to observe how the box plot shows 
				the 'centre' of the distribution of values. <br>
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Use the <strong>Spread</strong> slider to observe how the box plot shows 
				the spread of values in the data. <br>
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Return the <strong>Spread</strong> slider to its maximum, then investigate 
				the effect of the <strong>Skewness</strong> slider. For example, a high 
				density to the left of the distribution and a long tail to the right results 
				in the lower extreme and quartile being close to the median. <br>
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>With the <strong>Spread</strong> slider at its maximum and the <strong>Skewness</strong> 
				slider in the middle, investigate the effect of the <strong>Tails</strong> 
				slider. Moving this slider to the right concentrates values in the centre 
				of the distribution, so the tails of the box plot become relatively longer.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p>From any box plot, you should now have a reasonable impression of the distribution
	of values, and should be able to sketch the corresponding histogram.</p>
