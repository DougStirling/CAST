<p>This introduction provides background information about Assessment CAST, and 
also about CAST in general. The module was developed to help teachers get useful 
information from mark data that have been collected from their classes.</p>
	
<p>The introduction also provides an introductory discussion of the notion of 
variability and gives an example where a set of marks holds information that is 
not immediately obvious until the data are examined with a simple statistical 
method.</p>
