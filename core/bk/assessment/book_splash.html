<p>Assessment CAST is one module of a resource that was developed at Massey University 
to teach introductory statistics, called Computer-Assisted Statistics Teaching 
(CAST). This module can be used as professional development to help teachers get 
useful information from classroom assessment data. The module addresses the following 
questions, among others.</p>

<p class="heading">Mark data</p>
	
<p>Teachers collect a wide range of numerical information from their classes, 
mostly from marked assignments and tests. Some forms of assessment are locally 
authored and marked, whereas others are written externally and may be moderated 
against national standards.</p>
<p>Class sets of marks are used for many purposes.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A single set of marks can highlight individuals who are performing unusually 
			well or poorly.</li>
		<li>From a single set of marks, it may be possible to detect differences between 
			groups in the class (e.g. girls and boys).</li>
		<li> If standard tests are used, comparisons can be made between age groups, 
			between different teachers or between a class and the national distribution 
			of marks.</li>
		<li> If successive tests are given to the same students, it is possible to 
			detect students whose improvement is unusually fast or slow.</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>To get this kind of information from data, the marks must be looked at in the 
right way.</p>
	
<p>Obtaining information from data is the domain of <strong>statistics</strong>, 
so this module, Assessment CAST, first covers basic graphical and numerical statistical 
methods in the context of a set of marks. Later sections of Assessment CAST deal 
with statistical methods that are particularly appropriate for mark data.</p>
