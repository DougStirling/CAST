<p class="heading">Availability and copyright</p>
  <p>The standard version of CAST is currently available for use in education 
		free of charge, though we reserve the right to make a modest charge for registration 
		at some later stage. However it is not freeware and full copyright is retained 
		by the author, W. Douglas Stirling.</p>
	
  <p class="heading">CAST must not be modified</p>
  <p>CAST contains a collection of Java applets (small programs) embedded in a 
		series of html pages that also contain textual material. </p>

  
<p>The complete CAST package must not be modified, even if it is downloaded to 
a local hard disk, file server, or web server. No parts of CAST may be used outside 
the CAST package without the author's prior permission. </p>
