<p class="heading">Summarising centre and spread</p>

  <p>Most data sets exhibit variability &mdash; all values are not the same! Two important 
		aspects of the distribution of values are particularly important.</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Centre</dt>
		
<dd>The centre of a distribution is a 'typical' value around which the data are 
located.</dd>
		<dt>Spread</dt>
		
<dd>The spread of a distribution of values describes how the distance of the individual 
values from the centre.</dd>
	</dl>

<p>In this chapter, <a href="javascript:nav.gotoNamedPage('M_assessment','numerical')">Numerical 
summaries of marks</a>, we examine how to describe centre and spread with numerical 
values called <strong>summary statistics</strong>. Numerical summaries of centre 
and spread give particularly concise and meaningful comparisons of different groups 
of marks.</p>
		
	<div class="diagram">

		
<p>Three year 4 classes are taught the same topic with different teaching methods. 
There is considerable variation in the marks achieved in the three classes.</p>
		<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
			<tr>
				<td align="center"><img src="images/differentMarkCentres.gif" width="243" height="343"></td>
				<td align="left"> 
				<p>Observe that:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>The centre of Class A's distribution is nearly 60.</li>
					  <li>The students in Class B have performed poorly. The centre of their 
							distribution is about 30 and none have passed.</li>
					  <li>Class C has the best marks. The centre of the distribution is 
							close to 80 and all students have passed.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>A numerical measure of centre should describe this tendency for some 
			classes to get better marks (on average) than others.</p>
		
		<hr width="75%">

		
<p>Different teaching methods were used for three other classes. In Class E, all 
students were given the same amount of help whereas in Classes D and F, a third 
of the students were given extra help. In Class D, the top students were given 
extra tuition whereas in Class F it was the weakest students to whom help was 
targeted.</p>
		<p>There is no tendency for any of these classes to achieve better marks than 
			the others &mdash; the centres of all three distributions are close to 50.</p>

				<p>However </p>
					
<ul>
<li>Class D is most variable. By giving extra help to the best students, their 
marks did improve, but the weakest students performed very poorly</li>
<li>In Class F, all students are reaching about the same level.</li>
</ul>
					</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>A numerical measure of spread should describe how consistent the marks 
			are in a class.</p>
