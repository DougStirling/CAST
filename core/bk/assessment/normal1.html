  <p class="heading">Smooth curve to approximate a histogram</p>

  
<p>We have suggested that smoothness is a goal when drawing histograms, and especially 
those of large data sets. In this section, we explicitly try to obtain a smooth 
curve that approximates the shape of a histogram. Such a curve is called a <strong>probability 
density function</strong>.</p>
	<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="images/ageHistoCanopy.gif" width="289" height="193">	</div>
<p>Drawing a smooth curve by hand can be criticised for its lack of subjectivity 
		-- two people might draw quite different curves. As a result, we prefer to 
		use a more objective curve-fitting method based on a mathematical function. 
		The challenge is to find a smooth curve that matches the data's histogram 
		closely.</p>
	<p class="heading">Why bother?</p>
	<p>Sometimes we collect marks in order to gain a better understanding of that 
		particular class of students. However we may also be interested in using the 
		distribution of marks from one year in order to <strong>predict</strong> the 
		likely marks from the same assessment activity for <strong>a different group 
		of similar students</strong> &mdash; for example, the following year's class.</p>
	<p>For a small data set, such as a single class set of 30 or fewer marks, there 
		is a considerable degree of 'randomness' in the data and therefore in the 
		shape of the resulting histogram. As a result, direct use of one year's histogram 
		to predict the distribution of marks in the following year may be poor &mdash; 
		the 'random' bumps in the shape are unlikely to be repeated in the same way.</p>
	<p>A curve that smooths out irregularities in the histogram is likely to give 
		a better guide to the expected distribution the next year.</p>

<p>Click <strong> Sample</strong> a few times to see different histograms that 
might be observed from other classes of 30 similar students. In a data set of 
only 30 values, there is considerable 'randomness' in the shape of the histogram, 
so we really have very little idea of even whether to use a symmetric distribution 
to predict the following year's mark distribution based on a single sample.</p>
		<p>As a result, a very simple smooth curve will give as good a prediction 
			of the next year's distribution as other more complicated types of curve.</p>
