<p class="heading">In small data sets, features of displays may not be meaningful</p>

<p>Be careful <strong>not to overinterpret</strong> patterns in small data sets. 
Clusters, outliers, or skewness may apprear by chance even if there is no meaningful 
basis to these features. </p>
<p>For example, without outside supporting evidence, you should not conclude that 
a gap such as that in the maths test marks dataset <strong>must</strong> correspond 
to a meaningful grouping of the students into two clusters. </p>

values, so this warning is particularly important.</strong></td>

<p class="heading">Random marks</p>
<p>To investigate this further, we will randomly generate 25 marks (each out of 
100) from students in which there are <strong>no separate sub-groups or clusters</strong>.

					<p>The stem and leaf plot on the left describes the 25 marks that have 
been obtained. Click the button <strong>New Sample</strong> several times to examine 
other sets of marks. By chance, there are occasionally gaps in the distribution

<p>Because of how the values have been obtained, we know that these features in 
the samples are only random artifacts &mdash; they do not reflect real clusters or 
outliers in the underlying process. </p>
