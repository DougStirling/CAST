  <p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data 
		are called <strong>outliers</strong>. In the context of assessment, these 
		correspond to students whose marks are unusually higher or lower than the 
		rest of the marks.</p>

  
<p>Detection of outliers is particularly important. In a set of class marks, the 
outlier may have been incorrectly recorded. Or there may have been other anomalous 
circumstances associated with it &mdash; for example, the student may have been late 
or ill. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything atypical can 
be found, it is probably worth deleting the outlier from the data set and mentioning 
it separately in a report on the data. </p>

<td valign="top"> <p>The stem and leaf plot on the right shows a set of class 
marks (out of 100).</p>
<p>The display shows one outlier &mdash; a student who only had a mark of 6 out of 
100. Was this a mistake? Perhaps the mark should have been 60? What else might 
have explained this poor mark?</p>
