  <p class="heading">Data: A single set of class marks</p>
	
<p>In this release of Assessment CAST, we will look at a single set of class marks 
in isolation.</p>
<p>Interesting information can also be obtained from comparisons of different 
sets of marks (different classes or different years) or by looking at a series 
of assessments from the same students. However graphical and numerical methods 
for these data structures are more complicated, so it is best to start with the 
simplest scenario &mdash; a single set of marks.</p>
	<p class="heading">Causes of variability</p>
	<p>An important characteristic of marks is <strong>variability</strong>. Variability 
		arises from several sources.</p>
	
	<ul>
		
<li><b>Variability between classes.</b> This could be caused by differences between 
teachers or differences between the backgrounds of the students (especially if 
the classes are from different areas of the town with different socio-economic 
characteristics).</li>
		<li><strong>Variability between students.</strong> Some students are more 
			intelligent than others or have simply understood the material that is being 
			tested better. This is usually the major cause of variability of marks within 
			a class.</li>
		<li><strong>Test-to-test variability.</strong> Even if given two equivalent 
			tests, students will not usually perform identically. This may be caused 
			by guessing some answers or other chance features of the test that the student 
			knows or does not know.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It is important to recognise these three causes of variability.</p>
	<p class="heading">Variability between classes</p>
	<p>This would be of most interest to a principal, head of department or board 
		of trustees. Does one teacher's class perform worse than the classes of others?</p>
	<p class="heading">Variability between students</p>
	<p>This is of most interest to a teacher. This component of variability tells 
		which students are performing best.</p>
	<p class="heading">Test-to-test variability</p>
	<p>This aspect of variability is just a nuisance since it tells you nothing 
		about how well a student understands the material. The better designed the 
		test, the lower the randomness in the results that are obtained. In general, 
		short tests tend to have more variable results &mdash; longer tests tend to give 
		a more consistent measure of ability.</p>
	<p class="heading">Distinguishing causes of variability</p>
	
<p>Unfortunately it is <strong>impossible to distinguish</strong> these three 
sources of variability from a single set of class marks. If sets of marks are 
available from different classes, or we have different assessments from the same 
class, it is possible to get some handle on the different sources of variability. 
However, from a single set of marks, we must simply be aware of the issue when 
interpreting the data.</p>
