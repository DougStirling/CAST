<p class="heading">The full version of CAST</p>
<p>CAST stands for <i>Computer-Assisted Statistics Teaching</i>. It was initially 
developed as a complete course in introductory statistics at Massey University. 
The <a href="http://cast.massey.ac.nz">full version of CAST</a> can be used without 
charge at present. Instructions for downloading can be found by clicking the <strong>New 
User</strong> link on the <a href="http://cast.massey.ac.nz">CAST web site</a> 
if you have a slow internet connection.</p>
<p>The full version of CAST contains three full statistics courses that are aimed 
at students from different subject areas. The <i>General Version for Students</i> 
contains data sets and scenarios of general interest, the <i>Biometric Version 
for Students</i> contains data sets and scenarios from biological, health and 
agricultural sciences, and the <i>Business Version for Students</i> contains data 
sets and scenarios from business and commerce.</p>
	<p class="heading">CAST modules</p>
	
<p>The Assessment CAST module is one of several additional modules that are either 
aimed at different groups of users or cover more advanced statistical techniques. 
They can all be accessed from the full version of CAST.</p>
<p class="heading">What is special about CAST?</p>
	
	<p>CAST takes a different approach from paper-based textbooks.</p>
	
<ul>
		<li><strong>CAST is highly interactive.</strong> <font color=black>Interaction 
			with diagrams on most pages retains student attention and enhances learning.</font></li>
		<li><strong>Dynamic graphics explain difficult concepts.</strong> <font color=black>Animations, 
			simulations and other dynamic displays are extensively used.</font></li>
		<li><strong>Advanced topics are included.</strong> <font color=black>With 
			a computer-based approach, students can be taught topics that were once 
			considered 'advanced'.</font></li>
		<li><strong>The approach is data-focused.</strong> <font color=black>Students 
			are exposed to many data sets.</font></li>
	</ul>
