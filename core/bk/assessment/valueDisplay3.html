<td valign="top"> <p>The aim in a stem and leaf plot is for the 'canopy' of the 
leaves &mdash; the shape formed by the ends of the stacks of leaves &mdash; to be a fairly 
smooth curve. A little irregularity is inevitable, but the leaves should not have 
too jagged an outline.</p>
<p>The diagram on the right shows this for the Maths mark data.</p></td>

<p>The stem and leaf plot shows the distribution of marks well, but also allows 
any student to determine exactly his/her place in the class. For example, a student 
who got 57/60 can easily count that 7 students got a higher mark in the class.</p>
</div>
<p>In most situations however, stem and leaf plots have few advantages over stacked 
dot plots as graphical displays of data.</p>
