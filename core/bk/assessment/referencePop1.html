  <p class="heading">Standard tests</p>

  
<p>In the previous section, <a href="javascript:nav.gotoNamedPage('SmoreNormal','moreNormal')">Z-scores 
and stanines</a>, we looked at a single set of class marks in isolation. In the 
current section, we ask how these marks compare to a larger population &mdash; for 
example, the rest of the country.</p>
		
	<p>In New Zealand, various standard tests have been written and are available 
		for any school to use. These serve several purposes:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>They are well-written and effectively assess student ability.</li>
		<li>They allow student performance to be compared to a national distribution 
			of marks. Guidelines for interpretation of marks are often provided.</li>
		<li>The results from these tests provide educational researchers with information 
			about how student ability is changing from year to year.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>We concentrate on the second of these points. The national distribution of 
		marks for a standard test provides a guideline for interpreting an individual 
		student or class.</p>

<p class="heading">School Entry Assessment</p>

		<p>One standard assessment package is the <strong>School Entry Assessment</strong> 
			kit which is used by many new entrant teachers in New Zealand. Student summary 
			sheets are returned to the Ministry of Education and the diagram below shows 
			the national distribution of marks for one part of the assessment ('Checkout') 
			from about 30,000 students between 1997 and 2000.</p>

		<p>The numbers of students getting each mark are shown on the axis on the 
			left. The axis on the right shows the proportions and is of more interest. 
			<strong>Drag</strong> over the bar chart to read off the proportion of students 
			with marks less than any value &mdash; the sum of the bar heights to the left 
			of the value.</p>

  <p class="heading">No need to smooth</p>

  <p>For a small set of class marks, a normal distribution may be an adequate 
		description of the distribution since there is not enough data to accurately 
		assess the shape of the distribution.</p>
	
<p>However, when there are many thousands of marks, a simple distribution such 
as a normal distribution is unlikely to be adequate. Since a bar chart or histogram 
of the data should be reasonably smooth, there is usually no need for further 
smoothing. </p>
	<p class="heading">Warning</p>
	<p>The students whose marks are compiled to form a 'national distribution' may 
		not form a typical cross-section of the country. If only high-decile schools 
		conduct a particular test, the 'national distribution' of marks will be centred 
		on a higher mark than would be typical from the country as a whole.</p>
	<p>For example, many of the better students in New Zealand sit the exam for 
		the Australian Mathematics Competition. Since this is a fairly selective group 
		of students, an 'average mark' in this exam should not be taken as an indication 
		that the student is only an 'average student'.</p>
	<p>National distributions should therefore be interpreted with caution unless 
		they represent a genuine cross-section of students.</p>
