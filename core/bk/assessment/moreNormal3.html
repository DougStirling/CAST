  <p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule for normal distributions</p>

  <p>Any probability (proportion or area) relating to a normal distribution can 
		be translated into a probability (area) for a standardised normal distribution. 
		Standardisation translates an X-value into a Z-value that expresses it as 
		a <strong>number of standard deviations from its mean</strong>. </p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/standardiseEqn2.gif" width="103" height="31">
</p>

<p>This equation can also be written in the form: </p>

<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>x</em> &nbsp;=&nbsp; &mu; &nbsp;+&nbsp; <em>z</em> &times; &sigma;</span>
</p>

<p>An important consequence is that the probability of getting a value within 
<i>k</i> standard deviations of the mean is the same for all normal populations. 
In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P(value within 1 standard deviation of the mean) is approx 0.68</li>
  <li>P(value within 2 standard deviations of the mean) is approx 0.95</li>
  <li>P(value within 3 standard deviations of the mean) is approx 0.997</li>
</ul>

	<p>It is especially worth remembering that approximately 95% of values in a 
		normal population are within 2 standard deviations of the distribution's mean. 
		<font color="#666666">To be more precise, exactly 95% of values in a normal 
		population are within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.</font> </p>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> over the normal probability density to read off the probabilities

<p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb for data sets</p>

  <p>The 70-95-100 rule was written for normal distributions. However it also 
		holds approximately for many real data sets.</p>
	<ul>
  <li>Approximately 70% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
  <li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
  <li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
</ul>

  <p>The 70-95-100 rule holds approximately for most reasonably symmetric data 
		sets. However for skew data, or data sets with long tails, outliers or clusters 
		the rule is likely to be less accurate.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>In the diagram below, the blue line is centred on the mean and its length is
one standard deviation. In other words, the line is mean ± 0.5 standard deviations.
</p>

<p>Click the button <strong>Sample</strong> a few times to generate some similar data sets.
</p>

<p>Now use the lower pop-up menu to display the mean ± <strong>one</strong> standard deviation.
Take a few more samples and observe that approximately 70% of the values are within
these limits.
</p>

<p>Repeat with displays of the mean ± <strong>two</strong> and <strong>three</strong>
standard deviations, verifing that approximately 95% and 100% of data values are
within the limits.
</p>

		<p>Use the pop-up menu on the right of the display to repeat the exercise 
			with batches of skew data. Observe that the 70-95-100 rule is less accurate 
			when the data do not have a reasonably symmetric distribution.</p>

  <p class=heading>Guessing the standard deviation from a histogram</p>

  <p>People usually find the standard deviation a difficult concept. Luckily, 
		understanding its definition is much less important than knowing its properties 
		and having a feel for what its numerical value means. </p>

  <p>If you have understood the 70-95-100 rule, you should be able to make a fairly 
		accurate guess at the standard deviation of a batch of values from a histogram 
		or dot plot (without doing any calculations). About 95% of the values should 
		be within 2 standard deviations of the mean, so after dropping the top 2.5% 
		and bottom 2.5% of the crosses (or area of the histogram), the remainder should 
		span approximately 4 standard deviations. So dividing this range by 4 should 
		approximate the standard deviation.</p>

	<p class=heading>Sketching a histogram from a mean and standard deviation</p>
	<p>Similarly, given the mean and standard deviation for a data set, you should 
		be able to draw a rough sketch of a symmetric histogram with that mean and 
		standard deviation. (It would be centred on the mean and 95% of the area would 
		be within 2 standard deviations of this.)</p>
