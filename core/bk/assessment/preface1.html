<p class="heading">Professional development resource for teachers</p>

  
<p>CAST stands for <em>Computer-Assisted Statistics Teaching</em>. It was initially 
developed as a complete course in introductory statistics.</p>
<p>This module, <em>Assessment CAST</em>, was developed to help teachers get useful 
information from mark data that they have collected from their classes. It explains 
some assessment-specific techniques that are not usually covered in an introductory 
statistics course.</p>
<p>Development of the module was partly sponsored by the New Zealand Ministry 
		of Education as a professional development resource for New Zealand teachers.

<p>The first three chapters, <a href="javascript:nav.gotoNamedPage('M_assessment','crosses')">Looking 
at Marks</a>, <a href="javascript:nav.gotoNamedPage('M_assessment','graphical')">Graphical 
Summaries</a>, and <a href="javascript:nav.gotoNamedPage('M_assessment','numerical')">Numerical 
Summaries</a>, describe simple graphical and numerical summaries of the performance 
of a class in a single test. These highlight the centre and spread of the distribution 
of marks in the class and also highlight any unusual marks and clusters of students 
who perform similarly.</p>
	<p>These core techniques are important to properly interpret information provided 
		by other teachers or administrations, since marks are often presented in the 
		form of means, standard deviations and histograms.</p>
	
<p>The fourth chapter, <a href="javascript:nav.gotoNamedPage('M_assessment','scaling')">Marks 
on Other Scales</a>, describes some methods of manipulating marks to change them 
into a form that is easier to compare with other classes or to compare with national 
performance. This chapter also includes a method for scaling marks up or down.</p>
	<!-- p>The fifth chapter describes some statistical methods that are useful for 
		comparing two different classes, or for comparing the performance of a class 
		in two different assessments. This section provides a simple introduction 
		to the ideas of confidence intervals.</p  -->
