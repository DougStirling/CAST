<div class="main">

  <p class="heading">Describing other locations in a distribution</p>

  <p>The mean and median both describe the 'centre' of a distribution. This is 
		usually what you want to summarise about a set of marks, but occasionally 
		a different part of the distribution is of more interest.</p>
	<p>For example, you might want to describe a typical mark for a 'good' or 'weak' 
		student.</p>
	<p class="heading">Quartiles</p>
	<p>The median of a distribution splits the data into two equally-sized groups. 
		In the same way, the <strong>quartiles</strong> are the three values that 
		split a data set into <strong>four</strong> equal parts. Note that the 'middle' 
		quartile is the median.</p>
	<p>The upper quartile describes a 'typical' mark for the top half of a class 
		and the lower quartile is a 'typical' mark for the bottom half of the class.</p>

	<p>The quartiles are closely related to the histogram of a data set. Since area 
		equals the proportion of values in a histogram, the quartiles split the histogram 
		into four approximately equal areas.</p>
	<p><font color="#666666">(The relationship is only approximate if the quartiles 
		do not coincide with histogram bin boundaries.)</font></p>

	</p>
	<p class="heading">Deciles</p>
	<p>In a similar way, the <strong>deciles</strong> of a distribution are the 
		<strong>nine</strong> values that split the data set into <strong>ten</strong> 
		equal parts.</p>
	<p>You should not try to calculate deciles from small data sets &mdash; a single 
		class of marks is too small to get useful values since the extreme deciles 
		are very variable. However the deciles can be useful descriptions for larger 
		data sets such as national distributions for marks from standard tests.</p>

		<p>Click on the areas between the quartiles and verify that the quartiles 
			split the students into four groups of 15.</p>
		<p>Use the pop-up menu to display deciles for the data, and verify that the 
			9 deciles split the students into 10 groups, each containing 6 students.</p>

</div>

	<p class="heading">Deciles for the distribution and for individual students</p>
	<p>The term 'decile' is used in two different contexts. It is confusing that 
		the same word is used in both ways, so be careful!</p>
	<p>When applied to a distribution (a large group of marks), there are <strong>nine</strong> 
		deciles, each of which is a <strong>mark</strong>.</p>
	
<p>A student whose mark is below the first decile is said to be <strong>in decile 
1</strong>. Similarly, a student whose marks is between the first and second deciles 
is<strong> in decile 2</strong>, ... and a student whose marks is above the ninth 
decile is <strong>in decile 10</strong>. When applied to individual students, 
the term 'decile' is therefore a <strong>number between 1 and 10</strong>. </p>
		
	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p>For example, the histogram below shows the distribution of marks in a test 
			(out of 60) that was attempted by 600 students. Each student's mark is represented 
			by a square in the histogram.</p>

	  <p class=eqn><img src="images/histoDeciles.gif" width="371" height="253"> 
		</p>

	  <p>The nine deciles split the students into 10 groups of 60.</p>
		<p>The first decile is 17.5 so the weakest tenth of the students in the class 
			had a mark below this. This decile therefore summarises the performance 
			of the weakest students.</p>
		<p>Students with marks below 17.5 are said to be in decile 1. Those with marks 
			between 17.5 and 26.5 are in decile 2, and so on, up to students with marks 
			higher than 54.5 who are in decile 10.</p>
</div>

	<p class="heading">Details</p>
	<p>Unfortunately there is no commonly accepted precise definition for the lower 
		and upper quartiles &mdash; different software (and indeed different statisticians!) 
		use slightly different values. One simple definition is that the lower quartile 
		is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the middle value if 
		there is an even number of values) with a similar definition for the upper 
		quartile.</p>
	<p>In practice, the precise definition is of little practical importance, especially 
		for large data sets. The main thing to remember is to be <strong>consistent</strong> 
		with your definition if you are comparing several data sets.</p>
	<p>There are similar problems with precisely defining deciles but again the 
		precise definition used should not affect your interpretation of the data.</p>
	<p>In practice, you are advised to use the functions built into Excel to evaluate 
		quartiles and deciles.</p>
	<p class="heading">Percentiles</p>
	<p>In a similar way, the <strong>percentiles</strong> of a distribution are 
		the <strong>99</strong> values that split the data set into <strong>a hundred</strong> 
		equal parts. These percentiles can be used to categorise the individuals into 
		percentile 1, ..., percentile 100.</p>
	<p>A very large data set is required before the extreme percentiles can be estimated 
		with any accuracy. (The 'random' variability in marks is especially noticeable 
		in the extremes of a data set.)</p>

  <p class=heading>Quartiles, etc. in Excel</p>
	<p>Excel has a built-in function to evaluate the quartiles of a column of marks. 
		If the marks are contained in the cells A1 to A25 of a spreadsheet, the formula 
		&quot;=QUARTILE(A1:A25, 1)&quot; will calculate the lower quartile of the 
		distribution of marks. If the second parameter to the function is 2 or 3, 
		the median or upper quartile will be shown.</p>
	<p>In a similar way, the function &quot;=PERCENTILE(A1:A25, 5)&quot; will evaluate 
		the 5th percentile of the distribution, etc.</p>
