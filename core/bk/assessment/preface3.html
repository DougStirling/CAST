<p>Doug's interests have alternated between computer science and statistics for 
many years. He originally attended St. Andrews University in Scotland to study 
computer science, but graduated with a BSc (Hons) in statistics in 1972. After 
a year's postgraduate diploma in applied statistics in Edinburgh University, Doug 
returned to St. Andrews University where he earned an MSc in computer science. 
</p>

<p>Doug's first job was as a research assistant, and later lecturer, in the Department of
Computer Science and Statistics at Queen Mary College in the
University of London. In
1981, he emigrated to New Zealand and has been on the academic staff at Massey University
since then, teaching a wide range of statistics courses.
</p>

<p>Doug has done research on various topics, in particular contingency tables,
statistical algorithms and the use of software to teach statistical concepts.
</p>

<p class=heading>Earlier teaching software</p>

<p>After seeing his first Macintosh computer in the mid-1980s, Doug recognised the huge
potential of computers with graphical user-interfaces for teaching statistical concepts.
In 1987, he published StatLab, a Macintosh program that used simulations to teach
several statistical concepts.
</p>

<p>StatLab was followed in 1992 by Models'n'Data, another 
general-purpose program for the Macintosh that taught a wider range of statistical 
concepts. Models'n'Data allowed students to </p>

<ul>
	
<li>display and manipulate models ranging from standard univariate and bivariate 
models through to logistic models, regression and analysis of variance models, 
queuing models and even Markov Chain models</li>
	<li>generate data (samples) from these models</li>
	<li>build the empirical distribution of a range of summaries, from summary
		statistics to confidence intervals, fitted lines and p-values for hypothesis tests</li>
	
<li>analyse real data sets.</li>
</ul>

  <p>CAST packages many of the capabilities of Models'n'Data 
	into a series of simpler modules that are each targetted at teaching a single 
	statistical concept. A simpler user-interface and embedded expository text 
	make CAST much more self-contained than its predecessors. </p>
