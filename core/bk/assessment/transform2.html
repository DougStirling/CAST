  <p class="heading">Problems with linear scaling</p>

  <p>Linear scaling has its greatest effect on the highest and lowest marks in 
		a class. If you have one student whose mark is 0% and another whose mark is 
		100% and you want to keep these marks unchanged, then a simple linear scaling 
		cannot be used to increase or decrease the mean mark in the class.</p>
	<p class="heading">Piecewise linear scaling</p>
	<p>An alternative scaling method is called piecewise linear scaling. It ensures 
		that marks of 0% and 100% remain unaltered but scales up or down marks between. 
		The transformation is defined by choosing some intermediate mark and specifying 
		the mark to which it should be scaled. Marks below this mark are linearly 
		scaled and marks above it are also linearly scaled but with different parameters.</p>
	<p>For example, if we want a raw mark of 60 to be scaled up to 70, the diagram 
		below shows the piecewise scaling that is implied.</p>

	<p>We will explain how to perform this type of scaling using Excel in the next 
		page, but the diagram below helps to explain the effect of the transformation.</p>

		<p>The test was difficult and the median mark in the class was only 43, so 
			we might want to increase the median to 60. Select the cross for the student 
			(Daniel) who had a raw mark of 43.</p>
		<p>Drag the red arrow to a raw mark of 43 and scaled mark of 60. This piecewise 
			transformation has little effect on the highest and lowest marks in the 
			class, but increases the centre of the distribution of marks.</p>
