<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='center1'>Two important aspects of a distribution are its centre and its spread.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='center2'>The mean and median are descriptions of the 'centre' of a distribution. The mode is another description of a 'typical' value for discrete data.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='center3'>The median is less sensitive to outliers and is easier to interpret than the mean. However there are more 'advanced' uses of means than medians.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='center4'>The mean of discrete data does not need to be a whole number.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='center5'>The median splits a data set into two. The quartiles split it into four, deciles into 10, and percentiles into 100.</page>
