<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='inference1'>Student-to-student differences make it difficult to compare groups using the mean marks in each group.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='inference2'>The mean mark for a class is less variable than individual marks. Its standard deviation can be found and this can be used to help assess differences between groups of students.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='inference3'>Confidence intervals show the likely underlying mean within each group.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='inference4'>This page explains how to obtain confidence intervals in Excel.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='inference5'>A different formula should be used for a confidence interval for the difference between two group means.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='inference6'>If the confidence interval for the difference between two group means does not include 0, the difference is said to be 'significant'. However significant differences in large data sets are not necessarily important. And non-significant differences in small data sets may just mean that there is not enough data.</page>
