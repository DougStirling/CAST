<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='moreNormal1'>The parameters of the normal distribution are its mean and standard deviation. The best fit for a set of marks is obtained by setting these to the mean and standard deviation of the data.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='moreNormal2'>All normal distributions have the same 'shape' but different centre and spread. Any normal distribution can therefore be translated into a standard normal distribution by a simple scaling.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='moreNormal3'>All normal distributions have the same proportions of values within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean. This corresponds to standardised values between ±1, ±2, and ±3. This is a rule-of-thumb that also applies approximately to other distributions.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='moreNormal4'>Data can be standardised in the same way as a normal distribution -- subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. These are called z-scores.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='moreNormal5'>Stanines are z-scores, translated into an integer scale betweeen 1 and 9. </page>
