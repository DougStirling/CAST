<section name='What does a distribution show?'>


<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='displayInterp1'>An extreme mark should be carefully examined. Was there an error?</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='displayInterp2'>Sometimes the marks are clustered into groups. Do these clusters correspond to any other characteristics of the students?</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='displayInterp3'>Graphical displays show a 'typical' mark (centre of the distribution) and the variability of the marks (the spread of the distribution). A long tail to the distribution may also be visible (skewness).</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='displayInterp4'>Statistical software can dynamically show student names or other information. Annotating a printed display is an alternative.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='displayInterp5'>Class marks are usually small data sets (around 30 values). Features may appear by chance without any meaningful underlying cause.</page>
