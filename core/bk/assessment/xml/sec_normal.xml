<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='normal1'>The histograms of large data sets tend to be fairly smooth. A smooth curve called a probability density function may be used to summarise it.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='normal2'>One particular class of curves called the family of normal distributions is often used as a 'model' for mark data. Two 'parameters' can be adjusted to match the curve to actual data.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='normal3'>Normal distribution curves have similar properties to histograms. In particular, the proportion of values in any range equals the area under the curve.</page>
