<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='density1'>Histograms show a distribution of marks without identifying individual values. They contain less visual 'noise', especially for large data sets.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='density2'>Histogram class widths should be adjusted to give the smoothest possible outline. </page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='density3'>In a histogram, the area above any part of the axis is equal to the proportion of data values in that region.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='density4'>Histograms bins usually all have the same width. However the effect of combining two bins or splitting a bin helps explain the fundamental relationship between histogram area and proportion.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='density5'>Joining the tops of adjacent histograms gives a frequency polygon.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='density6'>A histogram is usually drawn from a frequency table. Histograms can be drawn in Excel, but not easily.</page>
