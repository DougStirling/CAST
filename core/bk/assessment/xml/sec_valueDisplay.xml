	<p>Dot plots and stem and leaf plots show each value in a data set graphically.</p>
]]></topText>


<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='valueDisplay1'>A dot plot displays each value as a cross along a numerical axis. Dot plots can be jittered or stacked to help distinguish individual crosses.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='valueDisplay2'>Stem and leaf plots are similar to stacked dot plots, but hold more information.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='valueDisplay3'>For some data sets, a basic stem and leaf plot gives too coarse a grouping of values. This page describes a simple modification that gives more flexibility in the display.</page>
<page dir='bk/assessment' filePrefix='valueDisplay4'>Dot plots can be drawn (with a little effort) in Excel. Stem and leaf plots cannot be produced in Excel but are easy to draw by hand.</page>
