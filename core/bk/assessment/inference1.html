<p class="heading">The mean varies from sample to sample and has a distribution</p>

<p>As with graphical summaries of sample data, summary statistics vary from
sample to sample. The most important summary statistic of a numerical sample
is its mean and we will concentrate on sample means in this section.
</p>

<p>Since sample means 'average out' the extremes in a sample, they are less variable than
the individual measurements in the population.
</p>

<p>The sample-to-sample variability of sample means can be described
with a distribution. (This is equivalent to considering sample means to be single
values randomly selected from a 'population' of sample means.)
</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The top half of the following diagram shows a random sample of 20 values from a normal
population (with mean 12 and standard deviation 2). The population distribution is
shown in grey. The sample mean is also displayed.
</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> to display a few random samples and their means.
Observe that the sample means are more closely concentrated round the population mean, 12,
than the individual sample values.
</p>

<p>Now click the checkbox <strong>Accumulate</strong> and take 20 or 30 further samples.
The lower display shows the means from all samples in a jittered dot plot. The distribution
of the means can be described in a similar way to the distribution of the original
sample. Its spread is lower than that of the underlying population.
</p>

<p><font color="#666666">You may click on the crosses representing the means in the
lower jittered dot plot; the sample that generated that mean is displayed above. Look
at the samples that gave rise to the highest and lowest means.</font>
