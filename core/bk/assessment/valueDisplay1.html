  <p class="heading">Graphical displays highlight density</p>

  <p>We have shown that sorting a group of marks into order can highlight which 
		ranges of marks are most and least common &mdash; in other words, the ranges of 
		values with highest and lowest <strong>density</strong> of values. Density 
		is the key to understanding the distribution of numbers in a batch, but there 
		are better ways to display density than a sorted list.</p>

<p class="heading">Dot plots</p>

<p>The simplest graphical display of a batch of numbers is a <strong>dot
plot</strong>. This shows each value as a cross (or dot) against a
numerical axis.</p>

<div class="diagram">

		<p class="heading">Maths marks example</p>

		
<p>In the previous page, we sorted a set of maths test marks into order. The sorted 
marks are listed on the left below. The marks are also displayed in a dot plot 
on the right.</p>

<td width="180"> 
	<p><strong>Drag</strong> with the mouse over values on the list to 
		highlight the corresponding cross in the dot plot. <strong>Drag</strong> 
		over crosses to highlight the corresponding value in the list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>


		
<p>Observe that when successive marks in the list are similar, the corresponding 
crosses are close together. High density is therefore shown in the dot plot with 
closely grouped crosses.</p>

		<p>Note that the 'gap' in the list between 54 and 69 is clearer in the dot 
			plot.</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">In large data sets, jittering the crosses helps show density</p>
	<p>A simple dot plot is often adequate for small data sets. However in larger 
		data sets, the crosses often overlap. Indeed, if several crosses coincide, 
		they become indistinguishable from a single cross, so high density may be 
		obscured.</p>
	<p>One solution is to randomly move the crosses perpendicularly to the axis 
		in order to separate them somewhat. This is called <strong>jittering</strong> 
		the points.</p>
	<p><font color="#666666">(You should rely on a computer to do the jittering 
		for you, but it could be done by hand by rolling a 6- or 10-sided die for 
		each cross to determine its jittering in millimetres.)</font></p>

		<p class="heading">Essay marks</p>
		
<p>The classes in an intermediate school are grouped in 'teams' of three or four 
classes. All students in one team are asked to write an essay on the same topic. 
The dot plot below shows the essay marks (out of 100).</p>

		<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider to jitter the points. <strong>Click</strong> 
			the button on the right to change the jittering &mdash; i.e. to change the random 
			vertical position of the crosses.</p>
			
		<p>Only enough jittering should be used to separate the high density of crosses 
			-- moving the slider about half way is best for the data above. Without 
			jittering, too many crosses overlap to allow us to assess the distribution 
			of marks.</p>
		<p><font color="#666666">(Note that the vertical positions of the crosses

	<p class="heading">Stacking the crosses shows density best</p>
	<p>Jittering large batches of values can provide an effective display of ranges 
		of high and low densities of values. However the randomness of the jittering 
		can be disconcerting. </p>
	
<p>A <strong>stacked dot plot</strong> uses the perpendicular axis more directly 
to show density. A stacked dot plot is obtained by:</p>
	<ol>
		<li> <strong>grouping</strong> values into 'bins', then</li>
		<li> <strong>stacking</strong> the crosses in each bin on top of each other.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>(Statisticians normally use the term 'classes' rather than 'bins' but this 
		can lead to confusion when talking about class marks.) The diagram below illustrates 
		this stacking. </p>
	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p>Click the button <strong>Animate Stacking</strong>. Blue vertical lines 
			are first drawn to define the bins. The crosses are then moved horizontally 
			to the centre of their bin, and finally the crosses are stacked.</p>

	<p>In character-based displays, the grouping is based on the width of a character,

		<p>In some data sets, grouping the data into stacks results in loss of information. 
			However this level of grouping rarely affects our interpretation of the 
			data.</p>
		<p>Each horizontal character position in the above dot plot contains a range 
			of 1 mark. Since only whole numbers of marks were awarded, there has been 
			no loss of information here. Note the peaks in the dot plot corresponding 
			to measurements ending in '0' and '5' &mdash; there has been a tendency to 'round' 
			marks to a multiple of 5!</p>
	</div>
	<p>Height is an effective way to display density in a stacked dot plot, despite 
		some loss of detail in the individual values through the grouping of crosses.</p>
