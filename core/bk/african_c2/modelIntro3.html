<p class=heading>Modelling randomness</p>

  <p>In order to understand the variability of data, we must find a <strong>model</strong> 
		that explains why repeating data collection would result in different data 
		values. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A model that explains randomness can also explain 
					the variability (accuracy) of summary statisics such as means.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class=heading>Samples from a real population</p>

  <p>In some data sets, the individuals from whom data were collected were selected 
		as representatives of a larger group of individuals about whom we are really 
		interested. </p>
		
<div class="diagram">

		<p class=heading>Opinion polls</p>

		<p>Many public opinion polls are conducted to get information about attitudes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Which candidate do you intend to vote for in the coming election?</li>
			<li>Do you use coffee brand A?</li>
			<li>How far do you travel to work or school each day?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In these polls, there is usually a well-defined population of interest 
			&mdash; all people in the region &mdash; but it would be prohibitively expensive to 
			obtain information from everyone. Furthermore, it would be impossible to 
			obtain information from everyone.</p>
		<p>Data are usually obtained from a <strong>subset</strong> of this population.</p>
</div>

	<p class=heading>Simple random samples</p>
	<p>There are various different methods of selecting individuals from a population. 
		The simplest of these is a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In a simple 
		random sample, each individual has the same chance of being selected.</p>
	<p>This mechanism (randomly selecting a sample of <em>n</em> individuals from 
		a larger population) can explain the randomness underlying the observed data.</p>
	<div class="diagram">

		<p class=heading>Shop owners in town</p>

		<p>There are 132 shops in a town that are operated by their owners (therefore 
			excluding shops that are part of national chains). The town council wants 
			to find information from these shops by interviewing their owners but has 
			neither money nor time to do this for all shops.</p>

</div>

		<p>Click <strong>Take sample </strong> a few times to take simple random samples 
			of 20 shop owners from the 132.</p>

		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A consequence of random sampling of individuals 
						is that numerical and categorical data collected from the 20 shop 
						owners is also random.</p>
</div></div>

		<p>The mean weekly turnover from the 20 sampled owners would not be identical 
			to the unknown population mean from all 132 shops, but random sampling can 
			potentially describe the variability in such a sample mean.</p>
	</div>

	<p class=heading>Modelling randomness of data with no concrete population</p>
	<p>We use a similar mechanism to model the randomness of data even when the 
		individuals are not selected from any real finite population. We model the 
		process that generates the data using a <strong>hypothetical</strong> infinite 
		population and treat the data as a simple random sample from this population.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The 'population' can be imagined to be the 
					set of all measurements that would be obtained if data collection was 
					repeated an infinite number of times.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The idea of modelling random data in terms of a hypothetical infinite population 
		is difficult to understand and will be discussed more fully later in this 
		chapter.</p>
		

	<div class="diagram">
		<p class=heading>Concrete hardness</p>

		<p>The hardness of a type of brick paver was investigated by impacting the 
			surface of 10 pavers for 1 minute and recording the volume of material eroded 
			from each.</p>
		<p>We model these data as a random sample of 10 values from a hypothetical 
			population that contains the results of repeating the experiment <strong>an 
			infinite number of times with different pavers of the same type</strong>.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>As when sampling from a real finite population, 
						the characteristics of the population are unknown in practical applications.</p>
