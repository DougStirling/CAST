<h2 class="pageName">1.2.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h2>

<p class="heading">Population and census</p>
	<p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
		fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
		group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
	<p>Collecting measurements  from every item in the  population is called a <strong>census</strong>. A census is rarely feasible,  because of the  cost and time involved.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
	<p>We can usually obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
	collecting information from a selection of units from the population &mdash; a <strong>sample</strong>. Although a sample gives less accurate information than a census, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample  is  
		a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In it, each unit has the same chance 
		of being selected and some random mechanism is used to determine whether any particular unit is 
		included in the sample.	</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	<p>It is convenient 
		to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
		than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
		corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.2.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Variability</p>
	<p>Sampling from a population results in sample-to-sample variability in the information that we obtain from the samples.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/popSamp/images/samplingHistos.gif" width="428" height="336"></p>
	<p class="heading">Sample information about the population</p>
	<p>In practice, we only have a single sample and this provides  <strong>incomplete information about the population</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/popSamp/images/samplingHistos2.gif" width="423" height="120"></p>
	<p class="heading">Effect of sample size</p>
	<p>Bigger samples mean more stable and reliable information about the underlying population.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h2>

<p class=heading>Estimating means and proportions</p>
	<p>A random sample is often used to <strong>estimate</strong> some  numerical characteristic of the population, such as...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The mean of some variable</li>
		<li>The proportion in some category</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The difference between an estimate and the population value being estimated is called 
		its <strong>sampling error</strong>. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/popSamp/images/s_propnMean.gif" width="494" height="394"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.4 &nbsp; Sampling error and sample size</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Effect of sample size on sampling error</p>
	<p>The larger the sample size, the smaller the sampling error. However when the 
		population is large, sampling a small proportion of the population may still give 
		accurate estimates. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Sampling error depends much more strongly on the sample size than 
				on the proportion of the population that is sampled.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>For example, a sample of 10 from a population of 10,000 people will estimate 
		the proportion of males almost as accurately as a sample of size 10 from a population 
		of 100.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The cost savings from using a sample instead of a full census can 
				be huge.</p>
</div></div>

	



<h2 class="pageName">1.2.5 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations ((optional))</h2>

<p class="heading">Different sampling schemes</p>
	<p><strong>Two 
			different</strong> ways to collect a random sample of <em>n</em> values from a finite population of size <em>N</em> are common. In both sampling schemes, each population value has the same chance of being in the sample.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Sampling with replacement (SWR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWR, the first selected value is <strong>returned to the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from all <i>N</i> population values. </dd>
		<dt>Sampling without replacement (SWOR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWOR, the first selected value is <strong>removed from the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from the remaining <i>N</i> - 1 population 
		values, etc.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Since a SWR may contain the same population value more than once, it covers less of the population than SWOR. SWOR therefore gives more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Large populations and/or small samples</p>
	<p>If the sample size, <i>n</i>, is much smaller than the population size, <i>N</i>, 
		there is little practical difference between SWR and SWOR &mdash; there would be little 
		chance of the same individual being picked twice in SWR.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.6 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h2>

<p class="heading">Selecting a sample manually (raffle tickets)</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Write the names (or other identification) of all population members on identical 
			pieces of paper,</li>
		<li>Mix them thoroughly in a box</li>
		<li>Select <em>n</em> pieces of paper (with or without replacement).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This method is  rarely used in research applications.</p>
	<p class="heading">Selecting a  sample with random numbers</p>
	<p>To select a random sample without replacement using random numbers,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Number all population members, starting from index 0.</li>
		<li>Generate a random index between 0 and the largest population index.</li>
		<li>If sampling <strong>without</strong> replacement and the generated index has already been selected, go back to step 2 and select another index.<br>
		</li>
		<li>Add the selected population member to the sample, then repeat steps 2. and 3. until a large enough sample has been selected.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="heading">Random number between 0 and <em>k</em></p>
	<p>The easiest way to generate a random number between 0 and 357 is to use a spreadsheet such as Excel &mdash; it has a function designed for this purpose, &quot;=RANDBETWEEN(0, 357)&quot;. A computer-generated random value is strictly called a <em>pseudo-random</em> number.</p>
	<p>If a computer is not available, a sequence of random digits can be generated:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px;"><tr>
<td>
	<ul>
		<li>Roll a 10-sided die several times.</li>
		<li>In a printed book of random digits, start at a random position in a random page, then use 
			a sequence of digits starting from there.</li>
	</ul></td>
<td style="padding-left:12px;"><img src="../../../en/popSamp/images/die.png" width="150" height="123"></td>
</tr></table>

	<p>A random number that is equally likely to have any value between 0 and 357 can be found by repeatedly generating 3-digit numbers (between 0 and 999) until a value between 0 and 357 is obtained.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">1.3 &nbsp; Samples from distributions</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.3.1 &nbsp; Data as representatives</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Generalising from data</p>
	<p>Most data sets do <strong>not</strong> arise from randomly sampling individuals from a finite population. However we are still rarely interested in the specific individuals from whom data 
		were collected.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The recorded data are often 'representative' of something 
					more general.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The main aim  is to <strong>generalise from the data</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/infPopn/images/silkworms.gif" width="559" height="209" class="summaryPict"></p>

  
  


<h2 class="pageName">1.3.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h2>

<p class=heading>Randomness of data</p>
	<p>Not only do we usually have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data were collected, but we must also acknowledge that our data would have been different if, by chance, we had selected different individuals or even made our measurements at a different time.</p>
	<p>We must acknowledge 
		this sample-to-sample variability when interpreting the data. The data are <strong>random</strong>.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>All graphical and numerical summaries would 
					be different if we repeated data collection.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>This randomness in the data must be taken into account when we interpret graphical and numerical summaries. Our conclusions should not be dependent on features  that are specific to our particular data but would (probably) be different if the data were collected again.</p>
	<p>The more data that we collect, the more accurately our  data will reflect population characteristics, but randomness always exists.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.3.3 &nbsp; Model to explain randomness</h2>

<p class=heading>Data that are <span class="red">not</span> sampled from a finite population</p>
	<p>There is   no real finite population underlying most data sets   from which the values can be treated 
		as being sampled. The randomness in such data must be explained in a different way.</p>
	<p class=heading>Sampling from an abstract  population</p>
	<p>&quot;Random sampling from a population&quot; is  also used to explain variability even when there is no <strong>real</strong> finite population from which the data were sampled.</p>
	<p>We imagine an <strong>abstract</strong> population of <strong>all values that might have been obtained</strong> if the data collection had been repeated. We can then treat the observed data as a random sample from this abstract population.</p>
	<p>Defining such an underlying population therefore not only explains sample-to-sample variability but also gives us a focus for generalising from  our specific data.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.3.4 &nbsp; Infinite populations (distributions)</h2>

<p class=heading>Distributions</p>
	<p>When an abstract population is imagined to underlie a data set, it  often
contains an infinite number of values. For example, consider the lifetimes of
a sample of light bulbs. The population of <strong>possible</strong> failure
times contains <strong>all</strong> values greater than zero, and this includes
an infinite number of values. Moreover, some of these possible values will be
more likely than others.</p>
	<p>This kind of underlying population is called a <strong>distribution</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading>Positions of cow in a field</p>
	<p>Consider the positions of a cow in a field at 6 different times where all locations are equally likely.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/infPopn/images/s_cows.gif" width="400" height="377"></p>
	<p>The population here contains all possible positions and is therefore infinite.</p>
	<p>The idea of a distribution also allows for some possible values to be more likely than others &mdash; the cow may be more likely to be in some particular part of the field.</p>


  


<h2 class="pageName">1.3.5 &nbsp; Information from a sample</h2>

<p class="heading">Sampling from a population</p>
	<p>Sampling from an underlying population (whether finite or infinite) gives us a mechanism to explain the randomness of data. The underlying population also gives us a <strong>focus</strong> for generalising from our sample data &mdash; the distribution of values in the population is fixed and does not depend on the specific sample data.</p>
	<p class="heading">Unknown population</p>
	<p>Unfortunately the population underlying most data sets is unknown and, in practice, we only have a <strong>single sample</strong>. However this single sample does throw light on the population distribution.</p>
	<p>The diagram below describes a sample from a categorical distribution. Although the underlying population is unknown, the sample proportion of successes, <em>p</em>, is an <strong>estimate</strong> of the unknown proportions of successes in the population (denoted by π).</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/infPopn/images/s_unknownP.gif" width="326" height="301"></p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">1.4 &nbsp; Probability &amp; probability density</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.4.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Probabilities for a finite population</p>
	<p>Random sampling from populations is described using <strong>probability</strong>. 
		If one value is sampled from a finite population of <em>N</em> distinct values, 
		we say that </p>
	<ul>
		<li>each population value has probability <sup>1</sup>/<sub><em>N</em></sub> of 
			being selected.</li>
		<li>there is zero probability of obtaining a value that is not in the population.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Many populations contain values that occur more than once. When sampling from <strong>any</strong> population,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>The probability that a single sampled value is either <em>x, <em>y</em>, ...</em> is the <strong>proportion 
			of population values that are either <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, ... </strong>.</p>
	</div></div>
	<p>For numerical populations, the most useful form  of this result is:</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Prob( <em>a</em> &lt; <em>X</em> &lt; <em>b</em> ) &nbsp; = &nbsp; propn of values between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</p>
	</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.2 &nbsp; Probabilities with infinite populations</h2>

<p class="heading">Probability and population proportion</p>
	<p>When sampling from any population, whether finite or infinite,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>The probability of sampling any value or range of values equals the <strong>proportion of these values in the population</strong>.</p>
	</div></div>
	<p class="heading">Probability and long-term proportion</p>
	<p>An alternative but equivalent way to think about probability arises when we can imagine repeatedly selecting more and more values from the population (e.g. repeating an experiment). The probability of any value or range of values is the <strong>limiting proportion of these values as the sample size increases</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/s_largeNos.gif" width="493" height="308"></p>
	<p>The equivalence of the two definitions is called the <strong>law of large numbers</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.3 &nbsp; Bar charts of discrete probabilities</h2>

<p class="heading">Describing   categorical and discrete populations</p>
	<p>Categorical and discrete samples can be described graphically with bar charts of the proportions for the distinct values. Since probabilities are defined to be population proportions, the underlying population can also be described by a bar chart.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probDensity/images/barChart.gif" width="206" height="194"></p>
	<p class="heading">Bar charts and the law of large numbers</p>
	<p>The law of large numbers states that sample proportions approach  the underlying probabilities as the sample size increases. This means that a sample bar chart will be close in shape to the unknown population bar chart if the sample size is big enough.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.4 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Histograms and probability density functions</p>
	<p>The situation is a little more complicated for continuous numerical populations and samples. A standard histogram could be used to describe the population in the same way that it might be used for a sample:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probDensity/images/histogram.gif" width="192" height="154"></p>
	<p>However with an infinite population, we can narrow the histogram classes beyond what would be reasonable for a finite sample. Indeed, class widths can be reduced indefinitely, resulting in a smooth histogram called a <strong>probability density function</strong>. This is often abbreviated to a <strong>pdf</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probDensity/images/pdf.gif" width="192" height="154"></p>
	<p>Probability density functions are still essentially histograms and share all properties of histograms.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.5 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2>

<p class="heading">Shape of a probability density function</p>
	<p>A probability density function  is usually a fairly smooth curve, though a single sample histogram  provides limited information about its likely shape.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/unknownPopn.gif" alt="sample &mdash;> popn?" width="362" height="236" class="summaryPict"> </p>
	<p class="heading">Normal distributions</p>
	<p>One  flexible group of  continuous probability density functions is the family of <strong>normal 
		distributions</strong>. Normal distributions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Are symmetric.</li>
		<li>Have a parameter called µ that is the mean of the population.</li>
		<li> Have a parameter σ that is the population's standard deviation.
</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Changing the parameters µ and σ changes where the distribution is centred and its spread, but its shape remains otherwise the same.</p>
	<p>The parameters are often <strong>estimated</strong> from a sample. Details will be given later, but the resulting normal pdf will be close in shape to a histogram of the sample data.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/s_bestFit.gif" width="404" height="202"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.6 &nbsp; Probability and area under the pdf</h2>

<p class=heading>Probabilities from a histogram</p>
	<p>In the histogram of any finite sample or population, the area above any class <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('density5')">is 
		the proportion of values in the class</a>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/s_histoArea.gif" width="455" height="254"></p>
	<p class="heading">Probabilities from a probability density function</p>
	<p>Since a probability density function (pdf)  is a type of histogram, it satisfies the same property.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>The probability that a sampled value is within two values, P(<em>a</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<em>b</em>), equals the area under the pdf.</p>

	<p>This is the key to interpreting pdfs.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/s_pdfArea.gif" width="402" height="212"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.7 &nbsp; Properties of probability ((optional))</h2>

<p>For any events, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, the following properties always hold.</p>
	<p class="heading">Probabilities are always between 0 and 1</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>0  ≤  P(<em>A</em>)  ≤  1</p>
	</div></div>
	<p class="heading">Meaning of probabilities 0 and 1</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If the event <em>A</em> cannot happen then P(<em>A</em>)  =  0</p>
		<p>If the event <em>A</em> is certain to happen then P(<em>A</em>)  =  1</p>
	</div></div>
	<p class="heading">Probability that an event does not happen</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>P(<em>A</em> does not happen)  =  1 - P(<em>A</em>)</p>
	</div></div>
	<p class="heading">Addition law</p>
	<p>When two events cannot happen together, they are said to be <strong>mutually 
		exclusive</strong>. If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are mutually exclusive,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>P(<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>)  =  P(<em>A</em>) + P(<em>B</em>)</p>

	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>P(<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>)  &lt;  P(<em>A</em>) + P(<em>B</em>)</p>
	</div></div>
	<p class="heading">Independence</p>
	<p>When sampling  <strong>with replacement</strong> from a finite population, the choice of each value does not depend on the values previously 
		selected. The successive values are then called <strong>independent</strong>. This also holds when sampling from an infinite population (distribution).</p>
	<p>On the other hand, if sampling without replacement from a finite population, 
		successive sample values are <strong>not</strong> independent since the second value 
		selected cannot be the same as the first value, so knowing the first value affects 
		the probabilities when the second value is selected.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">1.5 &nbsp; Simulation (optional)</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.5.1 &nbsp; Probability models and simulation</h2>

<p>Probability describes situations where a random sample is selected from a population. It  is also used to model a 
	variety of <strong>other</strong> situations involving randomness.</p>
<p class=heading>Tennis match</p>
	<p>A simple model for a tennis match between two players, A and B, assumes that:</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<ul>
			<li>Probability of A winning  serve = π<sub>1</sub></li>
			<li>Probability of B winning  serve = π<sub>2</sub></li>
			<li>The results of successive points are independent</li>
			<li>The standard years of tennis</li>
		</ul>
	</div></div>
	<p>A more complex model might introduce more parameters to relax the assumption of independence.</p>
	<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
	<p>For any values of  π<sub>1</sub> and  π<sub>2</sub>, we could randomly generate the results of successive points until a match was complete.</p>
	<p>This generates an <strong>instance</strong> of the model and is called a <strong>simulation</strong>.</p>
	




<h2 class="pageName">1.5.2 &nbsp; Simulation: Will the best team win?</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Repetitions of  a simulation</p>
	<p>Repeating a simulation and observing the

	<p class=heading>Model for sport league</p>
	<p>Consider a sports league of 10 teams in which each team plays each other twice and:</p>

	<p>We will model the league with a simple model for the results of individual matches. In it, team A has over twice the probability of winning than losing, but all other teams are equally matched.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The results of all matches are independent</li>
		<li>P(draw) = 0.2 in all matches</li>
		<li>P(team A wins its matches) = 0.55 and P(A loses) = 0.25</li>
		<li>All other teams are equally matched with P(win) = P(lose) = 0.4.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Simulation</p>

	<p class="heading">Evidence of skill? </p>
	<p>A quarter of the matches in 2008/9 were draws, so we will conduct a simulation with a model in which all teams are equally matched and:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>P(draw)  =  0.25</li>
		<li>P(win)  =  P(lose)  =  0.375</li>
	</ul>
	<p>From each simulated league, we will summarise the spread of points at the end of the season using both their range and their standard deviation. After 100 simulated leagues, these measures of spread are shown below.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_leagueSpread.gif" width="476" height="352"></p>
	<p>The actual spread of points in the 2008/9 league was much higher than those that appeared in the simulations with equally matched teams, indicating that there was indeed a difference between the skill levels of the best and worst teams in the league.</p>
	



<h2 class="pageName">1.5.4 &nbsp; Assessing unusual features in data</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Interpreting a graphical summary of a sample</p>
	<p>Simulations can also help us to assess features such as outliers, clusters or skewness in a data set 
		by examining how often they appear in random samples from a population <strong>without</strong> such features.</p>
	<p>In particular, we can examine variability in samples from a normal 
		distribution that closely matches the shape of the data set. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_skewnessSim.gif" width="381" height="305"></p>
	<p>The amount of skewness  in the the actual data (top) is rarely seen in simulated normal samples (such as that shown above). This informally suggests that the the population underlying the data really is skew and not symmetric.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.5.5 &nbsp; Random numbers ((advanced))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Random values</p>
	<p>Simulations are conducted by generating random 
		values from the probability distributions in the model.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A computer program should normally be used to generate 
				random values. The program Excel contains functions that can be used.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>Generating categorical and numerical values 
		is usually based on random values that are equally likely to take any value between 0 and 1. Such a value is said to come from 
		a rectangular (or uniform) distribution between 0 and 1 and has the probability 
		density function shown below.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probSim/images/uniform01.gif" width="185" height="169"></p>
	<p>A value can be generated from a rectangular distribution with the Excel function &quot;=RAND()&quot; or, by hand, by  generating a sequence of
	random digits (e.g. by rolling a 10-sided die).</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.5.6 &nbsp; Generating categorical values ((advanced))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Generating a categorical value</p>
	<p>A random category can be generated from a rectangularly distributed random value, <span class="em black">r</span> .</p>
	<p>If P(<em>success</em>)  is denoted by the symbol <span class="black">π</span>, 
		then a <em>success</em> will be generated if <span class="em black">r</span>  is less than <span class="black">π</span>. This can be generalised as illustrated in the diagram below:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_randomCat.gif" width="340" height="274"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.5.7 &nbsp; Generating numerical values ((advanced))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Generating a continuous numerical value</p>
	<p>There are several algorithm that can efficiently generate random values from continuous distributions. For example, the Excel function &quot;=NORMSINV(RAND())&quot; generates a random value from a normal distribution with µ = 0 and σ = 1.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>The following method is simple to explain but is not recommended for general use.</p></div></div>
	<p>Consider the diagram below which encloses the distribution's probability density 
		function with a rectangle.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probSim/images/envelopeGenerator.gif" width="246" height="173"></p>
	<p>A random position within the rectangle is generated with a random rectangular horizontal and vertical positions. If it lies within the density function, the x-coordinate is the generated value. Otherwise more positions within the rectangle are generated until a point is found within the density function.</p>
