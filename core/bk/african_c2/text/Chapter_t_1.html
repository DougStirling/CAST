<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; Sampling and Variability</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Intro - generalising from data</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Data as representatives</h3>
<p>We often have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data are collected. The data are representative of some wider situation and we want to generalise from the data to describe features of this more general situation.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h3>
<p>If data collection was repeated, perhaps from different individuals, the values would be different. All such data sets should give similar but not identical information. Interpretation of a data set should take into account this randomness.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; Modelling randomness</h3>
<p>Randomness in data can be explained through random sampling of individuals from a fixed wider population. In some situations, this underlying population has a concrete existence, but this sampling mechanism can be generalised to describe randomness of any data set.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 &nbsp; Introduction to the idea of inference</h3>
<p>The questions of interest can usually be phrased in terms of the unknown underlying population. Methods for obtaining information about the population from a sample are called inference.</p>
<h2>1.2 &nbsp; Finite populations</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h3>
<p>A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h3>
<p>A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h3>
<p>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 &nbsp; Sampling error and sample size</h3>
<p>As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </p>
<h3>1.2.5 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations ((optional))</h3>
<p>Sampling with replacement from a finite population permits the same value to be selected two or more times. Sampling without replacement ensures that there are no such duplicates.</p>
<h3>1.2.6 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h3>
<p>Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</p>
<h2>1.3 &nbsp; Samples from distributions</h2>
<h3>1.3.1 &nbsp; Data as representatives</h3>
<p>We often have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data are collected. The data are representative of some wider situation and we want to generalise from the data to describe features of this more general situation.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h3>
<p>If data collection was repeated, perhaps from different individuals, the values would be different. All such data sets should give similar but not identical information. Interpretation of a data set should take into account this randomness.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 &nbsp; Model to explain randomness</h3>
<p>Many data sets are not generated as random samples from real finite populations. However it is often useful to treat the data as a random sample from some abstract population containing the measurements that might have been recorded.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 &nbsp; Infinite populations (distributions)</h3>
<p>The populations that are imagined to underly data often contain an infinite number of values and are called distributions.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 &nbsp; Information from a sample</h3>
<p>The mechanism of sampling from a population explains randomness. Although the population is unknown and we only have a single sample, the sample provides information about the population.</p>
<h2>1.4 &nbsp; Probability &amp; probability density</h2>
<h3>1.4.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h3>
<p>When randomly selecting one value from a population of N different values, the probability of getting any individual value is 1/N. More generally, the probability of sampling a value in any range is the proportion of population values in the range.</p>
<h3>1.4.2 &nbsp; Probabilities with infinite populations</h3>
<p>The probability of any type of value is again the proportion of such values in the population. It can also be interpreted as the limiting proportion from a sample of values if the sample size is increased indefinitely.</p>
<h3>1.4.3 &nbsp; Bar charts of discrete probabilities</h3>
<p>Infinite categorical or discrete populations can be described by bar charts of the probabilities.</p>
<h3>1.4.4 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h3>
<p>Infinite continuous numerical populations are described with a type of histogram called a probability density function.</p>
<h3>1.4.5 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters, µ and σ, can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</p>
<h3>1.4.6 &nbsp; Probability and area under the pdf</h3>
<p>When a value is sampled from an infinite continuous population, the probability that it is between a and b equals the area under the p.d.f. between these two values.</p>
<h3>1.4.7 &nbsp; Properties of probability ((optional))</h3>
<p>This page describes some rules that are obeyed by probabilities.</p>
<h2>1.5 &nbsp; Simulation (optional)</h2>
<h3>1.5.1 &nbsp; Probability models and simulation</h3>
<p>Probability can be used to model complex situations. A simulation of the model involves using the model's probabilities to generate an instance of the situation. Repeating the simulation can give insight into the behaviour of the system.</p>
<h3>1.5.2 &nbsp; Simulation: Will the best team win?</h3>
<p>A simulation demonstrates that the best team is often not top of a league at the end of the season even if it has a much higher probability of winning individual matches than all other teams.</p>
<h3>1.5.3 &nbsp; Is there evidence of skill in a league?</h3>
<p>A simulation of a soccer league shows that the spread of points at the end of an actual soccer season is not consistent with all teams having equal abilities.</p>
<h3>1.5.4 &nbsp; Assessing unusual features in data</h3>
<p>The variability of displays from 'regular' populations (such as normal distributions) can be used to assess features in a single data set, such as outliers, clusters or skewness.</p>
<h3>1.5.5 &nbsp; Random numbers ((advanced))</h3>
<p>Simulations are based on randomly generated values. These are generally based on random numbers for which any value between 0 and 1 is equally likely.</p>
<h3>1.5.6 &nbsp; Generating categorical values ((advanced))</h3>
<p>A random categorical value can be easily generated from a random number between 0 and 1.</p>
<h3>1.5.7 &nbsp; Generating numerical values ((advanced))</h3>
<p>Generating random numerical values from a particular distribution is harder. This page describes one such method.</p>
