<h1 class="chapterName">Chapter 8 &nbsp; Designed Experiments</h1>
<h1 class="sectionName">8.1 &nbsp; Principles of experimental design</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">8.1.1 &nbsp; Experiments and treatments</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
	<p>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
	one or more explanatory variables.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
	<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
		Depending on the type of experiment, these units could be people, animals, trees, areas in a field, shops in a retail chain, ...</p>
	<p>In the experiments that we will examine here, a single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.</p>
	<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
	<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit. These controlled characteristics are  explanatory variables and are called <strong>factors</strong> in the context of an experiment. The different values 
		of the controlled characteristics are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>
	<p>The decision about which  treatment is applied to 
				each experimental unit is called the <strong>experimental 
	design</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="pageName">8.1.2 &nbsp; Variable experimental units</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Differences between experimental units</p>
	<p>In practice, it is usually impossible to conduct experiments with experimental units that are identical. The experimental units usually  have 
  characteristics that vary from unit to unit.</p>
	<p>These differences between the experimental units result in variability in the response measurements that are made from them, even if all receive the same treatment.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.3 &nbsp; A badly designed experiment</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Bad experimental design</p>
	<p>If the treatments are allocated to experimental units in a way that is associated with their naturally varying characteristics, the apparent relationship between the treatments and the response can be distorted.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/designIntro/images/lurking2.gif" width="297" height="120"></p>
	<p>This is similar to the effect of  lurking variables in observational studies.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_varyingUnits.gif" width="371" height="334"></p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Good experimental design can avoid the potential effect of lurking 
			variables.</p>
	</div></div>
	



<h2 class="pageName">8.1.4 &nbsp; Confounding</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Confounding</p>
	<p>The design of an experiment may make it <strong>impossible</strong> to 
		disentangle the effects of the treatment and other characteristics of the experimental uits. If the treatment is perfectly correlated with another 
		variable, the effects of the two variables <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished. 
	The treatment and variable are then said to be <strong>confounded</strong>.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>It is particularly important to avoid confounding in an experiment.</p></div></div>
	<p>In an experiment, <em>treatment A</em> was applied to 10 experimental units in 2010 and <em>treatment B</em> was used on 10 similar units in 2011.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_confounded.gif" width="340" height="134"></p>
	<p>It is <strong>impossible</strong> to tell whether the higher mean response for <em>treatment A</em> than <em>treatment B</em> was caused by the different treatments or other differences between the two years.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.5 &nbsp; Randomisation</h2>

<p class="heading">Avoiding lurking variables</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>An important goal of experimental design is to minimise association 
	between allocation of the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units.</p></div></div>
	<p>If the varying characteristics of the experimental units are understood and measured before the experiment is conducted, treatments can be allocated to ensure that there is no association. (See the later page about <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('designIntro7')">blocking in experiments</a>.)</p>
	<p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
	<p>When the differing characteristics of the experimental units are unmeasured, 
		 association between them and the treatments can be minimised by randomly 
		allocating treatments to the experimental units. This is called <strong>randomisation</strong> of the treatments and the experimental design is called a <strong>completely randomised 
			design</strong>. </p>
	<p>Randomisation does not <strong>guarantee</strong> that there will be no association 
		between the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units &mdash; by chance, 
		there may be some association. However...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Randomisation means that is unlikely that such lurking 
				variables will affect the conclusions.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Mechanics of randomisation</p>
	<p>The simplest way to randomise allocation of treatments to the experimental units is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Number the available experimental units from 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Find a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Allocate the treatments in order to the unit numbers given by the permutation.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Finding the random permutation is fairly easy in a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write the numbers 1 to <em>n</em> in a spreadsheet column</li>
		<li>Generate random numbers in an adjacent column &mdash; in Excel, type &quot;=RAND()&quot; in each cell.</li>
		<li>Select the two columns and use a menu command to sort the rows into ascending order of the random numbers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This gives a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_randomisation.gif" width="482" height="281"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.6 &nbsp; Replication</h2>

<p class="heading">Causes of variation</p>
	<p>In a completely randomised experiment,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some variation in the response measurements is caused by <strong>differences between the treatments</strong>. The experiment is conducted to discover the effect of the treatments.</li>
		<li><strong>Random variation</strong> is a catch-all that refers to all variation  that cannot 
		be explained in terms of the treatments.</li>
	</ul>
<p class="heading">Distinguishing the treatment effect and random variation</p>
	<p>To find the effect of the treatments on the response, it is essentionl that we can distinguish it from random 
	variation.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>There must be enough data to <strong>estimate random variation</strong> separately from variation caused by the treatments. </p>
	</div></div>
	<p><strong>Replication</strong> involves repeat measurements for each treatment. The variation <strong>within</strong> each treatment is all random variation.</p>
	<p>Understanding the amount of random variation is necessary before you can interpret the effect of the treatments.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_replication.gif" width="550" height="335"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.7 &nbsp; Blocking</h2>

<p class="heading">Known differences between the experimental units</p>
	<p>When nothing is known about the differences between the experimental units 
		before the experiment is conducted, we can do no better than to randomise allocation 
		of treatments to the units.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>This design can be improved when more is known about the differences between the experimental 
				units.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Randomised block designs</p>
	<p>Ideally all experimental units are virtually identical (minimum random variation) but in practice they are often highly variable. A better design groups similar experimental units into <strong>blocks</strong>.</p>
	<p>In a <strong>randomised block design</strong>, a separate experiment is conducted within each block with  treatments  randomly allocated to its experimental units. Although all data are analysed together, the lower random variation <strong>within each block</strong>  means that differences between the treatments can be more accurately estimated.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple block design</p>
	<p>Although it is not essential,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If possible, researchers usually try to define blocks that have the same size and use each treatment the same number of times within each block. </p>
	</div></div>
	<p>With  equal replicates for all treatments in every block, each treatment  mean  uses the same number of values in each block, so comparisons between treatment means are not affected by differences between the blocks.</p>

	<p>In the example above, the experimental units were grouped into blocks of six, with each treatment randomly allocated to three within each block. Even though the response values are much higher in Block 1, this affects both treatment means equally, so the difference between them is unaffected.</p>
	<p class="heading">Comparison of completely randomised and randomised block designs</p>
	<p>Grouping experimental units into blocks of similar units and using a randomised block design gives more accurate estimates of the treatment effects than a completely randomised design that ignores the blocks.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">8.2 &nbsp; Pairing and blocks</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">8.2.1 &nbsp; Aim of similar experimental units</h2>

<p class="heading">Variability of experimental units</p>
	<p>Variability between experimental units increases the variability in resulting response  measurements and this 'noise' in the data makes it harder to detect differences cause by the experimental treatments.</p>
	<p>In an experiment, we therefore  try to use experimental units that are as similar as possible. </p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.2.2 &nbsp; Experiment with matched pairs</h2>

<p class="heading">Unavoidable variation in experimental units</p>
	<p>Identical experimental units result in the most accurate estimates of the effect of a factor. In practice however, we usually have little choice and the available experimental units  are often very variable.</p>
	<p>If we have no  prior knowledge of the experimental units, a completely randomised experiment is the best possible design.</p>
	<p class="heading">Matched pairs</p>
	<p>Knowing something about the characteristics of the experimental units allows us to do better.</p>
	<p>A simple example arises when there are two treatments. A <strong>matched pairs</strong> design groups the experimental units into pairs that are similar (using either numerical measurements about the units or a subjective judgement). The two treatments are randomly allocated within each pair.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.2.3 &nbsp; Randomisation in paired experiments</h2>

<p class="heading">Importance of randomisation</p>
	<p>The most important aspect of a paired experimental design is that:</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>The  two factor levels should be allocated <strong>at random</strong> to the two experimental units in each pair.</p>
	</div></div>
	<p>If the factor levels are allocated in a subjective way within each pair, it is possible for the treatment allocation to be associated with some lurking variable that will bias the results.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.2.4 &nbsp; Matched groups of 3 or more units</h2>

<p class="heading">Matched groups to compare 3 or more factor levels</p>
	<p>The idea of using matched pairs of experimental units to give more accurate comparisons of two factor levels can be generalised to experiments with 3 or more factor levels.</p>
	<p>The experimental units can be grouped into collections of similar units whose size equals the number of factor levels. The different factor levels are randomly allocated to the units within each such matched group.</p>
	<p>Again, this type of experiment results in more accurate estimates of the differences between the factor levels than a completely randomised experiment.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.2.5 &nbsp; Randomised block experiments</h2>

<p class="heading">Blocks of similar experimental units</p>
	<p>Experiments with matched pairs or matched groups are special kinds of <strong>randomised block</strong> experiments. In them, a collection of experimental units is grouped based on similar weights, ages, etc. In other situations, the experimental units naturally separate into groups.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Time</dt>
		<dd>It may be impossible to conduct the whole experiment at once. Runs of the experiment at different times should be treated as blocks.</dd>
		<dt>Position</dt>
		<dd>Different experimental units	may be located in different research stations, farms,  fields in the same farm, or even benches in a greenhouse. These different locations should be treated as blocks.</dd>
		<dt>Groups of individuals</dt>
		<dd>Animals may need to be managed in different herds or kept in groups in a few cages. These groupings should be treated as blocks.</dd>
	</dl>
<p>If the number of experimental units in each block is a multiple of the number of factor levels in the experiment, it is possible to randomly allocate each factor level the same number of times within each block. The resulting experiment is called a <strong>randomised block</strong> <strong>design</strong>.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">8.3 &nbsp; Two or more factors</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">8.3.1 &nbsp; Experiments with 2 factors</h2>

<p class="heading">Separate experiments to assess the effects of two factors</p>
<p>The simplest way to study the effects of two factors on a response is with two separate completely randomised 
		experiments. In each of these experiments, one factor is kept constant and the other factor is varied. However...</p>

<h2 class="pageName">8.3.3 &nbsp; Simple model for two factors</h2>

<p class="heading">Model without interaction between the factors</p>
	<p>The simplest model for the effect of two factors on a response is an additive one of the form:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><span class="black">(<em>mean response</em>) &nbsp; = &nbsp; (<em>base value</em>) &nbsp; + &nbsp; (<em><span class="darkblue">effect of factor A</span></em>) &nbsp; + &nbsp; (<span class="em darkred">effect of factor B</span> <span class="darkred">)</span></span></p>
	<p>One implication of this model is that the effect on the response of changing the level of factor A is the same, whatever the level of factor B. In a similar way, the model assumes that the effect of changing factor B is the same whatever the level of factor A.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designTwo/images/s_noInteraction.gif" width="537" height="280"></p>
	<p>If this model holds, the effects of the two factors can be separately described in a table of means.</p>

	<p>It should be noted that this model does not always hold.  <strong>Interaction</strong> between the effects of A and B occurs if the effect of changing B is different for different levels of A (and vice versa).</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.3.4 &nbsp; Interaction between factors</h2>

<p class="heading">Interaction</p>
	<p>If the effect of changing one factor is different for different levels of the other factor, there is said to be an <strong>interaction</strong> between the effects of the two factors.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designTwo/images/s_interaction.gif" width="537" height="280"></p>
	<p>An important reason for using a factorial experimental design is that it allows you to detect interaction.</p>
	<p>Summarising the results of experiments is usually easier if there is no interaction between the factors. However if interaction exists, it is important that it is discovered and described.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.3.5 &nbsp; Example with interaction</h2>

<p class=heading>Hay fever relief</p>
	<p>A study was conducted to investigate the effect of a drug compound in providing 
		relief for hay fever. In the experiment, two active ingredients (A and B) 
		were each varied at 3 levels in a factorial design with 4 replicates. There

<h2 class="pageName">8.3.6 &nbsp; No-interaction model for three factors</h2>

<p class="heading">Simple model for three factors</p>
	<p>The simplest model for data from a factorial experiment assumes that there 
		is no interaction between the effects of any of the factors &mdash; each acts additively on 
		the response. For an experiment with 3 factors, this implies that...</p>
	<p class="eqn" style="margin-bottom:5px;"><span class="black">(<em>mean response</em>) &nbsp; = &nbsp; (<em>base value</em>) &nbsp; + &nbsp; (<em><span class="darkblue">effect of factor A</span></em>) &nbsp; + &nbsp; (<span class="em darkred">effect of factor B</span> <span class="darkred">)</span></span></p>
	<p class="eqn" style="margin-left:250px; margin-top:0"><span class="black">+</span> &nbsp; <span class="green">(<em>effect of factor C</em>)</span>	</p>
	<p>This model can be illustrated in a 3-dimensional examination. All lines are parallel if there is no interaction.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designTwo/images/s_3Factor.gif" width="344" height="315"></p>
	<p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
	<p>As in all other experiments, it is important to remember that the treatments (factor combinations) should be <strong>randomly allocated</strong> to the  
		experimental 
		units &mdash; randomisation of the experiment.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.3.7 &nbsp; Interaction in 3-factor designs</h2>

<p class="heading">Interaction</p>
	<p>It must be stressed again that the no-interaction model does not always fit 
		factorial data. Sometimes the effect of one factor is different for different 
		levels of the others. Interactions in models with 3 or more factors are however 
		difficult to understand, so we only briefly mention their existence here.</p>
	<p class=heading>Shrimp culture</p>
	<p>Scientists conducted a factorial experiment to assess how shrimp growth was affected

<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">8.4 &nbsp; Practical issues in design</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">8.4.1 &nbsp; Purpose</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">What is the purpose of the experiment?</p>
	<p>Before conducting an experiment it is important to clearly state its objectives.  In defining the goals of the experiment, it is 
		important that people with intimate knowledge of the process or subject area are 
	included in the team which is charged with designing and running the experiment. </p>
<p>Quite frequently,... </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A clear statement of the problem can lead to process improvement without 
				any experimentation, simply through creating a greater understanding of the process.</p>
</div></div>





<h2 class="pageName">8.4.2 &nbsp; Experimental units and measurements</h2>

<p class=heading>What experimental units should be used?</p>
	<p>It is desirable for experimental units to be as similar as possible, so every
		attempt should be made to make the experimental units homogeneous.	</p>
	<p>Often however, the experimenter has little influence on the choice of experimental 
		units and must contend with whatever variability exists. Grouping them into block of similar units (and using a randomised block design) will make the results more accurate.</p>
	<p class="heading">What response variable should be recorded?</p>
	<p>In an experiment, there is sometimes a single obvious response measurement 
		from an experimental unit, but often there are several variables which can be considered 
		as response measurements.</p>
<p>A subject expert would need to decide on which 
		was most relevant to the aims of the experiment.</p>
	<p class=heading> Controlled variables</p>
	<p>Thought also needs to be given to which variables need to be controlled
		(the input variables) and what settings should be used for these variables
		in different experimental runs.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.4.3 &nbsp; Experiments with human subjects</h2>

<p class="heading">Ethical issues arise</p>
	<p>There are a few practicalities that complicate experimentation with human subjects.
		For ethical reasons, experiments involving potential danger to the subjects are not
		possible. Even if there is no known danger, the subjects should be aware of what is
		involved in the experiment and must give informed consent. </p>
	<p class=heading> Controls</p>
	<p>Treatments that involve change  should usually be compared to a  'treatment' in which there is no change. Individuals for whom there has been no change are called <strong>controls</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading> Placebos</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the act of administering a treatment to a human subject may itself
		affect the response, irrespective of the treatment effect. For example, if a drug
		is being assessed for its ability to reduce headaches, the knowledge that medication
		has been administered may make the subject feel better, even if the drug has no active
		ingredient. </p>
	<p>To avoid the psychological effect of the treatment on the subject being confounded 
		with the effect of the drug, an indistinguishable 'treatment' with no effect may 
		be given to the control group of subjects; this is called a <strong>placebo</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading> Double-blind experiments</p>
	<p>A further complication may arise when the measured response from each subject
		may be affected by knowledge of the treatment applied. If the experimenter knows
		which treatment has been applied to each experimental unit, there may be a
		subconscious tendency to systematically over- or under-assess one treatment.</p>
	<p>In a <strong>double-blind</strong> experiment, neither the experimenter 
		not the subject knows which treatment has been applied. Again, the aim is to ensure that other factors 
		do not act as lurking variables to confound comparisons of the treatments.</p>
