<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Distributions</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Distribution of sample mean</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Variability of sample statistics</h3>
<p>A summary value describing a population is called a parameter and the corresponding value in a sample is called a statistic. Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Variability of sample mean</h3>
<p>A sample mean has a distribution that is centred round the population mean but has smaller spread than the population.</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Standard devn of sample mean</h3>
<p>The spread of the sample mean decreases as sample size increases. A formula is given for the standard deviation of the sample mean in terms of the sample size and population standard deviation.</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Means from normal populations</h3>
<p>Sample means from normal populations also have normal distributions.</p>
<h3>2.1.5 &nbsp; Large-sample normality of means</h3>
<p>The shape of the sample mean's distribution is usually close to normal, even if the population distribution is skew or multimodal. The bigger the sample size, the closer the distribution to normal.</p>
<h3>2.1.6 &nbsp; Distribution of mean from a sample</h3>
<p>It is possible to estimate the distribution of a sample mean from a single sample.</p>
<h3>2.1.7 &nbsp; Requirement of independence</h3>
<p>If the sample values are positively correlated, the standard deviation of the mean will be underestimated.</p>
<h3>2.1.8 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations ((advanced))</h3>
<p>If a random sample is selected without replacement, the formula for the standard deviation of the sample mean must be modified.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Importance of normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are sometimes useful as models for data, but the main reason for their importance is that sample means and many other summary statistics have approximately normal distributions.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Shape of normal distributions</h3>
<p>All normal distributions look the same on a scale of standard deviations from the mean.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Sketching a normal distribution</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are centred on their mean, µ, and have hardly any area beyond 3σ  on each side. A small area (about 5%) is over 2 standard deviations away from the mean.</p>
<h3>2.2.4 &nbsp; Some normal probabilities</h3>
<p>The probabilities of being within (σ, 2σ, and 3σ) of the mean are (0.68, 0.95 and 0.997) for all normal distributions. This is a close match to the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb for numerical data sets.</p>
<h3>2.2.5 &nbsp; Z-scores</h3>
<p>Any value, x, can be translated into a z-score that gives the number of standard deviations above the mean.</p>
<h3>2.2.6 &nbsp; Finding normal probabilities</h3>
<p>Z-scores have a standard normal distribution (µ = 0 and σ = 1). The probability of a value less than x can be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>2.2.7 &nbsp; Other probabilities</h3>
<p>The probability that X is greater than a specified value or is between two values can also be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>2.2.8 &nbsp; Normal tables</h3>
<p>If a computer is not available, tables of probabilities for the standard normal distribution are used to find normal probabilities.</p>
<h3>2.2.9 &nbsp; Finding normal quantiles</h3>
<p>The inverse problem of finding the x-value corresponding to a given probability is also solved using z-scores. If normal tables are used, they must be looked up differently.</p>
<h3>2.2.10 &nbsp; Normal probability plots ((advanced))</h3>
<p>A normal probability plot is an informal graphical method to help assess whether a data set comes from a normal distribution. Curvature in the probability plot suggests that the data may not be normal.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of sample proportion</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; Proportion and probability</h3>
<p>The population proportion in a category is called its probability. Proportions and probabilities can be obtained from categorical and numerical variables.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Properties of counts and proportions</h3>
<p>The sample proportion is a statistic that varies from sample to sample. The sample count in a category is also random with a discrete distribution.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Binomial distribution</h3>
<p>The sample count in a category has a standard distribution called a binomial distribution with parameters n and π.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 &nbsp; Binomial probability examples</h3>
<p>The binomial distribution can be used to find probabilities relating to sample counts.</p>
<h3>2.3.5 &nbsp; Normal approximation to binomial</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, the distribution of the sample count in a category becomes close to a normal distribution.</p>
<h3>2.3.6 &nbsp; Normal approximation examples</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find binomial probabilities.</p>
