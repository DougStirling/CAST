<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Testing a Mean</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Tests about means</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>For numerical populations, the null and alternative hypotheses usually specify values for the population mean. Tests are based on the sample mean.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Test for mean (known Ïƒ)</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the distribution of the sample mean can be found when the null hypothesis is true. The p-value for the test is a tail area of this distribution.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; P-value from statistical distance</h3>
<p>The p-value is most easily found from the 'statistical distance' between the sample and hypothesised means. The p-value can be found as a tail area of the standard normal distribution and is approximately correct even when the population distribution is not normal.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; The t distribution</h3>
<p>When the population standard deviation is unknown, a different test statistic must be used. It has a standard distribution known as a t distribution.</p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; The t test for a mean</h3>
<p>The t distribution is used to obtain a p-value for tests about a population mean when the standard deviation is unknown.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Properties of p-values</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Null and alternative hypotheses</h3>
<p>Hypothesis tests ask whether the sample data are consistent with a statement about the parameters called the null hypothesis.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Consistency with null hypothesis</h3>
<p>A p-value is a numerical measure of whether the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of p-values</h3>
<p>When the null hypothesis is true, any p-value between 0 and 1 is equally likely. When the alternative hypothesis is true, p-values near 0 are more likely. A p-value near 0 therefore gives evidence that the alternative hypothesis holds.</p>
<h3>6.2.4 &nbsp; Interpretation of a p-value</h3>
<p>A p-value is the probability of getting such 'extreme' data when the null hypothesis holds.</p>
<h3>6.2.5 &nbsp; P-values for other tests</h3>
<p>P-values have the same properties and interpretation for all tests. A test for whether a population has a normal distribution is used as an example.</p>
