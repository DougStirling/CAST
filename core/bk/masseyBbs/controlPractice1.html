<p class="heading">Control chart principles</p>
	<p>The previous section described the main principles behind control charts. One or more measurements are made from the output of a process at regular intervals and are plotted on a control chart.</p>
	<p>Upper and lower control limits are determined from data that were collected when the process was known to be in control. From these data, we can determine the common cause variation and hence the variability of the measurement when the process is in control. Since measurements are rarely more than 3 standard deviations from the mean, the control limits are defined to be:</p>
	<p class="eqn">(mean measurement)&nbsp; ± &nbsp; 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;sd (measurement)</p>
	<p>Future measurements outside the control limits are unlikely if the process remains in control, so any such measurements are taken to indicate that the process may be out of control &mdash; i.e. that there is special cause variation.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>In this section, we will concentrate on observations that breach the control
limits to indicate a process that is out of control.</p>
	</div></div>
	<p>The other triggers described in the previous section (and, in particular an increasing
sequence of measurements or a run on the same side of the mean) can also be used
to detect special causes.</p>
	<p class="heading">Control charts based on samples</p>
  <p>In the previous section, we only considered a single numerical measurement at each time point. This is rare, partly because our definition of the control limits is symmetric around the mean and this is not ideal for measurements with skew distributions.</p>
  <p>In practice, a small <strong>sample</strong> of measurements is usually recorded at each time. By creating separate control charts for the sample means and sample ranges, we can separately assess the process mean and its variability. Changes to both are extremely important:</p>
  <dl>
  	<dt>Process mean</dt>
  	<dd>If the weight of cornflake packets from a production line increases or decreases, either product is being wasted or consumers are likely to complain.</dd>
  	<dt>Process variability</dt>
  	<dd>Consumers prefer a consistent product.</dd>
 	</dl>
<p>If a sample is recorded at each time point, separate control charts can be constructed from the sample mean and the sample range. These can be used to separately assess whether the mean and variability of the process becomes out of control.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>Control charts for means and ranges are constructed in a similar way to  run charts but the details differ.</p>
