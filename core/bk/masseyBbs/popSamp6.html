<p class="heading">Selecting a sample manually</p>

<p>When choosing a random sample, each population member must have the same chance 
of being included in the sample. How can we select a random sample in practice? 
One method of selecting a random sample of size <em>n</em> is...</p>
<ol>
<li>write the names (or other identification) of all population members on identical 
pieces of paper,</li>
<li>mix them thoroughly in a box</li>
<li>select <em>n</em> pieces of paper (with or without replacement).</li>
</ol>

<p>This method is however impractical for large populations.</p>
<p class="heading">Random digits</p>
<p>An alternative method of selecting a random sample involves generating random 
digits (0, 1, ..., 9). There are several ways to generate random digits such that 
each has the same chance of appearing.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin:0px;">
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Roll a 10-sided 
die several times. (6-sided dice are more common, but 10-sided dice are also used 
in various games &mdash; especially fantasy games.)</li>
<li>Books of random digits have been published. Open a page at random then use 
a sequence of digits starting from an arbitrary position on the page.</li>
<li>Some computer programs (e.g. Microsoft Excel) contain functions that generate 
random numbers. (Computer-generated values should strictly be called <em>pseudo-random 
numbers</em>, but the distinction is not important here.)</li>
<li>Many calculators have a 'random number' key that generates (pseudo-) random numbers.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td valign="top" style="margin-top:10px;">
<img src="../../en/popSamp/images/die.png" width="150" height="123">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Concatenating 2 or more of these random digits gives a larger random number.</p>
<p>(In this course, we expect you to use a computer or calculator to generate random digits.)</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p>Click the button <strong>Generate digit</strong> to generate a random digit.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="300" height="100">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="samplingProg.RandomDigitApplet">
<param name="random" value="538402167">
<param name="customText" value="Generate digit=Generate digit">
</applet>
</div>

<p>Concatenating three such random digits gives a random number between 0 and 999.
Click <strong>Generate value</strong> to find a random number in this range.</p>

<p class="heading">Selecting the sample</p>

<p>To select a random sample without replacement using random numbers, we must first obtain a list of the population members. This list is called the <strong>sampling frame</strong>. We then proceed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Number all population members, starting from 0.</li>
		<li>Generate a random value with the same number of digits as the largest 
			number associated with a population member.</li>
<li>If the generated value belongs to a population member, and this member is 
not already included in the sample, add it to the sample. (Otherwise, ignore this 
random number and continue, generating another.)</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2. and 3. until a large enough sample has been selected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that values are 'rejected' in step 3 for two different reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>The random number may not belong to a population member (e.g. the random number 
may be 653 when the population members are numbered 0 to 357)</li>
<li>The population member may have already been selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The proportion of rejected values therefore depends on the population size 
and the relative size of the sample and population.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p>The diagram below illustrates sampling without replacement from a population 
of 56 individuals. They have been numbered from 0 to 55.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="550" height="400">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="samplingProg.SimulateSampleApplet">
<param name="random" value="438402167 287345678">
<param name="catVarName" value="Gender">
<param name="catLabels" value="Male Female">
<param name="popnInfo" value="7 8 2 7 5 0.5 632563625">
<param name="customText" value="Clear sample=Clear sample#Random index=Random index#Faster=Faster#Ignored: no item has index=Ignored: no item has index#Item * has been selected=Item * has been selected#Ignored: item * was previously selected=Ignored: item * was previously selected">
</applet>
</div>

<p>Click <strong>Random index</strong>. If the resulting two digits are between 
0 and 55, the corresponding individual is added to the sample. Otherwise, an error 
message appears and a new random value must be generated.</p>
<p>Repeat several times to add more individuals to the sample. Note that</p>

<ul><li>almost half of the values generated are rejected because they are outside the 
range 0 to 55, and</li>
<li>occasionally a population member is selected that is already in the sample 
&mdash; it cannot be added twice. This happens more often as the sample size increases.</li>
</ul>
