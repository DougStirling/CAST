<p class="heading">Introduction</p>
<p>In the discussions of data in previous sections of this e-book, we saw the difference
between discrete and continuous variables. For example the variable X = “gender”
is discrete as is the variable X = “number of machine breakdowns in a week”. It makes
sense to ask questions like what is the probability that X = Male,&nbsp; or the probability that X = 0 breakdowns. On the other hand the variable X = “time to effect a repair” is continuous. It is measured on a continuous scale. Questions like P(X = 0) or P(X = 1) now do not make sense. Instead we need to ask questions like P(X &lt; 1)&nbsp; or&nbsp; P(X &gt; 5).</p>
<p>For discrete probability distributions we had a discrete number of individual probabilities that add to 1, called a “probability mass function”.</p>
<p>For a continuous probability distribution, as this is not possible we need to represent and calculate probabilities as the area under a curve called a “probability density function”.</p>
