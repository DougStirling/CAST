<p class=heading>Natural variation</p>

  <p>When data are collected, all values are rarely the same and an important role of statistics is to describe and analyse this variation.   When data are collected from 'individuals', they often vary considerably.</p>
  <p>The natural variability of individuals  makes it harder to interpret information from surveys. The example below illustrates this variability with a very small survey.</p>
  <div class="diagram">
		<p class=heading>Yoghurt preferences</p>
  	<p>Food manufacturers often collect 'preference data' to discover which of 
  		several recipes for a type of product is preferred by consumers. In the 
  		example below, 30 consumers were each  given samples of strawberry yoghurt 
  		with three different types of strawberry flavouring, <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>. Each consumer reported the flavouring that was preferred.</p>

  	<p>The percentage preferring  flavouring A is shown. Click <strong>Another 30 people</strong> a few times to repeat the data 
 		collection with different groups of 30 people.</p>
  	<p>The natural variability of 
  		the people implies that the proportion preferring each flavouring varies. 
  		A full analysis of the data should take account of the variability in the 
  		proportion preferring flavouring A.</p>

  <p class=heading>Explained and unexplained variation</p>
  <p>In some types of data, we may be able to 'explain' some of the variation in a measurement in terms of other known characteristics of the individuals. Other variation remains unexplained.</p>
  <div class="diagram">
		<p class=heading>Yoghurt preferences</p>
  	<p>In the yoghurt preference example above, there may be differences between males and females. If we could tell that a particular flavouring was liked better by females than males, advertising for it could be targeted better at that gender.</p>
  	<p>Systematic differences in preference between males and females are the 'signal' in the data about which we are most interested.</p>
  	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  		<p>In this example, variation within each gender is unexplained 'noise' variation that only serves to obscure the signal.<br>
			
  		<p></p>
 		</div></div>

<br>
</div>
  <p>Sometimes data are collected from experiments in which some experimental conditions are intentionally varied.</p>
  <p>Intentional differences to experimental conditions may also cause systematic differences in variables.</p>
  <p>In many situations, information (signal) can be obscured by random variation (noise). Natural variability makes it harder to interpret experimental results.</p>
