<p class="heading">Difference between parameter and estimate</p>
<p>Many hypothesis tests are about a single parameter of the model:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A population proportion, π.</li>
	<li>A population mean, µ.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is natural to base a test about such a parameter on the corresponding sample statistic:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The sample proportion, <em>p</em>.</li>
<li>The  sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the value  of the sample statistic is close to the hypothesised value of the parameter, there is no reason to doubt the null hypothesis. However if they are far apart, the data are not consistent with the null hypothesis and we should conclude that the alternative hypothesis holds.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>A large distance between the  estimate and  hypothesized value is evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Statistical distance</p>
<p>How do we tell what is a large distance between, say, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> and
µ? The empirical rule says that we expect <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> to
be within two standard errors of µ (about 95% of the time). If we measure the
distance in standard errors, we know that 2 (standard errors) is a large distance,
3 is a very large distance, 1 is not much.</p>
<p>The number of standard errors is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../en/testMean/images/zForMean.gif" width="164" height="52"></p>
<p>In general, the <strong>statistical distance</strong> of an estimate to a hypothesised value of the underlying parameter is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../en/testMean/images/zGeneral.gif" width="185" height="37"></p>
<p>If this comes to more than 2, or less than -2, it suggests that the hypothesized value is wrong: the estimate is not consistent with the hypothesised parameter value. If, on the other hand, <em>z</em> is close to zero, the data are giving a result reasonably close to what we expected based on the hypothesis.</p>
