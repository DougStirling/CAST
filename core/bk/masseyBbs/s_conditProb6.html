<p class="heading notPrinted">Tree diagrams for two attributes</p>
<p>Two categorical variables (or types of event) are sometimes represented in a type
of diagram called a <strong>tree diagram</strong>. The main branches are 
labeled with their <strong>marginal</strong> probabilities.
The branches to the right are labeled with their <strong>conditional</strong> probabilities,
conditional on the branches to the left leading to that fork.</p>
<p>Joint probabilities can be easily found by multiplying the probabilities down
the corresponding branches. This corresponds to applying the general multiplication
rule, P(A and B) = P(A) Ã— P(B | A).</p>

<p class="heading">Sampling without replacement</p>
<p>Consider selection of two students from a class of 2 women and
4 men by &quot;pulling names out
of a hat&quot;. The following tree diagram illustrates this process.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tree_replacement.gif" width="518" height="435"></p>
<p>Note that the <strong>conditional</strong> probability
of the second student being male depends on whether the first student is male (top
branch) or female (third branch). The diagram also shows the joint probabilities
on the right and these allows us to determine the probability that one student of
each gender is selected.</p>
