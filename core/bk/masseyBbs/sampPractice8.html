<p class="heading">Cost and accuracy</p>
<p>Stratified, cluster and two-stage sampling schemes have various advantages and disadvantages, compared to a sample random sample that records information from the same number of individuals.</p>
<p>This page uses simulations to illustrate some of these differences. However these simulations involve ideas that will not be described until much later in this course.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>We suggest that you revisit this page after studying Chapter 6 of the e-book.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Stratified sampling</p>

<p>A stratified random sample  provides more accurate estimates of population characteristics than a simple random sample of the same size from the  population. The advantage of stratified sampling is greatest when the  strata differ in their mean value of the characteristic.</p>
<p>We will explain in a later chapter that the accuracy of an estimate is described by its standard deviation. A formula will be given for the standard deviation of the mean from a simple random sample.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>The ordinary formula for the standard deviation of a sample mean  will 
		<strong>under-estimate its accuracy</strong> if the mean is obtained from a stratified random sampling.</p>

<p class="heading">Weekly turnover by grocery stores</p>

<p>The diagram below shows the weekly turnover of 100 grocery stores in a city. 
Of these stores, 50 belong to large grocery chains and the other 50 are smaller 
independent stores. The 50 stores belonging to chains tend to have higher turnovers. 
(This is not real data &mdash; the difference between the two types of store is more 
extreme than would usually be observed, but does illustrate the potential gains 
from stratified sampling.)</p>

<p>The left half of the diagram illustrates simple random sampling of 10 from 
the 100 stores, whereas stratified random sampling of 5 store from each group 
is illustrated on the right.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to observe the variability of 
the mean turnover for the two sampling schemes. (A jittered dot plot of the means 
is shown to the right of each samples. A normal curve shows the distribution of 
the sample means.)</p>
<p>Observe that stratified random sampling gives sample means with less variability. 
The mean from a stratified random sample is therefore a more accurate estimate 
of the population mean.</p>

<div class="boxed">
  <p>In practice, the aim is more likely to be estimation of the <strong>total</strong> grocery turnover in the city, but this is simply 100 times the mean turnover, so stratified sampling gives the same improvement over a simple random sample.</p>
</div>

<br>
</div>

<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it is usually much cheaper to obtain information from individuals in clusters than from the same number of individuals in a simple random sample.</p>
<p>However the penalty is that the mean population characteristic is less accurately estimated.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>The ordinary formula for the standard deviation of a sample mean will <strong>over-estimate its accuracy</strong> if the mean is obtained by cluster sampling.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="diagram">
	<p>The diagram below illustrates sampling from a population of 25 clusters, each 
		of which contains 4 individuals. (The different vertical bands represent the different 
		clusters in the population.)</p>

	<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> several times to build up the distribution 
		of the mean using cluster sampling of 5 clusters. Choose <strong>Simple random 
			sample</strong> from the pop-up menu then take several more samples. Since all 
		clusters have similar spreads of values, simple random sampling and cluster sampling 
		result in sample means with similar distributions (i.e. similar accuracy). </p>
	<p>Move the slider to about half-way to accentuate the differences between the 
		clusters (the four values in each cluster become more similar) and observe that 
		this has little effect on the accuracy of the sample mean when simple random sampling 
		is used. However the sample mean becomes much more variable with cluster sampling.</p>
<div class="boxed">
		<p>Cluster sampling is as good as simple random sampling if the clusters 
			are similar, but is worse if the clusters are different.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class="heading">Two-stage sampling</p>
<p>As with cluster sampling, two-stage sampling has lower cost than simple random sampling but estimates population characteristics less accurately.</p>
<p>The number of primary units to sample is therefore a trade-off between accuracy 
	and cost. The details are beyond the scope of CAST.</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p>In the diagram below, the vertical bands separate 16 primary units, each of 
		which contains 8 individuals whose values are shown in a jittered dot plot.</p>

</applet>
</div>
	<p>Initially, all primary units are similar &mdash; their means are nearly the same. 
		Click <strong>Take sample</strong> several times to observe the sampling distribution 
		of the mean (in the pink band to the right of the population dot plots). When 
		the number of primary units sampled is changed, the distribution of the mean remains 
		the same. The most cost-effective sampling scheme is therefore to sample the smallest 
		number of primary units possible.</p>
	<p>Change the slider at the bottom to half-way between <strong>Similar</strong> and <strong>Different</strong>. Now some primary units are fairly consistently 
		higher than others. Observe that reducing the number of primary units sampled 
		now has a much greater effect on the standard deviation (and hence accuracy) of 
		the mean.</p>
</div>
<p>As with cluster and stratified sampling, formulae for the standard deviation 
	of the resulting estimates are beyond the scope of an introductory course.
