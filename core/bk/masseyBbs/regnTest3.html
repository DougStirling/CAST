<p class="heading">Correlation coefficient and p-value</p>

<p>The p-value summarizes how strong the evidence for a relationship is, with small values indicating strong evidence. This is not to be confused with how strong the relationship is &mdash; recall that we usually summarize the strength of a linear relationship with the sample correlation:</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/correlation/images/corrDefn2.gif" width="213" height="67"> 
</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the correlation coefficient, <em>r</em>, 
and the p-value for testing whether there is a relationship between <em>X</em> 
and <em>Y</em>. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Correlation coefficient</dt>
<dd>Describes the strength of the relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em></dd>
<dt>The p-value for testing whether <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are related</dt>
<dd>Describes the strength of <strong>evidence</strong> for whether <em>X</em> 
and <em>Y</em> are related <strong>at all</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>Strong relationships are easier to detect (easier to find significant evidence for), but if there is a lot of data, we can be very sure that a relationship is present even when it is weak. With very little data, sometimes a relationship is uncertain even when the correlation is fairly high. Conversely,</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>Regression models are sometimes fitted to data sets with  hundreds of thousands of observations. With so much data, there is often strong evidence of a relationship even when the correlation coefficient is close to zero and the relationship is of no practical importance.

<p>The following examples illustrate how both the sample size and the correlation 
coefficient affect the p-value.</p>
<p>In the data set at the top left, there is no evidence of a relationship between 
the variables &mdash; a correlation coefficient of 0.24 could easily have arisen by 
chance even if the variables were not related at all.</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/regnTest/images/rnEffect.gif" width="583" height="466"></p>

<p>The data set on the top right has the same correlation coefficient, 0.24. However 
its sample size is much higher and a correlation coefficient this far from zero 
is now very unlikely, so the p-value is small. There is almost certainly a relationship 
between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, even though the relationship is weak.</p>
<p>With a sample size of 30, the relationship would need to be stronger for us 
to detect it. The data set on the bottom left shows that <em>r</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.63 
gives strong evidence of a relationship with a data set of this size.</p>
