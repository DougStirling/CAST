<p class="heading">Problems with selecting a simple random sample</p>
<p>To select a simple random sample from a population, a full list is needed
of individuals in the population &mdash; a <strong>sampling frame</strong>.</p>
<p>In some situations, a sampling frame may not be available. Even if we have
a sampling frame and can select a random sample from it, the resulting list of
individuals may be difficult to use by the people doing the actual data collection.</p>
<p class="heading">Systematic samples</p>
<p>It is often easier 'on the ground' to take a <strong>systematic</strong> sample
instead of a simple random sample. A systematic sample can be used whenever the
population can be ordered into a list in some way (though we don't need a full
list before starting data collection). Only the first individual is randomly
chosen, then every 10'th, 20'th, etc. individual is included in the sample.</p>
<p>Systematic sampling can also be used to replace simple random sampling within
other sampling schemes.</p>

<dd>Systematic samples may be taken within each stratum of the population.</dd>

<dd>Systematic sampling is often used for selection of clusters (e.g. households
in a town).</dd>
