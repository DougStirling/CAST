<p class="heading">Cost and accuracy</p>
<p>Stratified, cluster and two-stage sampling schemes have various advantages and disadvantages, compared to a sample random sample that records information from the same number of individuals.</p>
<p>This page uses simulations to illustrate some of these differences. However these simulations involve ideas that will not be described until much later in this course.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>We suggest that you revisit this page after studying Chapter 6 of the e-book.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Stratified sampling</p>

<p>A stratified random sample  provides more accurate estimates of population characteristics than a simple random sample of the same size from the  population. The advantage of stratified sampling is greatest when the  strata differ in their mean value of the characteristic.</p>
<p>We will explain in a later chapter that the accuracy of an estimate is described by its standard deviation. A formula will be given for the standard deviation of the mean from a simple random sample.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The ordinary formula for the standard deviation of a sample mean  will 
		<strong>under-estimate its accuracy</strong> if the mean is obtained from a stratified random sampling.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Weekly turnover by grocery stores</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'sampPractice', 'stratified', '560', '376');</script>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>In practice, the aim is more likely to be estimation of the <strong>total</strong> grocery turnover in the city, but this is simply 100 times the mean turnover, so stratified sampling gives the same improvement over a simple random sample.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it is usually much cheaper to obtain information from individuals in clusters than from the same number of individuals in a simple random sample.</p>
<p>However the penalty is that the mean population characteristic is less accurately estimated.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The ordinary formula for the standard deviation of a sample mean will <strong>over-estimate its accuracy</strong> if the mean is obtained by cluster sampling.</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">Two-stage sampling</p>
<p>As with cluster sampling, two-stage sampling has lower cost than simple random sampling but estimates population characteristics less accurately.</p>
<p>The number of primary units to sample is therefore a trade-off between accuracy 
	and cost. The details are beyond the scope of CAST.</p>

</div>

<p>As with cluster and stratified sampling, formulae for the standard deviation 
	of the resulting estimates are beyond the scope of an introductory course.
