<p class=heading>Long-term  proportion</p>
<p>In many random situations, there are no equally likely outcomes, so the 'classical' definition of probability must be generalised.</p>
<p>We therefore define the probability of an event to be the 'long-term' proportion of times that the event would occur if  <strong>similar</strong> data were repeatedly collected.</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p class="heading">Medical insurance claims</p>
	<p>We will consider whether a claim is made on a medical insurance policy in one 
		year. The result is a categorical value (<em>claim</em> or <em>no claim</em>). The randomness of whether there is a claim on one policy can be modelled as being a value that is randomly sampled from an abstract infinite population in which a proportion of values are <em>claim</em> and the rest are <em>no claim</em>.</p>
	<p>The <strong>probability</strong> that one policy will result in a claim is the proportion of <em>claim</em> values in this underlying population.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, we can imagine examining more and more similar insurance policies. The probability of one policy resulting in a claim is also the limiting proportion of claims in this (imaginary) sequence of policies.</p>
	<div class="centred">
		<div class="boxed">
			<p>These are two different ways to think about the probability, but the value is the same.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p class="heading">Law of large numbers</p>
	<p>The diagram below illustrates the fact that a sample proportion tends to a limit as the sample size increases. (The limit is the probability.) Imagine recording the whether each of a sequence of medical insurance policies 
		has a claim during one year.</p>

	<p>Click <strong>Find new value</strong> a few times to observe a sequence of 
		policies. When only one policy has been observed, the proportion with claims must 
		be either 0 or 1, but after 20 have been observed, the proportion should be somewhere 
		near <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>
	<p>Continue observing additional policies until about 1000 have been recorded. 
		By this time, the proportion of claims will have stabilised.</p>
	<p class="gray">(Hold down the button <strong>Find 10 values</strong> to speed up the simulation.)</p>
	<p>If we carried on infinitely long, the proportion would stabilise at a value 
		that we call the <strong>probability</strong> of there being a claim on a policy.</p>
