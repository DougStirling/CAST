<p class="heading">Descriptive and inferential statistics</p>
<p>The first three chapters of this e-book described statistical methods to summarise  data with tables, charts and summary statistics. These methods present the raw data  in a form that highlights important features that can then be interpreted in the context of the data. These methods are collectively called <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>.</p>
<p> Later chapters are concerned with a different collection of methods called <strong>inferential statistics</strong>. Inferential statistics is concerned with drawing conclusions about populations based on information derived from samples.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Life of light bulbs</dt>
	<dd>If a sample taken from a batch of light bulbs has an average life of 265 hours, what can we conclude about the average life for all bulbs in the batch? An estimate of the unknown average is 265 hours, but how certain are we of that estimate, and what is its accuracy?</dd>
	<dt>Errors in contract documents</dt>
	<dd>In sample of contract documents produced by staff in an office, 8% are found to have errors. Does this mean that 8% of all documents produced in this office has errors? If we accept that estimate as the best available, we cannot be certain that it is accurate. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Both of these examples use information from a sample of items (light bulbs or documents) to estimate characteristics about a larger population from which the sample was selected (whole batch of light bulbs or all contract documents produced in the office). The randomness of sampling means that there is <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('popSamp3')">uncertainty about these estimates</a>.</p>
<p>Before trying to answer the questions about the accuracy of estimates, we need to spend some time on the concepts and measurement of uncertainty. We  use the term <strong>probability</strong> when talking about uncertainty and chance.</p>
<p class="heading">Definitions of probability</p>
<p>The concept of a probability is closely related to that of a proportion.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Rolled die showing '6'</dt>
	<dd>The probability that a rolled die lands with its 6-face up is  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> since this is the proportion of faces that are 6.</dd>
	<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
	<dt>Outstanding invoices</dt>
	<dd>A company has 56 outstanding invoices for delivered goods. If 16 of these are older than one month, the probability that a randomly selected outstanding invoice is older than one month is <sup>16</sup>/<sub>56</sub>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In many applications however, probabilities cannot be defined in  such a simple way. The following two pages describe different ways to define probabilities and obtain numerical values for them.</p>
