<p class="heading">Problems with residuals as indicators of outliers</p>
<p>All data points pull the least squares line towards themselves &mdash; the line
is positioned to minimise the sum of squares of the residuals</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="bold black">minimise</span>  &nbsp; <img class="gif" src="../../en/regnProblem/images/minResidSsq.gif" width="37" height="20"></p>
<p>Large residuals pull very strongly on the line since they are <strong>squared</strong> in
the least squares criterion. As a result,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Outliers will strongly pull the least squares line towards themselves,
making their residuals smaller than you might otherwise expect.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Leverage</p>
<p>If an outlier corresponds to an <em>x</em>-value near its mean, it usually
will have a large residual,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../en/regnProblem/images/s_outlier.gif" width="553" height="321"></p>
<p>However if the outlier occurs at an extreme <em>x</em>-value, it has a stronger
influence on the position of the least squares line than the other data points.
Such points are called <strong>high leverage</strong> points and pull the least
squares line strongly towards them. Outliers that are high leverage points may
therefore result in residuals that do not stand out from the other residuals.</p>
