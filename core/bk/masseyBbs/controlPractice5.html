<p class="heading">Only act on special cause variation</p>
  <p>One of the principles behind the use of control charts is that:</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>Management should only intervene in a process if it is out of control, i.e. if it is subject to special cause variation.</p>
</div></div>
  <p>It has been found that the majority of problems in process management occur as a result of changes introduced by management in response to <strong>perceived</strong> variation. In other words, managers have a tendency to “meddle” or “tinker” with a process that is merely exhibiting its inherent (i.e. common cause) variation.</p>
  <p class="heading">Red bead experiment</p>
  <p>Deming illustrated this tendency to fiddle with a stable process by devising a famous experiment known as the <strong>red bead experiment</strong>. Briefly, the experiment consisted of mixing together a large number of red and white beads in a barrel or large jar. Volunteers representing workers were asked to produce as many white beads as possible by shovelling out a fixed number of beads using a paddle with circular indentations (so that each draw produced exactly the same number of beads).</p>
  <p>Of course the number of red beads in each draw is a binomial random variable with the same values of <em>n</em> and <em>p</em> (common cause variation). After each draw the beads are examined, and the workers with the smallest number of red beads are praised or given salary raises, while those workers with the largest number of red beads are reprimanded or fired. Of course the next set of draws produces a different set of results, and so the manager gets angry because some of his “good” workers have got worse, and so he starts rewarding or punishing again etc etc.</p>
  <p>Deming made the point that managers should not meddle with a stable process but rather listen more to the workers who are in a much better position to suggest improvements to the process.</p>
  <p>You can find out more about the red bead experiment on the web, e.g.</p>
