<p class="heading">Are the two population means equal?</p>
<p>Testing whether the two underlying population means are equal is done by assessing whether the difference between the sample means is more than could be expected by chance.</p>

<p>As with all other hypothesis tests, a p-value near zero gives evidence that 
the null hypothesis does not hold &mdash; evidence of a difference between the group 
means. </p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>The p-value is the probability of getting sample 
means as different as those observed if the two groups really had the same population 
means.</strong></p>

<p class="heading">Properties of p-values</p>

<p>It is important to understand that a statistical hypothesis test cannot provide 
a definitive answer about whether two groups have different means. The randomness 
of sample data means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>p-values are also random quantities, and</li>
<li>there is some chance of us being misled by an 'unlucky' sample. </li>
</ul>
