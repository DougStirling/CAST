<p class="heading">Data?</p>

  <p>When non-statisticians think of statistics, the first thing that usually 
		comes to mind is data. Social acquaintances are likely to expect a statistician 
		to be an expert on unemployment rates, foreign exchange rates, crime rates, 
		and other economic and social indicators. Although a statistician may have 
		had input into how these data were collected, the average statistician is 
		no more likely to know their values than anyone else in the population.</p>
	<p>Large amounts of data are routinely collected and published. Most libraries 
		have reference sections with shelves of information published by government 
		departments and industrial groups &mdash; we often wonder why so much effort was 
		expended collecting and publishing so much data!</p>
	<p>After completing an introductory statistics course, most students realise 
		that statistical analysis is also applied to smaller data sets such as these that are collected 
		in business. Modern textbooks 
		are full of such data.</p>

<p class="heading">Statistical methods?</p>
	<p>Data are the basic commodity of the statistics. Without data, there is no 
		information on which to reach conclusions or base decisions. However the information 
		in data is often not immediately obvious, especially in large data sets.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data contain information.<br><strong>The purpose of statistics is to extract information from data.</strong></p>
</div></div>
	
  <p>Large data sets must be summarised before patterns and relationships can 
    be seen &mdash; there is usually too much noise in the raw data to see the information 
    that they contain. Statistical analyses use graphical and numerical methods 
    to highlight important features of the data.</p>
		
	<p>In smaller data sets, it is less important to summarise the data &mdash; the problem 
		is usually that there is not enough information to get a clear answer to questions 
		of importance. Statistical methods are needed to describe precision and to 
		ensure that the highest precision is obtained.</p>

  <p class="heading">Context is most important</p>

  <p>Many introductory statistics courses focus on the toolkit of statistical 
		methods that is used to extract information from large and small data sets. 
		Although it is important to thoroughly understand these statistical methods, 
		<strong>users</strong> of statistics are generally interested in questions 
		in their own subject area.</p>
<ul>
		<li>An investment analysis wonders how much airline share prices fall in response 
			to increases in crude oil prices.</li>
		<li>A bakery manager wants to monitor whether the quality of bread is being 
			maintained.</li>
		<li>A personnel manager is interested in whether staff satisfaction in an 
			office is improved by provision of a coffee machine.</li>
		<li>An engineer needs to adjust the inputs to an industrial process to get 
			optimum purity in the output.</li>
		<li>The organiser of an outdoor 3-day agricultural show wants to know the 
			chance of rain disrupting the event if it is held in June. In July? In August?</li>
		<li>The president of a teachers' trade union asks whether there is an increase 
			in the number of days that members are taking off work due to stress.</li>
		<li>Computer support staff in a large company want to know whether there are 
			fewer computer crashes after a system upgrade is installed.</li>
		<li>A real estate agent wonders whether house prices are increasing in a certain 
			area.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Statistical methods are used to extract information from data.<br>
However <strong>the methods themselves are not the goal</strong>.</p>
</div></div>
<p><strong>The aim of statistics is to supply useful information to people whose 
		main area of expertise is <span class="red">not</span> statistics.</strong> 
	These people are not interested directly in either data or statistical methods.	In	a business setting, data are collected in order to throw light on some question of importance to the business manager. Typically statistics will help you make decisions based on evidence. Statistical methods are only useful if they can extract information from data 
	to help answer discipline-specific questions. The underlying context is therefore 
the most important aspect of any statistical analysis. </p>
	<p><strong>Nobody collects data unless they are interested in the context and 
		in what the data might tell them.</strong> Many business students  therefore only appreciate the subject long after they 
		have completed their <em><strong>Statistics for Business</strong></em> course &mdash; when their job requires 
		answers that must be based on data.</p>
	<p class="heading">Context in CAST</p>
	<p>It is easy to miss the importance of statistics if you have no personal interest 
		in the context of the data sets that you use. Even though this statistics course is targeted at learners from a business background, 
		there is rarely a personal interest in the context of all the specific data sets 
		used in the course. The best we can do is to expose you to a wide range of 
		data and contexts and assure you that the same statistical methods will be 
		equally useful for analysing data of real interest to you later.</p>
