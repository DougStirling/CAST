<p class="heading">Control chart principles</p>
<p>Since measurements are rarely more than 3 standard deviations from the
mean, we usually define the control limits  to be:</p>
<p class="eqn">(mean measurement)&nbsp; ± &nbsp; 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;sd (measurement)</p>
<p>where the mean and standard deviation are obtained when the process is in control.
Future measurements outside the control limits are unlikely if the process remains
in control.</p>
<p class="heading">Control charts based on samples</p>
<p>In practice, control charts are rarely based on individual measurements from a
process. Instead, a small <strong>sample</strong> of measurements is usually recorded
at each time. By creating separate control charts for the sample means and sample
ranges, we can separately assess the process mean and its variability since quality
depends on both maintaining a consistent mean and low variability.</p>

<p>Control charts for sample means and ranges are constructed in a similar way to
run charts but the details differ.</p>
