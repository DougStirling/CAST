<p>When numerical or categorical data are collected from two groups of individuals, 
we are usually interested in testing whether there is any difference between the 
groups and, if there is a difference, describing it.</p>
<p>If there are two groups, we usually perform hypothesis tests about 
the difference between the group means or proportions.</p>
<p>Tests based on contingency tables are also described.</p>
