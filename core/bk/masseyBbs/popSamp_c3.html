<p class=heading>Parameters and statistics</p>

  <p>A random sample is often used to obtain information about a population when we cannot measure all population values. It is important to distinguish between a characteristic of the population, such as its mean or a proportion, and the corresponding characteristic from the sample.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<ul>
  		<li>A population characteristic is called a <span class="red">parameter</span>.</li>
  		<li>A sample characteristic  is called a <span class="red">statistic</span>.</li>
 		</ul>
	</div></div>
<p class=heading>Estimating means and proportions</p>
	<p>A random sample is often selected from a population in order to estimate some particular numerical summary of it. 
		The population characteristic of interest might be...</p>
  <ul>
  	
	<li>The mean of some variable (e.g. the mean income of people or the mean diameter 
of manufactured ball bearings).</li>
    
<li>The proportion in some category (e.g. the proportion of students aged over 
30 or the proportion of companies with over 20 employees).</li>
</ul>

  <p>Although we do not know the value of the population mean or proportion,  the corresponding sample statistic can be used to <strong>estimate</strong> it. Estimation will be considered 
    in greater depth in later chapters, but we note here that the sample mean 
  or proportion is usually different from the target population mean or proportion.</p>
  <p class=heading>Sampling error</p>
  <p>The difference between an estimate and the value being estimated is called 
    its <strong>sampling error</strong>. </p>

<div class="boxed">
    <p>When a population characteristic is estimated from a sample, there 
      is usually a sampling error.</p>

difference from the true mean (the sampling error).</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">Effect of sample size on sampling error</p>

<p>The larger the sample size, the smaller the sampling error. However when the 
population is large, sampling a small proportion of the population may still give 
accurate estimates. </p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Sampling error depends much more strongly on the sample size than 
on the proportion of the population that is sampled.</p>
</div></div>


<p>For example, a sample of 10 from a population of 10,000 people will estimate 
the proportion of males almost as accurately as a sample of size 10 from a population 
of 100.</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The cost savings from using a sample instead of a full census can 
be huge.</p>

 <p class="heading">Shelving for large library books</p>

<p>The manager of a library intends to purchase new shelving for its collection 
and wonders what proportion of its books will fit on shelves with 'standard' spacing. 
Since there are over one million books in the library, it is infeasible to classify 
<strong>all</strong> books as normal or outsize, so the decision on shelving must 
be made from a sample of books.</p>
<p>To investigate how many books must be sampled, we will sample from a population 
of 1,000,000 books in which 20% are outsize.</p>
<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="500" height="190">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="designProg.SamplingTableApplet">
<param name="catVarName" value="Book size">
<param name="catValues" value="200000@0 800000@1">
<param name="catLabels" value="Outsize Normal">
<param name="sampling" value="10 100 1000 10000 100000 9375476">
<param name="fontSize" value="big">
</applet>
</div>

<p>Initially we will take random samples of 1,000 books. Click <strong>Take sample</strong> 
a few times. The difference between the sample proportion of outsize books and 
the population proportion (0.200) is the sampling error. </p>

<p>Use the pop-up menu to investigate how the sample size affects the accuracy
of the estimate. You should observe that the sampling error is usually smaller when
the sample size is large.
</p>

<p>In practice, a sample size of 1000 books would give the library a sufficiently
accurate estimate of the proportion of outsize books. It is certainly hard to
imagine a situation where more than 1% of this population would need to be sampled!</p>
