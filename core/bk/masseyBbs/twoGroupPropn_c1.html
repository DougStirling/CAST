<p class="heading">Modelling two-group data</p>

<p>For data that consist of independent samples from two groups, we use a separate 
univariate model for each group.</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The data in each group are separately modelled as a random sample 
from a univariate distribution.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The details depend on the type of measurement from each group.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Numerical measurements</dt>
<dd>A numerical distribution (e.g. a normal distribution) is used to model each 
group. The earlier sections of this chapter described models of this form and 
related inference.</dd>
<dt>Categorical measurements</dt>
<dd>In each group, the data are assumed to be a random sample of categorical values 
from a population whose population proportions (probabilities) are usually unknown.</dd>
<dt>Categorical measurements with <span class="black">only two categories</span></dt>
<dd>In this section, we will consider a special case in which there are only two 
possible categories. To simplify the description, we arbitrarily call them 'success' and 'failure'.</dd>

<p class="heading">Are the two groups the same?</p>
  
<p>We are often interested in differences between two groups. The model for two-group 
'success/failure' data involves only two parameters, π<sub>1</sub> 
and π<sub>2</sub>, 
so we will assess the difference between the probabilities, π<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;π<sub>1</sub>. 
If this difference is zero, then both groups are the same.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The value of π<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;π<sub>1</sub> 
concisely describes any difference between the two groups.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In practice, the value of π<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;π<sub>1</sub> 
is unknown, but it can be estimated from sample data. The difference between the 
sample proportions, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, 
is an estimate. However <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>p</em><sub>1</sub> 
is a random quantity that varies from sample to sample, so its variability must 
be taken into account when interpreting its value.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Typical data sets</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a few data sets in which either 'success' or 'failure' 
is recorded from each individual in two groups.</p>

<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeImage('image', this)">
<option value="0" selected>Business ethics and gender</option>
<option value="1">Tractor driveline shield removal</option>
<option value="2">Binge drinking by students</option>
<option value="3">Pizza buying and price</option>
</select>
</form>

<p align="center"><img src="../../en/twoGroupPropn/images/ethics.gif" name="dataImage" width="514" height="336"></p>

<p>Each data set is summarised by a contingency table.</p>

<p>Note that the red questions do not refer to the specific individuals in the 
study. They ask about differences between the groups 'in general'.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>We are interested in the population difference π<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;π<sub>1</sub> rather than the sample difference <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>.</p>
</div></div>

<br>
</div>


<p class="heading">Inference</p>
<p>The difference between the sample proportions, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, gives a point estimate of π<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;π<sub>1</sub>. However this estimate is a random quantity &mdash; it varies from sample to sample &mdash; so it is important to understand its distribution. In particular, we need to know:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>How far from zero should <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>p</em><sub>1</sub> be in order for us to conclude that the population proportions differ (π<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;≠&nbsp;π<sub>1</sub>)?</div></div>


<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Simulation of sample-to-sample variability</p>
<p>The diagram below selects samples of size 100 from each of two categorical 
populations.</p>

<p>Initially the probability of a success in Group A is π<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.30, 
so we <strong>expect</strong> 30 successes and 70 failures from a sample of 100 
values. In Group B, π<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.40, 
so we expect 40 successes. The table above shows these expected counts and a random 
sample from the model.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to observe the variability of 
the sample counts of successes and failures. The sample proportions and their 
difference are shown on the right.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The difference, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, 
		varies from sample to sample and is often not equal to the population difference, 
		π<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;π<sub>1</sub>.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Finally, use the two sliders to adjust the values of the population probabilities, 
	π<sub>1</sub> and π<sub>2</sub>. 
	Observe that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>If π<sub>1</sub> and π<sub>2</sub> are the same, positive and negative values for <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>p<sub>1</sub></em> occur similar numbers of times &mdash; its distribution is centred on zero.</p>
