<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Categorical Data</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Frequency tables</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Frequency tables</h3>
<p>A frequency table holds all information about the distribution of a categorical variable.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Proportions and percentages</h3>
<p>The proportions or percentages of values are usually easier to interpret than the raw frequencies.</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Recognising frequency tables (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>In a frequency table, each 'individual' contributes 1 to exactly one table entry. Many published tables are not frequency tables.</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Changes to the categories (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>The information in a frequency table may be clearer if the categories are re-ordered, associated categories are combined, or if the table only describes a subset of the categories.</p>
<h3>2.1.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Proportions from tables</h3>
<p>This exercise displays frequency tables and asks you to find the proportion or percentage of values equal to, or not equal to, a particular categorical value.</p>
<h3>2.1.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Propns from ordered categories</h3>
<p>The exercise in this page is similar to the previous exercise but asks questions about values greater than, greater than or equal to, etc. a value.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Bar and pie charts</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Bar charts</h3>
<p>A bar chart displays the frequencies in a frequency table graphically.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Pareto diagrams</h3>
<p>For barcharts of categorical data whose categories have no natural ordering, it is often helpful to sort the categories into decreasing frequencies.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Chartjunk and misleading bar charts</h3>
<p>The temptation to embellish simple barcharts should be resisted. Some such 'artistic' embellishments are misleading.</p>
<h3>2.2.4 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts and pie charts</h3>
<p>These are alternatives to a bar chart for categorical data.</p>
<h3>2.2.5 &nbsp; Comparison of bar and pie charts</h3>
<p>Bar charts distinguish better the proportions in single categories. Pie charts are better for showing the proportion in a groups of categories.</p>
<h3>2.2.6 &nbsp; Chartjunk for pie charts</h3>
<p>Three-dimensional pie charts are often drawn. If a pie chart holds little information, it is better to draw it small than to enhance it in this way.</p>
<h3>2.2.7 &nbsp; Bar & pie charts for quantities (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>Bar and pie charts can be used to display any data where a total quantity is split into parts.</p>
<h3>2.2.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a bar chart</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will draw the bar chart corresponding to a frequency table.</p>
<h3>2.2.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Find proportion from bar chart</h3>
<p>This exercise shows bar charts for data sets with ordered categories, augmented with a graph of the cumulative frequencies. You are asked to find proportions and percentages from the diagram.</p>
<h3>2.2.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Pareto diagram</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will produce a Pareto diagram by reordering the bars of a bar chart, then find a proportion or percentage relating to the most important or least important categories.</p>
<h3>2.2.11 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a pie chart</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will draw the pie chart corresponding to a frequency table, using either the individual frequencies or the cumulative frequencies.</p>
<h3>2.2.12 &nbsp; Exercise: Match bar and pie charts</h3>
<p>Bar and pie charts display the same information in different ways. This exercise displays bar and pie charts for four data sets and asks you to match them.</p>
<h3>2.2.13 &nbsp; Exercise: Proportions from pie chart</h3>
<p>This exercise displays the pie chart for either an ordinal categorical variable or a categorical variable in which the categories have been arranged in decreasing order of their frequencies. You are asked to estimate the percentage in some adjacent categories 'by eye' from the pie chart.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; Contingency tables</h3>
<p>Categorical data collected from different groups can be shown in a contingency table. It contains a simple frequency table for each group.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Contingency table examples</h3>
<p>Contingency tables sometimes arise from experiments. Data collected from surveys are often presented in contingency tables.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Bar charts using proportions</h3>
<p>It is easier to compare groups if bar charts are drawn from the proportions within each group rather than the frequencies.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>Stacking the bars in each bar chart makes it easier to compare groups. Stacked bar charts are particularly effective for ordinal categorical data.</p>
<h3>2.3.5 &nbsp; Two special cases (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>When the variable has only two categories, stacked bar charts can be simplified. An example is also given where the grouping forms a time series.</p>
<h3>2.3.6 &nbsp; Bivariate categorical data</h3>
<p>Contingency tables are also used to summarise data sets in which two different categorical measuements are made from each individual. The data can be presented graphically by using one variable to split the individuals into groups.</p>
<h3>2.3.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Create a contingency table</h3>
<p>This exercise presents a list of values of two categorical variables; you must generate a contingency table summarising the data.</p>
<h2>2.4 &nbsp; Presenting data in tables</h2>
<h3>2.4.1 &nbsp; Gridlines and white space</h3>
<p>Never use gridlines to box all values in a table. In large multi-column tables, reading across rows is easier with occasional hairlines of light shading, but otherwise consider using white space to separate associated groups of rows or columns.</p>
<h3>2.4.2 &nbsp; Layout and annotation</h3>
<p>Use white space to group related rows and columns. Rearranging rows or columns may bring values that should be compared closer. Summarise and interpret in the body of a report but do not simply repeat values.</p>
<h3>2.4.3 &nbsp; Significant digits and data noise</h3>
<p>The meaningful information is 'signal'. Information that does not help understanding of the data is 'noise'. Noise includes data noise and unnecessary embellishments to the table. Decreasing the significant digits displayed often decreases data noise.</p>
<h3>2.4.4 &nbsp; Meaningful variables</h3>
<p>Showing proportions in a multi-column table instead of frequencies makes it easier to compare groups. Ratios of variables can be easier to interpret than their raw values.</p>
<h3>2.4.5 &nbsp; Swapping rows and columns</h3>
<p>It is easier to compare values down rows than across columns. Interchanging the rows and columns of a table can make it easier to make comparisons.</p>
<h3>2.4.6 &nbsp; Reordering rows</h3>
<p>Rearranging the rows (or columns) may make the information in large tables stand out better.</p>
<h3>2.4.7 &nbsp; Example</h3>
<p>An example shows a published table whose presentation can be improved in many ways.</p>
