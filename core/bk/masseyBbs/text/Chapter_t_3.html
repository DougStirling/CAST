<h1>Chapter 3 &nbsp; Numerical Data</h1>
<h2>3.1 &nbsp; Tables and graphs for numbers</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 &nbsp; Analysing variation</h3>
<p>Meaningful information can be obtained from variation in the values of a variable.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>Stem and leaf plots shows each value as a digit in a display whose shape gives an overall impression of the distribution of values.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h3>
<p>To increase the flexibility of the display, each stem may be repeated either 2 or 5 times, increasing the number of classes in the basic stem and leaf plot by a factor of 2 or 5.</p>
<h3>3.1.4 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>Stem and leaf plots are very easy to draw by hand.</p>
<h3>3.1.5 &nbsp; Dot plots</h3>
<p>Stacked dot plots are closely related to stem and leaf plots but use crosses rather then leaf digits. Jittered dot plots draw crosses at their exact position along an axis but randomly move them perpendicularly to separate them.</p>
<h3>3.1.6 &nbsp; Density of values</h3>
<p>The heights of the stacks of leaves in a stem and leaf plot or crosses in a dot plot describe the density of values.</p>
<h3>3.1.7 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h3>
<p>In a simple histogram, the height of the rectangle above each class on the axis equals the number of values in the class — the class frequency.</p>
<h3>3.1.8 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h3>
<p>Class width and start-point should be chosen to make the histogram as smooth as possible — neither too blocky nor too jagged.</p>
<h3>3.1.9 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h3>
<p>The shape of a histogram can be very dependent on the choice of classes if the data set is small; beware over-interpreting its shape. Stacked dot plots are a better display of small data sets.</p>
<h3>3.1.10 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h3>
<p>In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</p>
<h3>3.1.11 &nbsp; Drawing histograms by hand (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>Histograms are based on frequency tables. Class boundaries should avoid possible data values.</p>
<h3>3.1.12 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>If a histogram has varying class widths, the vertical axis must be 'density'. The histogram shape would be misleading if frequency or relative frequency was used for the vertical axis.</p>
<h3>3.1.13 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a stem and leaf plot</h3>
<p>In the two exercises on this page, you will drag leaves to form stem and leaf plots from a list of values. The second exercise creates stem and leaf plots with split stems. </p>
<h3>3.1.14 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a histogram</h3>
<p>In this page, you will draw histograms of different data sets.</p>
<h3>3.1.15 &nbsp; Exercise: Histogram areas and proportions</h3>
<p>The two exercises in this page ask you to use the shape of a histogram to find the proportion of values in a given range. The first exercise shows the number of values in each class, but the second requires the histogram area to be estimated 'by eye'.</p>
<h2>3.2 &nbsp; Understanding distributions</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>Does the data contain any outliers — values that are atypically large or small? The extreme values in a skew distribution are often mistaken for outliers.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>Does the data split into separate clusters — ranges of values with high density separated by ranges with low density? Clusters may correspond to different groups of individuals.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h3>
<p>The distribution gives information about a typical value round which the data are spread (the distribution's location or centre) and the variability of the values (the spread of the distribution).</p>
<h3>3.2.4 &nbsp; Dangers of overinterpretation</h3>
<p>There is a risk of over-interpreting patterns in small data sets.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Information from distributions</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will interpret what distributions with symmetry, skewness, clusters or outliers tell you about the data.</p>
<h2>3.3 &nbsp; Describing centre and spread</h2>
<h3>3.3.1 &nbsp; Centre and spread</h3>
<p>The centre of a distribution is a 'typical value'. The spread describes how far the values are from the centre.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 &nbsp; Summaries of centre</h3>
<p>The median and mean are alternative measures of the centre of a distribution.</p>
<h3>3.3.3 &nbsp; Properties of median and mean</h3>
<p>When a data set is not symmetric, the mean and median may differ substantially.</p>
<h3>3.3.4 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h3>
<p>The standard deviation is the most commonly used numerical summary of the spread of values in a data set.</p>
<h3>3.3.5 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb is useful for understanding the numerical value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>3.3.6 &nbsp; Understanding means and st devns</h3>
<p>It is possible to roughly guess the mean and standard deviation from a histogram and roughly sketch a symmetric histogram matching any given mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>3.3.7 &nbsp; Warnings about mean and standard devn</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation cannot give any indication of the existance of outliers, skewness or clusters. A stem and leaf plot or histogram should be examined before reporting these numerical summaries.</p>
<h3>3.3.8 &nbsp; Population parameters</h3>
<p>The above summaries of centre and spread are used to describe sample data. The corresponding population summaries are called parameters and different symbols are used to refer to them.</p>
<h3>3.3.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Ideas of centre and spread</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you should summarise the difference between two distributions in terms of their different centres and spreads.</p>
<h3>3.3.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Mean and median</h3>
<p>An exercise requests estimates of the mean and median from different skew and symmetric stacked dot plots.</p>
<h3>3.3.11 &nbsp; Exercise: Standard deviation from graph</h3>
<p>The first exercise asks for a rough 'guess' at the standard deviation of data sets from a stacked dot plot. The second exercise is similar but displays the data as a histogram or box plot.</p>
<h3>3.3.12 &nbsp; Exercise: Standard deviation from general knowledge</h3>
<p>In this exercise, general knowledge about the type of measurement is enough to roughly guess the value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>3.3.13 &nbsp; Exercise: Rough graph from mean and st devn</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation of a data set should give you a good idea of the likely distribution of values. The first exercise in this page asks you to sketch a stacked dot plot to match a given mean and standard deviation. In the second, a histogram should be drawn.</p>
<h2>3.4 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 &nbsp; Comparing dot and stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>If the values come from 2 or more groups of individuals, dot plots and stem and leaf plots can be modified to show this extra information.</p>
<h3>3.4.2 &nbsp; Comparing histograms</h3>
<p>The vertical axis should be relative frequency, not frequency, when comparing two groups with histograms. Population pyramids are often used to compare age distributions.</p>
<h3>3.4.3 &nbsp; Frequency polygons</h3>
<p>Frequency polygons are closely related to histograms but give a less 'blocky' display of density. Different groups can be compared more easily with them.</p>
<h3>3.4.4 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h3>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain detailed information that is distracting when two or more data sets are being compared.</p>
<h3>3.4.5 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h3>
<p>The median and quartiles split a batch of values into four equal-sized sets of values. A box plot is a graphical display of the median, quartiles and extremes.</p>
<h3>3.4.6 &nbsp; Interpreting a box plot's shape</h3>
<p>A box plot clearly shows the centre, spread and skewness of a data set. It splits the corresponding histogram into 4 approximately equal areas.</p>
<h3>3.4.7 &nbsp; Displaying outliers (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>The basic box plot is often modified to display outliers as separate crosses.</p>
<h3>3.4.8 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>Box plots cannot show clusters, so should not be used to summarise data with clusters.</p>
<h3>3.4.9 &nbsp; Comparison of groups</h3>
<p>Box plots are particularly effective for displaying differences between several groups of values.</p>
<h3>3.4.10 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h3>
<p>Box plots are relatively stable, and contain less 'noise' than other displays. They can concisely describe differences between even small groups.</p>
<h3>3.4.11 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a box plot</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page involve drawing box plots from sorted lists of values. For the second (optional) exercise, 'outliers' must be separately identified.</p>
<h3>3.4.12 &nbsp; Exercise: Shape of a box plot</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page involve matching the shape of box plots to the corresponding dot plots.</p>
<h2>3.5 &nbsp; Two numerical variables</h2>
<h3>3.5.1 &nbsp; Bivariate data sets</h3>
<p>Many data sets contain two or more measurements from each individual. Even when the main interest is in one variable, the others can help to understand its distribution.</p>
<h3>3.5.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h3>
<p>The main display that shows the relationship between two variables is a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>3.5.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h3>
<p>Univariate displays don't show relationships between variables.</p>
<h3>3.5.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>A scatterplot of two variables can be enhanced with box plots or histograms on the margins of a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>3.5.5 &nbsp; Strength of a relationship</h3>
<p>The main feature of interest in a scatterplot is the strength of the relationship between the two variables.</p>
<h3>3.5.6 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>An extreme value of one or both of the variables is an outlier. An unusual combination of values is also called an outlier.</p>
<h3>3.5.7 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>If the crosses on a scatterplot separate into clusters, different groups of individuals are suggested.</p>
<h3>3.5.8 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h3>
<p>In small data sets, there may be considerable variability, so patterns should be strongly evident before they are reported.</p>
<h3>3.5.9 &nbsp; Explanatory and response variables</h3>
<p>One variable can often be classified as an explanatory variable that either causally affects the reponse variable, or is useful for predicting its value.</p>
<h3>3.5.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Draw a scatterplot</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will complete a scatterplot by dragging the crosses for the last two observations.</p>
<h3>3.5.11 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret a scatterplot</h3>
<p>The exercises in this page expect you to interpret scatterplots in terms of the relationship between the variables, clusters and outliers. In the first exercise, the interpretation is in an application context, whereas in the second the interpretation is in generic terms.</p>
<h2>3.6 &nbsp; Correlation</h2>
<h3>3.6.1 &nbsp; Units for X and Y</h3>
<p>A numerical description of the strength of a relationship should not be affected by rescaling the variables.</p>
<h3>3.6.2 &nbsp; Units-free variables (z-scores)</h3>
<p>Standardising a variable gives z-scores that do not depend on the units of the original variable. (The correlation coefficient will be defined in terms of z-scores for X and Y.)</p>
<h3>3.6.3 &nbsp; Correlation coefficient</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient summarises the strength of the relationship between X and Y. It is +1 when the scatterplot crosses are on a straight line with positive slope, -1 when on a line with negative slope, and zero when X and Y are unrelated.</p>
<h3>3.6.4 &nbsp; Scatterplots and the value of r</h3>
<p>You should be able to estimate the value of r from looking at a scatterplot and imagine a scatter of crosses corresponding to any value of r.</p>
<h3>3.6.5 &nbsp; Nonlinear relationships</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient is only a good measure of the strength of a relationship if the points in a scatterplot are scattered round a straight line, not a curve.</p>
<h3>3.6.6 &nbsp; R does not tell the whole story</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient cannot identify curvature, outliers or clusters and can be misleading if these features are present. A scatterplot must always be examined too.</p>
<h3>3.6.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Estimate r by eye</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will make a rough estimate of correlation coefficient by eye from a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>3.6.8 &nbsp; Exercise: r for non-standard data</h3>
<p>This exercise presents four scatterplots (one elliptical, one with an outlier, one with two clusters and one with curvature) and asks for these to be matched with the corresponding values of r.</p>
