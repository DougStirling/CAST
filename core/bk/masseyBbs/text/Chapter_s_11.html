<h1 class="chapterName">Chapter 11 &nbsp; Control Charts</h1>
<h1 class="sectionName">11.1 &nbsp; Total quality management</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">11.1.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h2>

<p class="heading">Origins of TQM</p>
<p>Total Quality Management (or TQM for short) is an approach to management of organisations
and processes. The aim is to continuously improve the quality of products and
services through statistical methods of monitoring and improving.</p>
<p>The Six Sigma programme is a popular approach to TQM.</p>
<p class="heading">Importance of quality</p>
<p>The quality of a product or service depends on whether it satisfies the needs
of its consumers. Quality must always be a major focus.</p>
<p> This chapter  focuses on the statistical aspects of quality management,
and in particular on the concept of statistical quality control through control
charts.</p>


<h2 class="pageName">11.1.2 &nbsp; The statistical process</h2>

<p class="heading">Continuous quality improvement</p>
	<p>Statistical analysis is an important part of long-term <strong>monitoring</strong> and <strong>improvement</strong> of
the performance of many types of system. This process is often called <strong>continuous
quality improvement</strong>.</p>
<p>The statistical part of the process again involves a feedback cycle of data collection and analysis, aimed at improving aspects of the system.
</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/pdca.gif" width="463" height="265"></p>
	<p>The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle is most often used in commerce and industry, but
can also be used to 'improve'  many biological and other systems.</p>

	


<h2 class="pageName">11.1.3 &nbsp; Finding the cause of problems</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Finding the <span class="red">cause</span> of problems</p>
	<p>Control charts (and other collected data) may indicate problems with a system. 
		However, after detection of a problem, its <strong>cause</strong> must be 
		identified in order to rectify it. This is usually a non-trivial exercise 
		and the following tools often help.</p>
<p class="heading">Brainstorming</p>
	<p>In a <strong>brainstorming</strong> session, all team 
		members contribute short phrases that are written on either a large sheet of paper 
		or individual scraps of paper (post-it notes are good). The points should be written 
		down without discussion or editing, and all team members should be encouraged 
		to contribute.</p>
	<p>Once these ideas have been written down, they must be structured or grouped 
		in some way.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cause-and-effect diagrams</p>
	<p>After possible causes for a problem have been contributed in a brainstorming 
		session, they can be structured in a <strong>cause-and-effect</strong> diagram (also called  a <strong>fishbone</strong> diagram).</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/controlChart/images/fishbone4.gif" width="484" height="377" class="summaryPict"></p>
<p>This structuring of possible causes helps to focus attention on the most likely 
		causes and on ones that may be altered in the 'Do' step in the Plan-Do-Check-Act 
		cycle.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">11.2 &nbsp; Control chart basics</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">11.2.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h2>

<p class="heading">Detecting problems</p>
<p>Problems in a process are usually detected by collecting and analysing <strong>data</strong> about
the performance of the system.  <strong>Control charts</strong> are a particularly
useful way to monitor processes and detect problems before they get too out of hand. </p>


<h2 class="pageName">11.2.2 &nbsp; Run charts</h2>

<p class=heading>Inherent variability</p>
	<p>A certain level of variability in any process is unavoidable. We say that this 
		'acceptable' level of variability is a result of <strong>common causes</strong> (or <strong>random causes</strong>) and if it is the only source of variability, 
		the process is said to be <strong>in control</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Systematic changes</p>
	<p>Our aim is to detect changes to the output that are <strong>not</strong> the 
		result of common causes. Such systematic changes are said to be the result of <strong>special causes</strong> (or <strong>assignable causes</strong>) and 
		could result in... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>movement in the process mean (either abruptly or steadily over time),</li>
		<li>single outliers, or</li>
		<li>changes to the process variability</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Systematic changes usually indicate problems with the quality of the output and the process is said to be <strong>out of control</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Run chart</p>
	<p>A <strong>control chart</strong> plots   measurements describing the process in time order &mdash; a type of time series plot. We hope to use it to quickly detect problems and adjust the process to maintain quality. If a single value is recorded at each time, the control chart is called a <strong>run chart</strong>. (Other control charts plot sample means and ranges.)</p>
<p>The challenge is to detect systematic 
		changes in the control chart (due to special causes) over the background level of 
		variability (due to common causes).</p>
	<p>In the example below, the manager has determined that an output measurement should 'almost always' be between 2,000 and 2,080 with variability in this range considered to be due to common causes. Two out of the last four values were above the upper limit, suggesting a problem with the process that should be investigated and fixed.</p>
	<p class="eqn">																										<img src="../../../en/controlChart/images/s_outliers.gif" width="553" height="302"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">11.2.3 &nbsp; Control limits</h2>

<p class="heading">Control limits</p>
	<p>The simplest rule suggesting a special cause is any value that is outside
		two <strong>control limits</strong>. Values outside the control limits suggest
that the process is <strong>out of control</strong> &mdash;
		they <strong>trigger</strong> an examination of the process for a special cause. </p>
	<p>Control limits are usually based on the mean and standard deviation of the 
		process when it is in control. The 70-95-100 rule of thumb states that in many 
		distributions, </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Approximately two thirds of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
		<li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
		<li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/controlChart/images/bands.gif" width="578" height="264"></p>
	<p>By setting the upper and lower control limits to be 3 standard deviations
		on either side of the process mean, we avoid many 'false alarms' when the process is
		in control. This is important since values outside the control limits would trigger an examination of the 
		production process &mdash; possibly a costly exercise.</p>
	<p class="heading">Shape of the distribution</p>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb is most accurate for reasonably symmetric, bell-shaped distributions, though values more than 3 standard deviations from the mean are rare for all distributions. However these control limits should be avoided for very skew distributions &mdash; consider transforming  the data before producing 
	a run chart.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">11.2.4 &nbsp; Other signals of being out-of-control</h2>

<p class="heading">Additional triggers for an out-of-control process </p>
	<p>The most commonly used indication of a process being out-of-control is a  
		value outside the upper and lower control limits (more than three standard deviations 
		away from the centre line). This is sensitive to changes to the process mean 
		or increases in the process variability. </p>
	<p>Additional triggers have been proposed that are also sensitive to systematic
		changes in a process. These are all based
		on successive values within 1, 2 or 3 standard deviations from the centre (Zones C, B or A).	</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/controlChart/images/s_triggers.gif" width="550" height="589"></p>
<p>Only the first three of these need be remembered in this course.</p>


<h2 class="pageName">11.2.5 &nbsp; False alarms</h2>

<p class="heading">False alarms </p>
	<p>Although the individual patterns that we use as triggers occur rarely in a process
		that is in control, they do occur occasionally. Indeed, the proportion of values
		from a stable process that triggers each of the
		criteria is typically about 1 in 200, so if all five criteria are used, a reasonable
		number of <strong>false alarms</strong> will occur. </p>
	<p>Clearly a single exceptional value is not conclusive proof that the process is
out of control. However it is appropriate to examine carefully the operation of the process
to look for an assignable cause for this value (and adjust the process if such a cause
is discovered).
And a <strong>series</strong> of such values does indicate that the process is out of control. </p>





<h2 class="pageName">11.2.6 &nbsp; Examples of run charts</h2>

<p class="heading">Obtaining control limits</p>
	<p>It is important to evaluate control limits from the mean and standard
		deviation of values from the process <strong>when it is in control</strong>.
		The process should be monitored carefully (to avoid special causes) for this training period. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/controlChart/images/s_runExample.gif" width="555" height="515"></p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">11.3 &nbsp; Control charts in practice</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">11.3.1 &nbsp; Control charts based on samples</h2>

<p class="heading">Control chart principles</p>
<p>Since measurements are rarely more than 3 standard deviations from the
mean, we usually define the control limits  to be:</p>
<p class="eqn">(mean measurement)&nbsp; ± &nbsp; 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;sd (measurement)</p>
<p>where the mean and standard deviation are obtained when the process is in control.
Future measurements outside the control limits are unlikely if the process remains
in control.</p>
<p class="heading">Control charts based on samples</p>
<p>In practice, control charts are rarely based on individual measurements from a
process. Instead, a small <strong>sample</strong> of measurements is usually recorded
at each time. By creating separate control charts for the sample means and sample
ranges, we can separately assess the process mean and its variability since quality
depends on both maintaining a consistent mean and low variability.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Control charts for sample means and ranges are constructed in a similar way to
run charts but the details differ.</p>
</div></div>


<h2 class="pageName">11.3.2 &nbsp; Control charts for means</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Control chart for means</p>
<p>We first consider detection of whether the <strong>mean output level of a process</strong> is
changing. Each sample  of <em>n</em> values has a mean whose standard deviation is
</p>
<div class="centred">
	<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
		<tr>

</div>
<p>If we knew  µ and  σ, the appropritate control limits would therefore be:</p>
<p class=eqn><img src="../images/controlLimitTheory.gif" width="70" height="31" alt="xBar +- 3s/root(n)"></p>
<p>Note that these control limits are much narrower than those that would be used
for individual values, </p>
<p class=eqn><img src="../images/controlLimitTheory2.gif" width="57" height="15" alt="xBar +- 3s"></p>
<p class=heading>Training data</p>
<p>Since neither µ nor σ are usually known, the control limits
must  be estimated from training samples in which great care is taken to
avoid special causes. It would be reasonable to replace µ and σ in the control limits
with the mean and standard deviation of the training data, but in practice, the
control limits are usually based on the mean and<strong> <span class="black">range</span></strong> of
the <em>k</em> training samples as follows:</p>
<p class=eqn><img src="../images/meanLimits.gif" width="148" height="51" alt="xBar +- 3s"></p>
<p>where <img src="../images/xBarBar.gif" alt="x-bar-bar" width="16" height="18" align="baseline">is
the average of the <em>k </em>training sample means, and <img src="../images/rBar.gif" alt="r-bar" width="12" height="15" align="baseline"> is
average of their ranges,</p>
<p class=eqn><img src="../images/r_x_bar_defn.gif" width="209" height="61" alt="xBar +- 3s"></p>
<p>The constant, <em>A</em><sub>2</sub>,
can be found from the following table provided the sample size, <em>n</em>, is no
more than 10.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">11.3.3 &nbsp; Control charts for ranges</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Detecting changes to process variability</p>
<p>A control chart of sample means is used to detect shifts in the 'centre' of a
process. In a similar way, a control chart of sample <strong>ranges</strong> is used to
assess whether the process <strong>variability</strong> has
changed.</p>
<p class="heading">Control chart for range</p>
<p>Control charts for ranges are constructed and interpreted in a similar way to
control charts for means &mdash; there is very little chance of observations breaching
the control limits if the process is in control &mdash; but the control limits are obtained
in a different way.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">11.3.4 &nbsp; Control charts for proportions</h2>

<p class="heading">Attributes and defects</p>
<p>A <strong>p-chart</strong> is used to monitor the proportion of process output
that has a certain attribute, such as the proportion of items with defects.</p>
<p>If  <em>x</em> items in a sample of size <em>n</em> have the attribute, then <em>x</em> has
a binomial distribution and the
sample proportion<em> p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em><sup>x</sup></em>/<em><sub>n</sub></em> has
mean and standard deviation:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../images/propnMeanSd.gif" width="230" height="42"></p>
<p>where π is the population proportion.</p>
<p class="heading">Control limits</p>
<p>As in other control charts, the control limits are given by the mean ± three standard
deviations,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../images/propnPlusMinus.gif" width="134" height="44"></p>
<p>Since π is unknown, it is estimated from a training period in which the process
is in control. If defective proportions <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>,
…, <em>p<sub>k</sub></em> are observed in <em>k</em> samples of size <em>n</em>,
our best estimate is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../images/propnEstimate.gif" width="72" height="58"></p>
<p> and the control limits  are therefore</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../images/propnLimits.gif" width="165" height="92"></p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>In a training period, it was observed that 4% of orders were incorrectly processed.
A control chart for the proportion of incorrectly processed orders in samples of
<em>n</em> = 20 orders has control limits</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../images/defectivePropnLimits.gif" width="255" height="94"></p>
<p>Since a proportion must always lie between 0 and 1, this means that the lower
control limit is <strong>effectively</strong> equal to 0.</p>
<p>A p-chart for eight further samples of <em>n</em> = 20 orders is shown below:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../images/defectiveChart.gif" width="546" height="268" class="summaryPict"></p>
<p>On day 7 the proportion of incorrectly processed orders (<sup>4</sup>/<sub>20</sub> =
0.2)  exceeds the upper control limit, the process is out
of control and should be investigated for special causes.</p>


<h2 class="pageName">11.3.5 &nbsp; Final comments</h2>

<p class="heading">Only act on special cause variation</p>
<p>One of the principles behind the use of control charts is that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Management should only intervene in a process if it is out of control, i.e. if
it is subject to special cause variation.</p>
</div></div>
<p>It has been found that the majority of problems in process management occur as
a result of changes introduced by management in response to <strong>perceived</strong> variation.
In other words, managers have a tendency to “meddle” or “tinker” with a process that
is merely exhibiting its inherent (i.e. common cause) variation.</p>
<p class="heading">Red bead experiment</p>
<p>Deming illustrated this tendency to fiddle with a stable process by devising a
famous experiment known as the <strong>red bead experiment</strong>. Briefly, the
experiment consisted of mixing together a large number of red and white beads in
a barrel or large jar. Participants were told that white beads were 'better' than
red ones.</p>
<p>'Workers' randomly picked samples of beads from the barrel and were rewarded or
reprimanded
by 'managers' based on the proportion of white beads. The actual number of white
beads is binomial with the same <em>n</em> and <em>p</em> for each sample &mdash; common
cause variation &mdash; so the intervention of the managers is totally unproductive.</p>
<p>Deming made the point that managers should not meddle with a stable process but
rather listen more to the workers who are in a much better position to suggest improvements
to the process.</p>
