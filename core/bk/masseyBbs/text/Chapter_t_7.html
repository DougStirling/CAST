<h1>Chapter 7 &nbsp; Testing Hypotheses</h1>
<h2>7.1 &nbsp; Introduction to hypothesis testing</h2>
<h3>7.1.1 &nbsp; Inference</h3>
<p>Estimation asks which values for an unknown parameter are consistent with data that have been collected. Hypothesis testing usually asks whether the data are consistent with some parameter values.</p>
<h3>7.1.2 &nbsp; Soccer league simulation</h3>
<p>Are some teams in a soccer league better than others, or is the end-of-season league table consistent with random results from equally-matched teams? A simulation can help to answer this question.</p>
<h3>7.1.3 &nbsp; Test for a proportion</h3>
<p>This page presents a simulation to test whether the number of observations observed in one category is consistent with a specified probability.</p>
<h3>7.1.4 &nbsp; Test for a mean</h3>
<p>A simulation is used to test whether a sample mean is consistent with a specified population mean.</p>
<h3>7.1.5 &nbsp; Common patterns in tests</h3>
<p>All hypothesis tests involve a null hypothesis, a test statistic, an alternative hypothesis and a p-value.</p>
<h3>7.1.6 &nbsp; Statistical distance</h3>
<p>The statistical distance between an estimate and hypothesised parameter value is the difference divided by the standard error of the estimate. It should have approximately a standard normal distribution if the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<h3>7.1.7 &nbsp; Tests based on statistical distance</h3>
<p>When testing a single parameter, we often use a test statistic that 'standardises' an estimate of the parameter — subtracting the hypothesised value and dividing by its standard error. This test statistic describes the statistical distance of the estimate from the null hypothesis value and has a distribution that is close to a standard normal distribution.</p>
<h3>7.1.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Simulation to test a propn (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to perform a simulation to test a hypothesis about a population proportion, π.</p>
<h3>7.1.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Simulation to test a mean (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>This exercise is similar but the simulation is from a normal population and tests the value of its mean, µ.</p>
<h2>7.2 &nbsp; Tests about means</h2>
<h3>7.2.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>For numerical populations, the null and alternative hypotheses usually specify values for the population mean. Tests are based on the sample mean.</p>
<h3>7.2.2 &nbsp; Test for mean (known σ)</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the distribution of the sample mean can be found when the null hypothesis is true. The p-value for the test is a tail area of this distribution.</p>
<h3>7.2.3 &nbsp; P-value from statistical distance</h3>
<p>The p-value is most easily found from the 'statistical distance' between the sample and hypothesised means. The p-value can be found as a tail area of the standard normal distribution and is approximately correct even when the population distribution is not normal.</p>
<h3>7.2.4 &nbsp; The t distribution</h3>
<p>When the population standard deviation is unknown, a different test statistic must be used. It has a standard distribution known as a t distribution.</p>
<h3>7.2.5 &nbsp; The t test for a mean</h3>
<p>The t distribution is used to obtain a p-value for tests about a population mean when the standard deviation is unknown.</p>
<h3>7.2.6 &nbsp; Testing with non-normal populations</h3>
<p>The t-test is based on an assumption that the population distribution is normally distributed. It can also be used with non-normal populations provided the sample size is large but should not be used to test the mean of a small sample if the distribution is skew.</p>
<h3>7.2.7 &nbsp; Exercise:   Test mean, with &sigma; known</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to perform a hypothesis test about the mean of a normal population whose standard deviation, σ, is known. The hypotheses must be specified, a z-score evaluated, the p-value found and the conclusion given.</p>
<h3>7.2.8 &nbsp; Exercise:   Test mean, unknown &sigma;</h3>
<p>In this exercise, the population standard deviation is unknown, so the test statistic must use the sample standard deviation and the p-value must be looked up from a t distribution.</p>
<h2>7.3 &nbsp; Tests about probabilities &amp; propns</h2>
<h3>7.3.1 &nbsp; Inference about categorical populations</h3>
<p>When the data are a random sample, the null and alternative hypotheses are usually expressed in terms of population parameters. For categorical samples, the hypotheses refer to the probabilities of the categories.</p>
<h3>7.3.2 &nbsp; P-value for testing proportion</h3>
<p>The p-value for testing a proportion is the probability of getting such an 'extreme' number of successes when the null hypothesis holds. It can be found from the binomial distribution.</p>
<h3>7.3.3 &nbsp; Another example</h3>
<p>An example shows how to use a binomial distribution to find the p-value for a test.</p>
<h3>7.3.4 &nbsp; One- and two-tailed tests</h3>
<p>If values in both tails of the binomial distribution support the alternative hypothesis, the tail probability must be doubled to give the p-value for the test.</p>
<h3>7.3.5 &nbsp; Tests based on normal approximation</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find the p-value for a hypothesis test.</p>
<h3>7.3.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Test using binomial distribution (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>The exercise in this page asks you to use a binomial distribution to perform a hypothesis test about a population proportion and interpret the results.</p>
<h3>7.3.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Test with normal approximation</h3>
<p>The exercise in this page uses a normal approximation to find the p-value for the above test.</p>
<h2>7.4 &nbsp; More about testing</h2>
<h3>7.4.1 &nbsp; Hypothesis tests and decisions</h3>
<p>In many applications, a different action is taken if the null hypothesis is 'accepted' or 'rejected'. Two different types of error are possible from such a decision — accepting the null hypothesis when it is false, or rejecting it when it is true.</p>
<h3>7.4.2 &nbsp; Decisions and p-values</h3>
<p>Many tests are conducted with a pre-specified probability of a Type I error — the significance level. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value for the test is lower than the significance level.</p>
<h3>7.4.3 &nbsp; P-values for other tests (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>P-values have the same properties and interpretation for all tests. A test for whether a population has a normal distribution is used as an example.</p>
<h3>7.4.4 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret a p-value (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>The p-value for any hypothesis test can be interpreted in terms of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
<h3>7.4.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret p-value in context (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>This exercise gives the p-value for a test and asks you to pick the correct conclusion, worded in terms of the problem context.</p>
<h3>7.4.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret p-value (harder) (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>This exercise is similar to the previous one but the wordings of the options makes it harder to pick the correct conclusion.</p>
