<h2 class="pageName">3.1.2 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Stems and leaves</p>
	<p>In a stem and leaf plot, the individual data values are represented by digits
called 'leaves' that are stacked to the right of a column of  'stems'. Each leaf
digit, together with the corresponding stem, gives the most significant digits of
the number.</p>
<p> A stem and leaf plot must be accompanied by a key that shows where the decimal
point appears in the combined stems and leaves.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stemLeaf.gif" alt="" width="141" height="165">
</p>



<h2 class="pageName">3.1.3 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h2>

<p class=heading>Need for more flexibility</p>
	<p>Sometimes basic stem and leaf plots are not flexible enough
&mdash; there would be either too many or too few rows of leaves to show the varying
density well.</p>
	<p>Repeating each stem 2 times (with leaves 0-4 on the lower copy and leaves
5-9 on the upper one) or 5 times (with leaves 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8-9 on the
different copies) gives intermediate numbers of stems.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_splitStems.gif" alt="" width="550" height="550"><br clear="all">
	</p>



<h2 class="pageName">3.1.4 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h2>

<p class=heading>Smoothness</p>
	<p>When drawing a stem and leaf plot, the aim is for a smooth shape to the stem
and leaf plot, and this is usually achieved by between 10 and 20 rows of leaves.</p>
	<p class=heading>Drawing by hand</p>
	<p>Stem and leaf plots are mostly used because they are easy to draw by hand:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Decide on the stems to use &mdash; usually between 10 and 20 of them.</li>
		<li>Scan down the values identifying the leaf digits and writing them against the value's stem.</li>
		<li>Finally, sort the leaves on each stem into order.<br clear="all">
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>To simplify drawing, values are truncated to give their stems and leaf digits,
not rounded. For example, 7.98 and 7.90 would both be displayed as leaf '9' on
the stem '7'.</p>



<h2 class="pageName">3.1.5 &nbsp; Dot plots</h2>

<p class="heading">Stacked dot plots</p>
<p>Stacked dot plots are related to stem and leaf plots, with the
vertical column of stems  replaced by a standard horizontal axis and the stacks
of leaves  replaced by stacks of crosses. The stacking again highlights regions
of high density effectively (tall stacks).</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stackedDotPlot.gif" alt="" width="400" height="150"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Some of the detailed information about the individual values in a stem and leaf
plot is lost, but this information is rarely important and the diagram shows the
distribution of values equally well.</p>
<p class="heading">Jittering the crosses</p>
<p>In a stacked dot plot, the grouping of crosses into stacks means that the crosses
cannot be drawn at exactly the correct position along the axis. An alternative to
stacking the crosses is to jitter them &mdash; draw them at exactly the correct position
along the axis but randomly move them away from it:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_jitteredDotPlot.gif" width="398" height="72"><br clear="all">
</p>
<p>Note that the vertical jittering is random and therefore tells you nothing about
the data.</p>
	


<h2 class="pageName">3.1.6 &nbsp; Density of values</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Density</p>
	<p>In a stacked dot plot (or stem and leaf plot), the highest stacks contain the most values. These stacks have the highest <strong>density</strong> of values.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_dotPlotCanopy.gif" name="dataImage" width="445" height="220"></p>
<p>Histograms more directly show how density varies along the axis.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.7 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Histograms</p>
<p>In a simple histogram, the axis is split into sub-intervals of equal width called <strong>classes</strong>. A rectangle is drawn above each class with height equal to the number of values  in the class &mdash; the <strong>frequency</strong> of the class.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_histo.gif" width="502" height="349"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.8 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h2>

<p class="heading">Aim of a 'smooth' histogram</p>
	<p>There is considerable freedom in the choice of histogram classes. The exact
shape depends on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Class width</li>
		<li>Start value for first class</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We usually choose classes with the aim of <strong>smoothness</strong> in the outline 
		of the histogram rectangles.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_classWidths.gif" width="368" height="360"></p>
	<p>The choice of 'best' classes is subjective, but...</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If your conclusions about what a histogram tells you about the data  depend on the choice of histogram classes, you are over-interpreting its shape.</p>
	</div></div>

	


<h2 class="pageName">3.1.9 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h2>

<p class="heading">Warning for small data sets</p>
	<p>For small data sets, changing the class width and the starting position for
the first class can give a <strong>surprising amount of variability in histogram
shape</strong>, so be extremely wary of over-interpreting features  such as
clusters or skewness.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is probably better to avoid using histograms unless there is a reasonable number of values &mdash; stacked dot plots are far less likely to mislead you over minor features.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.10 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h2>

<p class="heading">Relative frequency</p>
	<p>When all histogram classes are of equal width, histograms are often drawn 
		with a vertical axis giving the frequencies (counts) for each class. The vertical axis can alternatively be labelled with the <strong>relative frequencies</strong> (proportions) for the classes.</p>
	<p>(There is no harm in including both axes.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_relFreqHisto.gif" width="420" height="236"></p>
	<p class="heading">Area equals relative frequency</p>
	<p>An important property of histograms is that the proportion of values in one or more classes equals the proportion of the histogram area above these classes.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_area.gif" width="455" height="289"> </p>
	<p>Therefore,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Relative frequency = proportion of the total 
			area</p>
	</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.11 &nbsp; Drawing histograms by hand (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h2>

<p class="heading">Frequency table</p>
<p>A computer is normally used to draw histograms. Hand-drawn histograms are
based on a <strong>frequency table</strong> that lists the histogram classes
and their frequencies.</p>
<p>To avoid ambiguity in the histogram, the class boundaries should be chosen to ensure that no data values are on boundaries. For example,</p>
<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/freqTable2.gif" width="280" height="150"></div>
<p class=heading>Height of a histogram rectangle</p>
<p>To draw a histogram by hand with equal class widths, each class rectangle
can be drawn with height equal to its class frequency. If class widths vary,
we need to calculate the <strong>density</strong> for each class with the formula:</p>
<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/densityDefn.gif" width="284" height="39"> </p>
<p>and use this for the rectangle heights.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.1.12 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Mixed class widths</p>
<p>For some data sets, wider classes give a smoother histogram in some ranges of values (e.g. in the tail of a distribution) and narrower classes are better in other parts of the distribution (usually where there is greater density of values).</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p> In a correctly drawn histogram, each value contributes the same area. </p>
</div></div>
<p>Histograms can be drawn with mixed class widths, but it would be <strong>badly misleading</strong> to make the rectangle heights equal to either the class frequency or relative frequency.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_mixedClasses.gif" width="504" height="431"></p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">3.2 &nbsp; Understanding distributions</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">3.2.1 &nbsp; Outliers</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Outliers</p>
	<p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data are 
		called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
	<p>An outlier may have been 
		incorrectly recorded, or there may have been other anomalous circumstances
associated with it. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything
atypical can be found, outliers should be deleted from the data set and their
deletion noted in any reports about the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Outliers and skew distributions</p>
	<p>Deciding whether a value is an outlier or not is affected by the shape of
the distribution of values for the rest of the data.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Symmetric distribution</dt>
	</dl>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/outlierSymmetric.gif" width="443" height="156"> </p>
<dl>
		<dt>Skew distribution</dt>
		<dd>A distribution with a long tail to one side is called a <strong>skew</strong> distribution
&mdash; positively skew if the long tail is to the right and negatively skew if the
long tail is to the left. It  is not unusual for the extreme value in a very
skew distribution to be a  fair distance from the other values and may not be
an outlier.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/outlierSkew.gif" width="443" height="156"> </p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.2.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>If a dot plot, stem and leaf plot or histogram separates into two or more
groups of  values (clusters), this suggests that there may be more fundamental
differences between the 'individuals' in the groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_clusters.gif" width="499" height="140"></p>
	<p>Further investigation	should be made of	the individuals in the  clusters to find whether they also differ in other ways.</p>
	<p>If the clusters were less distinct, especially in small data sets, you would need external supporting evidence before concluding that the individuals separated into meaningful groups.</p>

  


<h2 class="pageName">3.2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Distribution of values</p>
	<p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, the <strong>distribution
of values</strong>  also contains useful information. Important features
are:</p>
<ul>
		<li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
		<li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
		<li>Whether a distribution is <strong>symmetric</strong> or  <strong>skew</strong> — do the tails appear similar at both sides?</li>
		<li>Other aspects of the <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 
		concepts of centre and spread are particularly important.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.2.4 &nbsp; Dangers of overinterpretation</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Dangers of overinterpretation</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Features in the distribution <strong>of a small data set</strong> may not
be meaningful.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Be careful <strong>not to overinterpret</strong> patterns in small
		data sets. Clusters, outliers or skewness may appear by chance even if there is
		no meaningful basis to these features. </p>
<p>Pronounced outliers or clusters may be taken as indicative of
		something meaningful in the underlying process. However <strong>less pronounced
			outliers or clusters must be supported by outside evidence</strong> before these features
		can be interpreted as meaningful.</p>





<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">3.3 &nbsp; Describing centre and spread</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">3.3.1 &nbsp; Centre and spread</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Summarising centre and spread</p>
	<p>Two important 
		aspects of a distribution of values are particularly important.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Centre</dt>
		<dd>The centre  is a 'typical' value around which the data 
			are located.</dd>
		<dt>Spread</dt>
		<dd>The spread  describes the distance of the individual 
			values from the centre.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/centerSpreadIdea.gif" width="325" height="109"> </p>
	<p>We will describe centre and spread with numerical 
		values called <strong>summary statistics</strong>. They provide particularly
concise and meaningful comparisons of different groups.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.3.2 &nbsp; Summaries of centre</h2>

<p class=heading>Median</p>
	<p>Half of the data values are below the median and half are above it:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/medianProperties.gif" width="500" height="140"></p>
	<p class=heading>Mean</p>
	<p>The mean  is: </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/meanEqn.gif" width="70" height="35"> </p>
	<p>If each value in a dot plot was a solid object resting on a beam with negligible mass, the mean is the value at which the beam will balance.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_balance.gif" width="451" height="139"></p>
	<p>Because of the leverage exerted by points far from the centre, the mean is further into the tail of a skew distribution than you might expect.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.3.3 &nbsp; Properties of median and mean</h2>

<p>Although both describe aspects of the 'centre' of a distribution, the median and mean are 
		not the same and can occasionally have very different values.</p>
	<p class=heading>Social vs economic indicator</p>
	<p>For some data sets, <strong>the median can be considered to be a social indicator,
		whereas the mean can be interpreted as an economic indicator</strong>. In a company,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the median salary indicates what the 'average employee' earns
			(half of the employees earn more and half earn less)</li>
		<li>the mean salary reflects the total amount paid as salaries in the company
			(it is <em>total</em>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<em>n</em>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Outliers</p>
	<p>An outlier has little effect on the  median,
		but affects the mean more strongly. The median is
		said to be more <strong>robust</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Skew distributions</p>
	<p>When a distribution  is fairly symmetrical, the mean and median
		are similar, but if the distribution is skew, then the mean is usually further
into the tail of the distribution than the median.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_meanMedian.gif" width="452" height="143"> </p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.3.4 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h2>

<p class="heading">Simple measures of spread</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Range</dt>
		<dd>Difference between maximum and minimum values</dd>
		<dt>Inter-quartile range</dt>
		<dd>The middle half of the values are within an interval of this length</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>These are (relatively) easy to understand and explain to others, but neither are commonly used.</p>
	<p class="heading">Standard deviation</p>
	<p>The standard deviation is a 'typical' distance of values from the sample mean.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations.gif" width="434" height="166"> </p>
	<p>The  standard deviation  is denoted by the letter <span class="black em">s</span>  and
is defined by:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/sdDefn.gif" width="115" height="52"></p>
	<p>The numerator, <span class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/ssqDevns.gif" width="70" height="26"></span>, depends on the distances of the values to the mean, so it will be small if the values are all close to the mean and big if they are far from the mean.</p>
	<p class="heading">Variance</p>
	<p>The square of the standard deviation, <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, is called the
sample <strong>variance</strong>. Variances are sometimes reported and used but
standard deviations are easier to interpret since they have  the same units as
the original data (e.g. kilograms or dollars).</p>

 


<h2 class="pageName">3.3.5 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h2>

<p class="heading">'Quarter-range' rule of thumb</p>
	<p>For many data sets, the standard deviation is just under 
		a quarter of the range.</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations2.gif" width="454" height="158"></td>
	</tr>
</table></div>

	<p>This is a simple rule, but is only very approximate. The standard deviation 
		can be more than a quarter the range in distributions with short tails or 
		much less if there are long tails or outliers.</p>
	<p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb</p>
	<p>The <strong>70-95-100 rule</strong> is more accurate. In many distributions, </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Approximately 70% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
		<li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
		<li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule holds approximately for most reasonably symmetric data 
		sets, but for skew data or distributions with long tails, outliers or clusters, it is often less accurate.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.3.6 &nbsp; Understanding means and st devns</h2>

<p>Understanding the
		definition of the standard deviation is much less important than knowing
its properties and having a feel for what its numerical value tells you about
the data. </p>
	<p class="heading">Guessing <em>s</em> from histogram</p>
<p>About 95% of the values should 
		be within 2<em>s</em> of the mean, so after dropping the top 2.5% 
		and bottom 2.5% of the values (histogram area), the remainder should 
		span approximately 4<em>s</em>. Dividing this range by 4 should 
		approximate the standard deviation.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/guessSD.gif" width="288" height="154"> </p>
	<p class="heading">Sketching a histogram from the mean and <em>s</em></p>
<p>Similarly, you should 
		be able to draw a rough sketch of a symmetric histogram with any mean and
standard deviation that you are given. (It would be centred on the mean and 95%
of the area would be within 2<em>s</em> of this.)</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.3.7 &nbsp; Warnings about mean and standard devn</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">The shape of a distribution</p>
<div class="boxed"><p>The mean and standard deviation hold <strong>no information about the shape</strong> of a distribution, other than its centre and spread.</p></div>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Frequency polygons</p>
<p>A <strong>frequency polygon</strong> is closely related to a histogram with equal class widths. It joins the midpoints of the tops of the class rectangles and tends to give a smoother outline than the corresponding histogram.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">3.4.4 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h2>

<p class="heading">Unhelpful detail when comparing groups</p>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain a lot of detail about
the distribution of values in a data set. This level of detail is useful when
examining a single data set, but when several groups of values are being compared,
the detail distracts from the main differences between the groups.</p>
<p>For example, the jittered dot plots below do not concisely summarise the differences
between the five groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_jitteredGroups.gif" width="413" height="224"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.4.5 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h2>

<p class="heading">Five-number summary</p>
<p>Five values are enough to capture a lot of information about the distribution of values in a data set.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The two <strong>extremes</strong>  (i.e. the minimum and maximum values).</li>
	<li>The <strong>lower quartile</strong>, <strong>median</strong> and <strong>upper quartile</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These values split the data set into four groups with approximately equal numbers of values.</p>
<p class="heading">Box plot</p>
<p>A box plot displays the five-number summary graphically.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_boxPlotDefn.gif" width="445" height="225"></p>
<p class="heading">Details</p>
<p>The median, <em>m</em>, is the middle value if there is an odd number of values in the data set. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two.</p>
<p>Different authors give slightly different definitions for the upper and lower
quartiles. One definition of the lower quartile is the median of the lowest half
of the data &mdash; i.e. of the values lower than <em>m</em>. (The upper quartile
would then be defined as the median of the top half of the values.)</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Provided you are consistent, different definitions of the quartiles  should lead you to the same conclusions.</p>

	<p>To display the distribution of values in a single set of data, a dot plot

<h2 class="pageName">3.5.1 &nbsp; Bivariate data sets</h2>

<p class="heading">The data matrix</p>
	<p>Many datasets contain several measurements from each <strong>individual</strong> (or plant, item
		or other unit). Each measurement type is called a <strong>variable</strong>. </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/structures/images/dataMatrix.gif" width="258" height="283"> </p>
	<p>A data set with more than one variable is called <strong>multivariate</strong>.
One with two
variables is called <strong>bivariate</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.5.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Scatterplots</p>
	<p>A scatterplot shows each individual as a single cross against a vertical axis
		(for the variable, <i>Y</i>) and a horizontal axis (for the other variable, <i>X</i>). </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/scatterValues.gif" width="279" height="189"> </p>
	<p>By convention,  the variable on the vertical axis is called <i>Y</i> and
		the variable on the horizontal axis is called <i>X</i>. </p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.5.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Scatterplots are needed to display  relationships</p>
	<p>The relationship between two variables cannot be determined from examination
 of the two variables in isolation. The two datasets shown in the scatterplots
below have the <strong>same marginal distributions</strong> for X and Y, but the variables are related
in very different ways.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/s_sameMargins.gif" width="509" height="211"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.5.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Marginal distributions</p>
<p><span class="full_text">Although 
		they do not contain information about the relationship between the variables,

<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/s_margins.gif" width="354" height="272"></p>






<h2 class="pageName">3.5.5 &nbsp; Strength of a relationship</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Strength of relationship</p>
<p>The most important information that a scatterplot shows is the <strong>strength</strong> of the relationship between the variables. The closer the points to a straight line or curve, the stronger the relationship.</p>
<p>If higher values of one variable tend to be associated with higher values
 of the other variable, the crosses on the scatterplot will be in a band with
positive slope and the relationship is said to be <strong>positive</strong>. If high values of one variable tend to be associated with low values of the 
	other variable, we say that there is a <strong>negative</strong> relationship.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/relationship/images/s_types.gif" width="398" height="323"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.5.6 &nbsp; Outliers</h2>

<p>The strength of the relationship between two variables is usually the most 
  important information that we gain from a scatterplot but a scatterplot may display other features.</p>
<p class="heading">Outliers</p>
<p>Values that seem 'different' from the rest of the data are called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
<p>An outlier may be an extreme value of one or other variable, but an individual
may be an outlier even though neither X nor Y is unusual on its own. One point
is an outlier in each of the three data sets below.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers.gif" width="312" height="157">       <img class="gif" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers2.gif" width="142" height="158"></p>
<p>The point is an
outlier in the righthand data set  because it lies well above the main group
of points &mdash; its y-value is much higher than others with similar x-values.</p>
<p class=heading>Importance of outliers</p>
<p>Outliers are features of a data set that <strong>must</strong> be carefully 
	checked. An outlier is often caused by a recording or transcription error, 
	so...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>First check that the values of the variables 
			are correctly recorded.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes an outlier arises because an individual is fundamentally different 
	from the others.  Identifying what makes the individual different  often gives considerable insight into the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The individuals should be further examined (perhaps 
			collecting further information from them) to try to assess whether the 
			outlier individual has distinct characteristics.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An outlier that is either extreme or that has other distinctive characteristics 
	would often be deleted from the data set, but should be mentioned in a report 
	about the data.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.5.7 &nbsp; Clusters</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>Sometimes the cloud of crosses separates into two or more groups which are 
		called <strong>clusters</strong>. As with outliers, clusters provide important 
		information that should be further investigated.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/relationship/images/s_clusters.gif" width="241" height="222"></p>
	<p>The individuals should be  examined (perhaps collecting further 
		information from them) to  assess whether the clusters correspond to
 individuals with distinct characteristics. For example, the clusters may correspond
 to males and females, or  two different species of plant.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.5.8 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h2>

<p class="heading">Interpreting outliers or clusters</p>
	<p>We have described some information that may be read from a scatterplot. But
		how strong must the corrresponding patterns be before we should report them? </p>
	<p>In both univariate and bivariate data sets, outliers or clusters must be <strong> distinct</strong> before we should conclude that they are real,
		in the absence of further external information confirming that the
		individuals are distinct. </p>
<p>Particularly in small data sets, outliers, clusters and other patterns may arise <strong>by chance</strong>, without being associated with any real features in the
		individuals. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Be careful not to overinterpret features in scatterplot unless they

<h2 class="pageName">3.5.9 &nbsp; Explanatory and response variables</h2>

<p class=heading>Causal relationships</p>
	<p>In many bivariate data sets, the relationship between the two variables is 
		not symmetric. From the nature of the variables and the way that the data were collected, it may be clear that one variable, X, can potentially influence the other, Y, but that the opposite is impossible.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln1.gif" width="297" height="65"></p>
<p>In such data, the variable X is called the <strong>explanatory variable</strong> and Y is called the <strong>response</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading>Experiments</p>
	<p>In an experiment,  the person conducting the experiment controls the values
of the explanatory variable. A well-designed experiment
always ensures that the relationship between the explanatory variable and response
is causal.</p>
<p class=heading>Observational studies</p>
	<p>If the person collecting the data has no control over either of the variables,
and simply records a pair of values from each individual, then the data are called <strong>observational</strong>.
If one variable is an earlier measurement than the other, we may also
be able to treat it as an explanatory variable and the later variable as the
response. </p>
<p>Even if the relationship is not causal, we are sometimes interested in <strong>predicting</strong> the
value of one variable from the other. The variable being predicted would then
be treated as the response.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">3.6 &nbsp; Correlation</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">3.6.1 &nbsp; Units for X and Y</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Units and strength of a relationship</p>
	<p>A numerical summary of the strength of the relationship between two variables
should not depend on the units in which we measure the two variables. The strength
of the two relationships between Sales (of ice cream) and Temperature are
the same in both of the scatterplots below.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/correlation/images/s_units_c.gif" width="550" height="219"></p>
	<p>We therefore start by defining <strong>units-free</strong> versions of the two variables and will summarise the strength of the relationship in terms of them.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.6.2 &nbsp; Units-free variables (z-scores)</h2>

<p class="heading">Z-scores</p>
