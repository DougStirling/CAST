<h1>Chapter 10 &nbsp; Time Series Analysis</h1>
<h2>10.1 &nbsp; Time series plots</h2>
<h3>10.1.1 &nbsp; Time series plots</h3>
<p>A time series plot is similar to a scatterplot with 'time' as the variable on the horizontal axis. Successive values are usually joined by lines to emphasise systematic movements in the series.</p>
<h3>10.1.2 &nbsp; Patterns in time series</h3>
<p>A few examples show time series with trend, seasonal pattern and other oscillations.</p>
<h3>10.1.3 &nbsp; Multiple time series</h3>
<p>An example shows four different time series on the same graph.</p>
<h3>10.1.4 &nbsp; Exercise: Identify time series patterns</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks you to identify whether a time series has trend, a seasonal pattern, a cyclic pattern or irregular variation.</p>
<h2>10.2 &nbsp; Smoothing</h2>
<h3>10.2.1 &nbsp; Moving averages</h3>
<p>Moving averages are a simple way to smooth out irregularities in a time series.</p>
<h3>10.2.2 &nbsp; More about moving averages</h3>
<p>When an even number of values is used for the moving averages, the smoothed values are at times half-way between those of the raw data. The method can be modified to give smoothed values at the times of the original values.</p>
<h3>10.2.3 &nbsp; Robust smoothing (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>Using running medians instead of means avoids the effect of outliers, but the result often looks 'stepped'. The use of running medians, followed by running means, is a good compromise.</p>
<h3>10.2.4 &nbsp; Exponential smoothing</h3>
<p>Exponential smoothing replaces each value with a weighted average of it and previous values. Unlike moving averages, it can be used right up to the end of the series.</p>
<h3>10.2.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Find smoothed values</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to evaluate an exponentially smoothed value and a moving average.</p>
<h2>10.3 &nbsp; Long-term trend</h2>
<h3>10.3.1 &nbsp; Linear trend</h3>
<p>Many time series steadily increase or decrease over time and a linear model may describe the trend. This kind of model can be fitted by least squares.</p>
<h3>10.3.2 &nbsp; Quadratic trend (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>If the trend is nonlinear, a quadratic model might describe the trend better and can also be fitted by least squares.</p>
<h3>10.3.3 &nbsp; Forecasting</h3>
<p>Linear and quadratic models can be used to forecast future values.</p>
<h3>10.3.4 &nbsp; Detrending a time series</h3>
<p>Linear and quadratic models describe the smooth long-term trend in a time series. A time series plot of least squares residuals (actual values minus trend) highlights shorter-term movements in the series.</p>
<h3>10.3.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Forecast a future value</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will forecast a future value using both linear regression and exponential smoothing.</p>
<h2>10.4 &nbsp; Seasonal data</h2>
<h3>10.4.1 &nbsp; Seasonal patterns</h3>
<p>Seasonal data may show a pattern that repeats at regular intervals.</p>
<h3>10.4.2 &nbsp; Smoothing out seasonal variation</h3>
<p>Moving averages with order equal to the number of seasons can smooth out seasonal variation.</p>
<h3>10.4.3 &nbsp; Estimating the seasonal effect</h3>
<p>The average difference between the data and the corresponding smoothed values in any month is called the seasonal effect for that month.</p>
<h3>10.4.4 &nbsp; Deseasonalised data</h3>
<p>Subtracting the seasonal effect from the raw data is called seasonally adjusting the data and the resulting values are called deseasonalised.</p>
<h2>10.5 &nbsp; Index numbers</h2>
<h3>10.5.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>Index numbers are widely used in business and industry to measure the changes of one or more related quantities over time.</p>
<h3>10.5.2 &nbsp; Simple price index</h3>
<p>A simple price index measures the price of a single item or commodity as a percentage of its price at a base time.</p>
<h3>10.5.3 &nbsp; Aggregate price index</h3>
<p>An aggregate price index combines the prices of several related items into a single index number.</p>
<h3>10.5.4 &nbsp; Laspeyres and Paasche indices</h3>
<p>These indices allow aggregate price indices to give differing weights to the items that make up the index.</p>
<h3>10.5.5 &nbsp; Deflating a time series</h3>
<p>The effect of a quantity such as inflation can be removed from a time series by deflating it.</p>
<h2>10.6 &nbsp; Multiplicative models and more</h2>
<h3>10.6.1 &nbsp; Additive and multiplicative models</h3>
<p>In some time series, the different components affect the data multiplicatively rather than additively. If the data are replaced by their logs, a multiplicative model becomes additive.</p>
<h3>10.6.2 &nbsp; Properties of multiplicative models</h3>
<p>In a multiplicative model, the seasonal pattern has greater amplitude when the trend is higher.</p>
<h3>10.6.3 &nbsp; Forecasting with multiplicative models</h3>
<p>A multiplicative model is fitted by using an additive model with the log data. The resulting forecasts are also of the log data, and so must be back-transformed to give a forecast in the original units.</p>
<h3>10.6.4 &nbsp; Analysing the right data (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>Many types of data should be modified before attempting to interpret them in a time series plot. Seasonal adjustment, transforming to constant dollars and use of per capita data are examples.</p>
<h3>10.6.5 &nbsp; Types of time series data (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>Time series can describe processes that are discrete or continuous, and the measurements of continuous processes can be aggregates or snap-shots. The values can also be either discrete or continuous.</p>
