<h1 class="sectionName">1.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.1.1 &nbsp; Why Statistics for Business?</h2>

<p class="heading">What is the purpose of Statistics?</p>
<p>When non-statisticians think of statistics, the first thing that usually 
	comes to mind is data. Large amounts of economic, social and administrative data
are routinely collected and published. Most researchers also collect data. Statistical
analysis uses data, but <strong>the data are not the goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Data are the basic commodity of the statistics. Without data, there is no 
	information on which to reach conclusions or base decisions.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data contain information.<br>
<strong>The purpose of statistics is to extract information from data.</strong></p>
</div></div>
<p>Large data sets must be summarised before patterns and relationships can 
	be seen. In smaller data sets, the problem 
	is usually that there is not enough information to get a clear answer to questions
of importance. Statistical methods are needed to describe precision and to ensure
that the highest precision is obtained.</p>
<p class="heading">Context</p>
<p>In general, <strong>users</strong> of statistics are neither interested in data
or in statistical methods, but are only interested in questions <strong>in their
own subject area</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The aim of statistics is to supply useful information to people whose 
	main area of expertise is <span class="red">not</span> statistics.</strong>	Statistical methods are only useful if they can extract information from data 
	to help answer discipline-specific questions. The underlying context is therefore 
	the most important aspect of any statistical analysis.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><strong>If you are not primarily 
			a statistician, you will appreciate statistical methods when they are 
needed in your career!</strong></p>
</div></div>


<h2 class="pageName">1.1.2 &nbsp; The statistical process</h2>

<p class="heading">Simple series of steps</p>
<p>The simplest application of statistics addresses a single question in 
	the context of some practical subject area.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/simpleProcess.gif" width="384" height="275"></p>
	<p>Statistics has a role to play in all stages of this process.</p>
	<p class="heading">Feedback</p>
	<p>The initial question is usually less well defined and a single 
		pass through the process is not enough. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/feedbackProcess.gif" width="324" height="275"></p>
<p>An example of feedback arises when 
		a small fraction of the data is initially collected and analysed. The information 
		obtained from this <strong>pilot study</strong> is used to refine the data 
collection process.</p>
<p>Another example of feedback  occurs when the initial 
		analysis reveals unusual or unexpected features in the data. Such features 
	may suggest further questions and therefore further data collection.</p>

		


<h2 class="pageName">1.1.3 &nbsp; Variation</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Reasons for variability</p>
	<p>Most statistical data sets contain measurements 
		 from a collection of 'individuals'. These individuals are not identical
so measurements  made from them also vary from individual to individual.</p>
<p>Even when the 'individuals' are very similar,  recorded measurements from 
them often vary due to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Variability of the environment in which the measurements were made</li>
		<li>Variability in the measurement procedure itself<br>
	</li>
	</ul>

<p class="heading">Explained and unexplained variation</p>


<p>In some data sets, we may be able to 'explain' some of the variation  in terms
of other known characteristics of the individuals. This helps us to understand
the data and is an important part of the information (signal) in it. The
remaining unexplained variation is  random 'noise'  that makes
it harder to detect the signal.</p>


<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">1.2 &nbsp; Variables and data</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.2.1 &nbsp; Variables and individuals</h2>

<p class="heading">Data structure</p>
<p>Context is critically important, but the <strong>statistical

<p>These three data sets  have the <strong>same basic structure</strong>, so the
same statistical methods  can be applied to all of them. </p>
<p class="heading">Variables and 'individuals'</p>
<p>Most data sets have a fairly simple structure. One or more measurements (<strong>'variables'</strong>)
are recorded from each of a collection of '<strong>individuals</strong>' (also called <strong>'cases'</strong> or
 '<strong><strong>units</strong></strong>'). The data can 
be presented in a  <strong>data matrix</strong>. </p>
<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/structures/images/dataMatrix.gif" width="258" height="283"> </p>


<p>If a data set contains only one variable &mdash; one measurement per individual
&mdash; it is called <strong>univariate</strong>. If there are two or more variables,
the data are called <strong>multivariate</strong>, with the term <strong>bivariate</strong> used
for the special case where there are exactly two variables.</p>


<h2 class="pageName">1.2.2 &nbsp; Types of variable</h2>

<p>Most variables in a data set are either numerical or categorical.</p>
<p class=heading>Numerical variables</p>
<p>These have values that are <strong>numbers</strong> and can 
	be further classified into:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Discrete numerical variable</dt>
	<dd>A variable whose values are <strong>whole numbers</strong> (counts) is 
		called discrete.</dd>
	<dt>Continuous numerical variable</dt>
	<dd>A variable that may contain <strong>any value within some range</strong> is called continuous.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Statistical methods that can be used for continuous variables are not always 
	appropriate for discrete variables.</p>
<p class=heading>Categorical variables</p>
<p>The values of a <strong>categorical</strong> variable are selected from a 
	small group of categories. A further classification is:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Ordinal categorical variable</dt>
	<dd>This arises when the  categories can be<strong> meaningfully ordered</strong>.</dd>
	<dt>Nominal categorical variable</dt>
	<dd>If it does not matter which way its categories are ordered, the variable is
called nominal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most statistical methods for categorical data can be applied to both ordinal 
	and nominal variables.</p>
<p class=heading>Labels</p>
<p>In some data sets, each individual has a unique 'name' that can be used to 
	identify it. We call this a <strong>label variable</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading><span class="blue">Warning!</span></p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When you see a column of numbers in your data matrix, do not 
			assume that it is a numerical variable.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Numbers are sometimes used as <strong>codes</strong> for categorical or label variables.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.3 &nbsp; Groups</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Categorical variables and groups</p>
	<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the individuals in a data set 
	into <strong>groups</strong>. We might treat  individuals with values &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;,
etc. as belonging to different groups.</p>
	<p>Conversely, if data were separately collected from different groups of individuals, 
		the resulting data sets could be combined with a categorical variable distinguishing 
		between the groups. Its values might be defined as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, etc. to identify the group membership of any individual.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A categorical variable and groups are often two ways of representing
the same data.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Data presented in a separate list for each group are  called <strong>unstacked</strong>
whereas if the data are presented
as a single list alongside a categorical variable, they are called <strong>stacked</strong>.</p>


<h2 class="pageName">1.2.4 &nbsp; Meaningful variables</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Defining new variables</p>
<p>When given a data set to analyse,  think about whether 
		its variables are the most useful ones to analyse. Sometimes a simple transformation
provides a variable whose values are more meaningful or highlight a different aspect
of the data.</p>
<p>For example, although the raw GDP of countries indicates their relative importance,
their GDP per capita gives better comparison of the relative wealths of individuals
in these countries:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="centred">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="centred" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; color:#000000">
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3"><strong>GDP per capita &nbsp; </strong>= &nbsp; </td>
		<td style="text-align:center"><strong>Country's total GDP</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #000000; line-height:3px; height:3px;"><img src="../../../en/../images/blankSquare.gif" alt=""></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align:center"><strong>Population</strong></td>
	</tr>
</table>
</div>
		
<p>As another example, although it is interesting to compare the calorie intake of  countries, it is <strong>also</strong> appropriate to look at their <strong>percentage change</strong> over different periods:</p>

<div class="centred">
	<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="centred" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; color:#000000">
			<tr>
				<td rowspan="3"><strong>%Increase &nbsp; </strong>= &nbsp; 100 &nbsp;× &nbsp;</td>
				<td style="text-align:center"><strong>1998 calories − 1993 calories</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #000000; line-height:3px; height:3px;"><img src="../../../en/../images/blankSquare.gif"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="text-align:center"><strong>1993 calories</strong></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
</div>
		


<h2 class="pageName">1.2.5 &nbsp; Relationships</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>We are often interested in relationships between variables. The correlation between two numerical variables summarises their relationship; a contingency table  contains information about the relationship between two categorical variables.</p>
<p>When the individuals can be split into groups, a categorical variable can
be used to define group membership. Differences between the groups can then be
expressed as a relationship between the grouping variable and other variables.
The following questions are essentially asking the same in two different ways:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Do boys and girls aged 14 perform the same at maths?</dt>
	<dt>Is there a relationship between gender and mark in a maths test?</dt>
</dl>
<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
	evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>
	

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Relationships can be much harder to interpret than you might think</p>
</div></div>





<h2 class="pageName">1.2.6 &nbsp; Sources of data</h2>

<p class="heading">Primary and secondary data</p>
<p>When data are collected specifically to answer your question of interest,
they are called <strong>primary data</strong>. Primary data may be collected
via a designed experiment or an observational study such as a survey.</p>
<p>Data that are collected by somebody else for another purpose are called <strong>secondary
data</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Types of primary data collection</p>
	<p>In an <strong>observational study</strong>, we passively 
		record (observe) values from each unit. Usually these units are sampled from some population.</p>
	<p>In an <strong>experiment</strong>, the researcher actively changes some characteristics 
		of the units before the data are collected. The values of some variables are therefore <strong>under the control of the experimenter</strong>. In other words, the experimenter 
		is able to <strong>choose</strong> each individual's values for some variables.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">1.3 &nbsp; Populations and samples</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.3.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h2>

<p class="heading">Population and census</p>
	<p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
		fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
		group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
	<p>Collecting measurements  from every item in the  population is called a <strong>census</strong>. A census is rarely feasible,  because of the  cost and time involved.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
	<p>We can usually obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
	collecting information from a selection of units from the population &mdash; a <strong>sample</strong>. Although a sample gives less accurate information than a census, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample  is  
		a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In it, each unit has the same chance 
		of being selected and some random mechanism is used to determine whether any particular unit is 
		included in the sample.	</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	<p>It is convenient 
		to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
		than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
		corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.3.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Variability</p>
	<p>Sampling from a population results in sample-to-sample variability in the information that we obtain from the samples.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.3.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h2>

<p class=heading>Parameters and statistics</p>
	<p>A random sample is often used to <strong>estimate</strong> some numerical
characteristic of the population, such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean of some variable</li>
<li>The proportion in some category</li>
</ul>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">

<h2 class="pageName">1.3.4 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h2>

<p class="heading">Selecting a sample manually (raffle tickets)</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Write the names (or other identification) of all population members on identical 
			pieces of paper,</li>
		<li>Mix them thoroughly in a box</li>
		<li>Select <em>n</em> pieces of paper (with or without replacement).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This method is  rarely used in research applications.</p>
	<p class="heading">Selecting a  sample with random numbers</p>
	<p>To select a random sample without replacement using random numbers,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Number all population members, starting from index 0.</li>
		<li>Generate a random index between 0 and the largest population index.</li>
		<li>If sampling <strong>without</strong> replacement and the generated index has already been selected, go back to step 2 and select another index.<br>
		</li>
		<li>Add the selected population member to the sample, then repeat steps 2. and 3. until a large enough sample has been selected.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="heading">Random number between 0 and <em>k</em></p>
	<p>The easiest way to generate a random number between 0 and 357 is to use a spreadsheet such as Excel &mdash; it has a function designed for this purpose, &quot;=RANDBETWEEN(0, 357)&quot;. A computer-generated random value is strictly called a <em>pseudo-random</em> number.</p>
	<p>If a computer is not available, a sequence of random digits can be generated:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px;"><tr>
<td>
	<ul>
		<li>Roll a 10-sided die several times.</li>
		<li>In a printed book of random digits, start at a random position in a random page, then use 
			a sequence of digits starting from there.</li>
	</ul></td>
<td style="padding-left:12px;"><img src="../../../en/popSamp/images/die.png" width="150" height="123"></td>
</tr></table>

	<p>A random number that is equally likely to have any value between 0 and 357 can be found by repeatedly generating 3-digit numbers (between 0 and 999) until a value between 0 and 357 is obtained.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">1.4 &nbsp; Sampling in practice</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">1.4.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h2>

<p>A simple random sample of individuals from a population is the easiest sampling scheme to understand, but other sampling schemes may give more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Grouping of individuals</p>
	<p>If the individuals in the population can be split into different groups (called <strong>strata</strong> in sampling terminology), it is often better to take a 
		simple random sample <strong>within each separate group</strong> than to sample 
		randomly from the whole population. This is called a <strong>stratified random 
			sample</strong>.</p>
	<p>The  proportion sampled from the different strata are usually fixed to be the same as the proportions of individuals in the strata in the population. In a simple random sample, the proportions sampled from the strata might not match the population proportions, so a stratified random sample should be more 'representative'.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/sampPractice/images/s_stratified.gif" width="418" height="351"> </p>
<p>The benefits from stratified random sampling are greatest if the measurement 
		being sampled is different in the different strata.</p>
	

<h2 class="pageName">1.4.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h2>

<p class="heading">Sampling frame</p>
	<p>Before taking a simple random sample or stratified random sample, a complete 
		list of all individuals in the target population must be available. This is called a <strong>sampling 
			frame</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
	<p>If a complete sampling frame is not available, it may be possible to group the target individuals into reasonably 
	small groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>, for which a complete list is available.</p>
	<p>Clusters are similar to the strata that are used for stratified sampling, but 
		are usually much smaller. For example, a cluster might contain all of the houses in a street, or all of the individuals in a household. It is not necessary to know beforehand how many individuals are in each of the clusters.</p>
	<p>For cluster sampling, a <strong>simple random sample of clusters</strong> is 
		selected, with all individuals in these clusters selected.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cost advantages</p>
	<p>Even when a complete sampling frame is available, cluster sampling might be 
		used to reduce the cost of sampling (or to increase the sample size for the same 
		cost) since it is often cheaper to record information from individuals in the 
		same cluster than from different parts of the sampling frame.</p>
	<p class="heading">Accuracy of cluster sampling</p>
	<p>The disadvantage of cluster sampling is that estimates are usually less accurate than the corresponding estimates from 
	a simple random sample of the same size.</p>
	<p>However the cost advantages would permit a larger sample size, so cluster sampling may give the best estimates <strong>for a fixed cost</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h2>

<p class="heading">Sampling from large populations</p>
	<p>Two-stage sampling is a sampling scheme that is related to cluster sampling, 
		but is of most use for large populations when the individuals are very widely 
		separated in some sense. For example, many polls are conducted to obtain <strong>national</strong> information about voting intentions or consumer purchases, and there is a high 
		cost associated with travelling between different regions.</p>
	<p>In two-stage sampling, the population is separated into groups of adjacent 
		individuals called <strong>primary sampling units</strong>. These primary sampling 
		units are typically large &mdash; for example a country might be split into 20 or more 
		regions. A small number of these are selected according to some sampling scheme, 
		then individuals are sub-sampled within each selected primary unit.</p>
	<p>Costs are reduced by limiting sampling to a small number of primary units. 
		For example, if individuals are only sampled from within say 5 regions, travelling 
		and accommodation costs will be considerably reduced.</p>
	

<h2 class="pageName">1.4.4 &nbsp; Cost & accuracy of sampling schemes (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h2>

<p>Stratified, cluster and two-stage sampling schemes have various advantages
and disadvantages, compared to a sample random sample that records information
from the same number of individuals.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Stratified sampling</dt>
<dd>A stratified random sample provides more accurate estimates of population
characteristics than a simple random sample of the same size from the population.
The advantage of stratified sampling is greatest when the strata differ in their
mean value of the characteristic.</dd>
<dt>Cluster sampling</dt>
<dd>As mentioned earlier, it is usually much cheaper to obtain information from
individuals in clusters than from the same number of individuals in a simple
random sample. However the penalty is that the mean population characteristic
is less accurately estimated.</dd>
<dt>Two-stage sampling</dt>
<dd>As with cluster sampling, two-stage sampling has lower cost than simple random
sampling but usually estimates population characteristics less accurately.</dd>

<p>To select a simple random sample from a population, a full list is needed
of individuals in the population &mdash; a <strong>sampling frame</strong>.</p>
<p>In some situations, a sampling frame may not be available. Even if we have
a sampling frame and can select a random sample from it, the resulting list of
individuals may be difficult to use by the people doing the actual data collection.</p>
<p class="heading">Systematic samples</p>
<p>It is often easier 'on the ground' to take a <strong>systematic</strong> sample
instead of a simple random sample. A systematic sample can be used whenever the
population can be ordered into a list in some way (though we don't need a full
list before starting data collection). Only the first individual is randomly
chosen, then every 10'th, 20'th, etc. individual is included in the sample.</p>
<p>Systematic sampling can also be used to replace simple random sampling within
other sampling schemes.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Stratified sampling</dt>
<dd>Systematic samples may be taken within each stratum of the population.</dd>
<dt>Cluster sampling</dt>
<dd>Systematic sampling is often used for selection of clusters (e.g. households
in a town).</dd>

<h2 class="pageName">1.4.6 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h2>

<p class="heading">Estimation</p>
	<p>The aim of sampling is usually to <strong>estimate</strong> one or more population 
		values (parameters) from a sample. Because we do not have complete information about the population, the estimate is unlikely to be <strong>exactly</strong> same as the value that we are estimating, 
		so we call the difference the <strong>error</strong> in the estimate. There are 
		different kinds of error.</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling error</p>
	<p>We have presented four different ways to sample from a population</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Simple random sample</li>
		<li>Stratified sample</li>
		<li>Cluster sample</li>
		<li>Two-stage sample</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each of these involves randomness in the sample-selection process. The error caused by randomness in the sampling process is called <strong>sampling 
			error</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Non-sampling error</p>
	<p>When sampling from some types of population &mdash; especially human populations 
		&mdash; problems often arise when conducting one of the above sampling schemes. For 
		example, some sampled people are likely to refuse to participate in your study.</p>
	<p>Such difficulties also result in errors and these are called <strong>non-sampling 
		errors</strong>. Non-sampling errors can be much higher than sampling errors 
		and are much more serious. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike sampling errors, the likely size of non-sampling errors cannot be estimated 
			from a single sample &mdash; it is extremely difficult to assess their likely size.</li>
		<li>Non-sampling errors often distort estimates by pulling them in one direction. 
			The estimates are then called <strong>biased</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is therefore important to design a survey to minimise the risk of non-sampling 
		errors.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.7 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h2>

<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
	<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
		from some members of the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>
	<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
		the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
		the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
		only a subgroup of it.</p>
	<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>
	<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Failure to contact the individuals.</li>
		<li>Refusal to participate in the study.</li>
		<li>Refusal to answer particular questions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
		survey are likely to be biased.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.8 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h2>

<p class=heading>'Inaccurate' responses</p>
	<p>The next two types of non-sampling error are caused by inaccurate information 
		being obtained from the sampled individuals.</p>
	<p class=heading>Instrument error</p>
	<p><strong>Instrument error</strong> usually results from poorly designed
		questions. Different wording of questions can lead to different answers being 
		given by a respondent. The wording of the question may be such as to elicit some
		particular response (a <strong>leading</strong> question) or it may simply be carelessly
		worded so that it is misinterpreted by some respondents. </p>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer error</p>
	<p><strong>Interviewer error</strong> occurs when some characteristic of the interviewer, such
		as age or sex, affects the way in which respondents answer questions.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.4.9 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h2>

<p>There are various different ways to collect information from human populations. 
	Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
	<p class=heading>Telephone</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response can be high.</li>
		<li>Coverage error is small.</li>
		<li>The number of questions must be kept very small.</li>
		<li>Inexpensive, so sample sizes can be greater.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Mailed questionnaire</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response is very high.</li>
		<li>Costs are higher than in a telephone survey.</li>
		<li>Mailed questionnaires can contain more questions than telephone surveys.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lowest non-response and other sampling errors.</li>
		<li>Interviewers must be well trained to reduce interviewer error.</li>
		<li>Most expensive.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires can be fairly long.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Houses are rarely selected at random. Often streets are randomly selected and every
		5th or 10th house in the street is approached. This is called a <strong>systematic
			sample</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Street corner</p>
	<p>Some surveys are conducted by approaching people in busy shopping centres or
		similar public places. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Large coverage errors.</li>
		<li>Least expensive and therefore widely used.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires must be small.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To reduce coverage errors, a <strong>quota sample</strong> is often used. Each 
		interviewer is told to interview fixed numbers of old, young, male, female, etc. 
		respondents to match the 
		corresponding proportion in the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Self-selected</p>
	<p>Phone-in or mail-in surveys are often conducted by radio stations and magazines. The
		respondents are usually so unrepresentative that the results are meaningless. These types
		of survey should be avoided. </p>




<h1 class="sectionName">1.5 &nbsp; Overview of the rest of the book</h1>


<div class="full_text">

<p class=heading>Summarizing Data</p>
  <p>The initial chapters of this e-book describe statistical methods to explore and summarise a data set. Choosing appropriate methods depends on the structure of the data set &mdash; the number and types of its variables.</p>
  <dl>
		<dt>Categorical variables</dt>
  	<dd>Chapter 2 describes graphical methods for looking at data sets with one or two categorical variables.</dd>
  	<dt>Numerical variables</dt>
  	<dd>Chapter 3 starts with graphical and numerical summaries of a single numerical 
  		variable. It then gives methods for describing the relationship between two numerical variables.</dd>
 	</dl>
  <p class=heading>Probability</p>
  <p>Chapters 2 and 3 deal with data that have already been collected, i.e. the past. We also want to think about what might happen in the future. The next two chapters consider how to make statements about the possible future value a variable might take. This is done using <strong>probability</strong>.</p>
  <dl>
  	<dt>Categorical variables</dt>
  	<dd>Chapter 4 deals with future values of a categorical variable &ndash; called an <strong>event</strong>. For example, will it rain tomorrow?</dd>
  	<dt>Numerical variables</dt>
  	<dd>Chapter 5 deals with future values of a numerical variable &ndash; called a random variable. For example,  what will tomorrow&rsquo;s exchange rate be?</dd>
 	</dl>
<p class=heading>Inference</p>
  <p>Inference means making a statement about a population based on data from a sample. To do this honestly, we must take account of randomness &mdash; if we collected the data again by repeating an experiment or collecting data from different people, the values would often be different. Here we need to combine the viewpoints of probability (what we expect to happen) and data summary (what actually did happen).</p>
  <dl>
		<dt>One variable</dt>
  	<dd>Chapters 6 and 7 develop the methodology to answer questions about a 
  		single numerical or categorical variable (confidence intervals and hypothesis 
  		tests).</dd>
  	<dt>Two or more groups</dt>
  	<dd>Chapter 8 presents confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare 
  		two or more groups.</dd>
</dl>
  <p class=heading>Special topics</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Relationships between numerical variables</dt>
	<dd>Chapter 9 introduces <strong>regression</strong> for modelling the relationship between two or more numerical variables.</dd>
	<dt>Time series</dt>
	<dd>Chapter 10 presents ways to summarise patterns in time series data and make forecasts of future values.</dd>
	<dt>Quality management</dt>
	<dd>Chapter 11 introduces some important concepts in managing quality, and shows how regularly collected data can be used to monitor the output of a processes.</dd>
