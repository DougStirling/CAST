<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; Intro &amp; Data Collection</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Why Statistics for Business?</h3>
<p>In business settings, data are collected to throw light on some question of importance to the business manager. Typically statistics will help you make decisions based on evidence. Statistical methods for analysis of data are a core part of statistics, but the context of the data is most important.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; The statistical process</h3>
<p>Statistical analysis is a process that involves identifying the questions of interest, data collection and analysis and producing a report. In real-life problems, the data collection and analysis steps may be repeated more than once.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; Variation</h3>
<p>When data are collected from a sample of individuals, there is natural variability that makes it hard to interpret results.</p>
<h2>1.2 &nbsp; Variables and data</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 &nbsp; Variables and individuals</h3>
<p>Most data sets contain one or more measurements from each of a collection of 'individuals' (also called 'cases' or 'units').</p>
<h3>1.2.2 &nbsp; Types of variable</h3>
<p>Variables are classified into numerical and categorical variables. A finer classification is also sketched.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 &nbsp; Groups</h3>
<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the 'individuals' into groups. Equivalently, grouped data can be represented in a data matrix with a categorical variable. </p>
<h3>1.2.4 &nbsp; Meaningful variables</h3>
<p>Sometimes a ratio or difference of two variables in a data matrix is easier to interpret than the original variables.</p>
<h3>1.2.5 &nbsp; Relationships</h3>
<p>For most data sets, we are interested in understanding the relationships between the variables. However interpreting relationships must be done with care since some relationships are not causal ones.</p>
<h3>1.2.6 &nbsp; Sources of data</h3>
<p>In an observational study, values are passively recorded from individuals. Experiments are characterised by the experimenter's control over the values of one or more variables.</p>
<h3>1.2.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Types of variables</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will classify various measurements as numerical (continuous or discrete) or categorical (ordinal or nominal).</p>
<h2>1.3 &nbsp; Populations and samples</h2>
<h3>1.3.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h3>
<p>A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h3>
<p>A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h3>
<p>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population. As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </p>
<h3>1.3.4 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h3>
<p>Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</p>
<h2>1.4 &nbsp; Sampling in practice</h2>
<h3>1.4.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h3>
<p>More accurate estimates can sometimes be obtained by taking separate random samples within different parts of the population.</p>
<h3>1.4.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h3>
<p>When individuals are grouped in clusters, it is often cheaper to sample complete clusters rather than separate individuals.</p>
<h3>1.4.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>When the target population is spread over a wide area, it may be cheaper to take a sample from only a few regions (groups of individuals), than to sample from all the regions.</p>
<h3>1.4.4 &nbsp; Cost & accuracy of sampling schemes (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>A stratified random sample is usually more accurate than a simple random sample of the same size. Cluster and two-stage samples are less accurate but can reduce costs considerably.</p>
<h3>1.4.5 &nbsp; Systematic sampling</h3>
<p>It is often easier to sample individuals who are regularly spaced in a list (e.g. every tenth individual) rather than randomly sampling from the whole list. In a systematic sample, only the first individual is randomly chosen.</p>
<h3>1.4.6 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h3>
<p>Samples are usually collected to estimate population characteristics. The ordinary variation caused by the sampling scheme is called sampling error. Practical difficulties with conducting the survey can cause biased estimates (non-sampling errors).</p>
<h3>1.4.7 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h3>
<p>Coverage error and non-response error prevent some individuals being included in the sample.</p>
<h3>1.4.8 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h3>
<p>Interviewer error and instrument error can result in 'incorrect' measurements from the sampled individuals.</p>
<h3>1.4.9 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h3>
<p>Survey information is collected by a variety of mechanisms, from mailed questionnaires to telephone. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
