<h1>Chapter 4 &nbsp; Basic Probability</h1>
<h2>4.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>Probability underlies methods of estimating population characteristics from samples. The concept of probability is closely related to that of proportions.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 &nbsp; Classical definition of probability</h3>
<p>When sampling a item from a population of values, the probability of any particular value is the proportion of population items with that value.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 &nbsp; Probability and proportion</h3>
<p>In other random situations, probability can be defined as a long-term proportion if more and more data was similarly collected.</p>
<h3>4.1.4 &nbsp; Empirical and subjective probability</h3>
<p>Numerical values for probabilities can be obtained from sample proportions or subjectively.</p>
<h3>4.1.5 &nbsp; Probability and numerical populations</h3>
<p>For numerical measurements, we are usually interested in the probability of getting a value within a particular range.</p>
<h3>4.1.6 &nbsp; Properties and rules of probability</h3>
<p>This page describes some rules that are obeyed by probabilities.</p>
<h3>4.1.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities for cards and dice</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for probabilities about a card drawn at random from a standard pack of playing cards or when two dice are rolled.</p>
<h3>4.1.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities and finite populations</h3>
<p>A finite categorical population is shown as a bar chart and the probability of a randomly sampled value being in a range of categories must be found.</p>
<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Conditional probability</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Contingency tables</h3>
<p>For data with two categorical variables we summarise frequencies for each combination of categories in a contingency table.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; Joint probabilities</h3>
<p>Bivariate categorical data are modelled as a sample from a population that consists of pairs of categorical values. The joint probability for any pair of categories is their population proportion.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; Marginal probabilities</h3>
<p>The marginal probabilities for a variable are the population proportions for its possible values. They can be found by summing joint probabilities.</p>
<h3>4.2.4 &nbsp; Conditional probability</h3>
<p>Conditional probabilites for a variable are proportions in a sub-population containing a specific value for the other variable. They are found by scaling the joint probabilities in that sub-population.</p>
<h3>4.2.5 &nbsp; Displaying probabilities</h3>
<p>Joint, marginal and conditional probabilities can be displayed graphically.</p>
<h3>4.2.6 &nbsp; Tree diagrams</h3>
<p>A tree diagram is another device useful for displaying and calculating conditional and joint probabilities. A situation summarised in a table of joint probabilities can be represented in tree diagram form, and vice versa.</p>
<h3>4.2.7 &nbsp; More about tree diagrams</h3>
<p>We can use a tree diagram for any situation that involves a sequence of events.</p>
<h3>4.2.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Find contingency table proportions</h3>
<p>In this exercise you are shown contingency tables and asked to find a joint, marginal or conditional proportion.</p>
<h2>4.3 &nbsp; Independence</h2>
<h3>4.3.1 &nbsp; Association and conditional probability</h3>
<p>The row and column categories in a table of joint probabilities are said to be associated if the conditional probabilities are different in different rows. If there is association, knowing the row tells you something about the likely column. The concept is similar to correlation for numerical variables.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 &nbsp; Definition of independence</h3>
<p>When the conditional distributions of the different rows of a contingency table are the same for all rows, the rows and columns are said to be independent. The definition of independence can be used for any pair of events.</p>
