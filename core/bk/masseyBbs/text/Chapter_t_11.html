<h1>Chapter 11 &nbsp; Control Charts</h1>
<h2>11.1 &nbsp; Total quality management</h2>
<h3>11.1.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>The quality of any process is critically important to its success. It is important to monitor quality and continually try to maintain or improve it.</p>
<h3>11.1.2 &nbsp; The statistical process</h3>
<p>A cycle of data collection and analysis is a central part of the quest for improvement to systems and processes.</p>
<h3>11.1.3 &nbsp; Finding the cause of problems</h3>
<p>If a problem is detected in a process, brainstorming and cause-and-effect diagrams can help to determine the cause of the problem.</p>
<h2>11.2 &nbsp; Control chart basics</h2>
<h3>11.2.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>Many business and industrial processes are continuously monitored in order to detect problems early.</p>
<h3>11.2.2 &nbsp; Run charts</h3>
<p>A run chart plots regular measurements from a process against time. Extreme values indicate problems with the process.</p>
<h3>11.2.3 &nbsp; Control limits</h3>
<p>For most distributions, almost all values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Control limits 3s on each side of the sample mean from training data can be used to indicate problems with the process.</p>
<h3>11.2.4 &nbsp; Other signals of being out-of-control</h3>
<p>Runs of successive values that are s or 2s from the mean can also be used to indicate problems in the process.</p>
<h3>11.2.5 &nbsp; False alarms</h3>
<p>False alarms occasionally happen even when the process is in control. Several successive triggers give a clearer indication of problems.</p>
<h3>11.2.6 &nbsp; Examples of run charts</h3>
<p>Control limits are set from variation when a process is under control then applied to future observations.</p>
<h2>11.3 &nbsp; Control charts in practice</h2>
<h3>11.3.1 &nbsp; Control charts based on samples</h3>
<p>In practice, regular small samples are selected from a process rather than individual values. Control charts can be based on the mean and range of these samples to separately target the mean level of the process and its variability.</p>
<h3>11.3.2 &nbsp; Control charts for means</h3>
<p>If individual values have a skew distribution, the ± 3s limits may be exceeded in 2% or more of values. Sample means are closer to normal, so a control chart for means rarely exceeds its control limits when the process is under control.</p>
<h3>11.3.3 &nbsp; Control charts for ranges</h3>
<p>A control chart for the range of successive samples can indicate increases in process variability.</p>
<h3>11.3.4 &nbsp; Control charts for proportions</h3>
<p>In many processes we want to monitor a proportion. A control chart for sample proportions can be used.</p>
<h3>11.3.5 &nbsp; Final comments</h3>
<p>Managers should act only when a process becomes out of control. It is counter-productive to act on common-cause variation.</p>
