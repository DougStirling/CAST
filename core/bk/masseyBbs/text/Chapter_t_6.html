<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Estimating Parameters</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Distribution of sample mean</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Parameters and statistics</h3>
<p>A summary value describing a population is called a parameter and the corresponding value in a sample is called a statistic. Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Variability of sample mean</h3>
<p>A sample mean has a distribution that is centred round the population mean, µ, but has smaller spread than the population's spread.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; Standard devn of sample mean</h3>
<p>The spread of the sample mean decreases as sample size increases. A formula is given for the standard deviation of the sample mean in terms of the sample size, n, and population standard deviation, σ.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Means from normal populations</h3>
<p>Sample means from normal populations also have normal distributions.</p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; Large-sample normality of means</h3>
<p>The shape of the sample mean's distribution is usually close to normal, even if the population distribution is skew or multimodal. The bigger the sample size, the closer the distribution to normal.</p>
<h3>6.1.6 &nbsp; Distributions of sums and means</h3>
<p>The mean of a random sample is approximately normal with s.d. equal to σ divided by √n. The sum of a random sample is also approximately normal, but its s.d. is σ times √n.</p>
<h3>6.1.7 &nbsp; Estimating variability from one sample</h3>
<p>It is possible to estimate the distribution of a sample mean from a single sample.</p>
<h3>6.1.8 &nbsp; Requirement of independence</h3>
<p>If the sample values are positively correlated, the standard deviation of the mean will be underestimated.</p>
<h3>6.1.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Spread of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise shows the distribution of the mean or sum of values from samples of different sizes from a normal population. You must match the distributions with their sample sizes.</p>
<h3>6.1.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Shape of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise examines understanding of the limiting normal distribution of the sample mean and sum as sample size increases, whatever the shape of the population distribution.</p>
<h3>6.1.11 &nbsp; Exercise: Distribution of mean and sum (cont)</h3>
<p>In this exercise, pop-up menus are used to specify the centre, spread and skewness of the distribution of a sample mean, sample sum or a single value, given the population distribution.</p>
<h3>6.1.12 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities relating to means and sums</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for the probability that the mean, the sum or a single value from a sample lies within some interval. Templates are provided to help evaluate the parameters of the sampling distribution and the z-scores for the endpoints of the interval.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Introduction to estimation</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Interest in populations</h3>
<p>When data are collected, we are usually more interested in the unknown population distribution from which we assume that the data were generated.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Interest in parameters</h3>
<p>A few numerical summaries of a population distribution (parameters) often capture its most interesting characteristics. The corresponding sample statistics provide estimates.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Applications of estimation</h3>
<p>This page gives a few examples where sample statistics are used to estimate important population parameters.</p>
<h3>6.2.4 &nbsp; Estimation error</h3>
<p>The difference between the population parameter and a sample estimate is called the error in the estimate.</p>
<h3>6.2.5 &nbsp; Distribution of errors</h3>
<p>Estimation errors vary from sample to sample and have distributions.</p>
<h3>6.2.6 &nbsp; Standard error and bias</h3>
<p>A good estimator has errors that are close to zero. The error distribution should ideally be centred on zero (unbiased) and have low standard deviation (standard error). The standard error is the standard deviation of both the estimator and the estimation error.</p>
<h3>6.2.7 &nbsp; Interval estimates</h3>
<p>An interval estimate is a range of values within which we are 'confident' that the unknown population parameter lies.</p>
<h3>6.2.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Distinguish between populations and samples</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks whether three statements describe populations or samples.</p>
<h3>6.2.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Distinguish between parameters and estimates</h3>
<p>This exercise asks whether three statements describe parameters or estimates.</p>
<h2>6.3 &nbsp; Standard error of mean</h2>
<h3>6.3.1 &nbsp; Error distribution for mean</h3>
<p>When using a sample mean to estimate a population mean, the errors have a distribution with mean zero. The standard deviation of the errors (standard error) is the standard deviation of the sample mean.</p>
<h3>6.3.2 &nbsp; Standard error when σ is known</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be evaluated.</p>
<h3>6.3.3 &nbsp; Interpreting the standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error has about 95% probability of being within ±2 standard errors of zero and is almost certainly within ±3 standard errors.</p>
<h3>6.3.4 &nbsp; Standard error when σ is unknown</h3>
<p>In most practical applications, the population standard deviation is unknown. The standard error of the sample mean can be approximated by replacing the population standard deviation by the sample standard deviation in its formula.</p>
<h3>6.3.5 &nbsp; Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the interpretation (and value) of the standard error (SE) and standard deviation (SD).</p>
<h3>6.3.6 &nbsp; Using SEs to compare estimators (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>If there are two alternative estimators of a parameter, the estimator with lower standard error is usually better. The sample mean is shown to be a better estimator of the centre of a normal population than the sample median.</p>
<h3>6.3.7 &nbsp; Exercise:   Find standard error of mean</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will calculate the standard error of the mean from the sample mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>6.3.8 &nbsp; Exercise:   Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for an interval containing about 95% of the values or an interval with 95% confidence of including the popn mean. The question provides either the sample standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.</p>
<h3>6.3.9 &nbsp; Exercise:   What affects the standard devn and standard error?</h3>
<p>This exercise asks 3 questions about the effect of sample size and spread of sample values on the sd and se, and about the interpretation of the se and sd.</p>
<h2>6.4 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean</h2>
<h3>6.4.1 &nbsp; Confidence interval from standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error for any unbiased estimator, has approximately 0.95 probability of being between -2SE and +2SE. An approximate 95% confidence interval for the parameter is therefore the estimate ±2SE.</p>
<h3>6.4.2 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean, known σ</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be found exactly. A 95% confidence interval is the sample mean ± twice this. (Or more exactly, 1.96 times the standard error.)</p>
<h3>6.4.3 &nbsp; Confidence level</h3>
<p>A simulation shows that 95% confidence intervals are random — they vary from sample to sample. About 95% of samples give confidence intervals that include the true parameter.</p>
<h3>6.4.4 &nbsp; Confidence level if σ is replaced by s</h3>
<p>In practice, the population standard deviation is usually unknown. If the population sd is simply replaced by its sample equivalent, the interval estimate has a lower confidence level than 95%.</p>
<h3>6.4.5 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean, unknown σ</h3>
<p>To get a 95% confidence level, a t-value from tables must replace the constant 1.96.</p>
<h3>6.4.6 &nbsp; Properties of 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>A simulation demonstrates that the resulting 95% confidence intervals have probability 0.95 of including the population mean.</p>
<h3>6.4.7 &nbsp; Other confidence levels</h3>
<p>All earlier confidence intervals had 95% confidence level. Replacing 1.96 (or a value from t tables) with other values gives interval estimates with different confidence levels.</p>
<h3>6.4.8 &nbsp; Examples</h3>
<p>Some examples of 95% confidence intervals for population means are given and interpreted.</p>
<h3>6.4.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Find approx 95% CI from standard error</h3>
<p>This exercise displays an estimate and standard error and asks for an approximate 95% confidence interval. Various different types of parameters are estimated (not just means).</p>
<h3>6.4.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Find confidence intervals, known &sigma;</h3>
<p>In this exercise, confidence intervals are requested with a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels, but with known population standard deviation</p>
<h3>6.4.11 &nbsp; Exercise: Find CIs, known and unknown &sigma;</h3>
<p>In this exercise, the questions involve a mixture of types with known and unknown population standard deviation and with 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels.</p>
<h3>6.4.12 &nbsp; Exercise: What affects width of confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, sample standard deviation and confidence level affect the width of a CI for the mean.</p>
<h3>6.4.13 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</p>
<h2>6.5 &nbsp; Estimating proportions</h2>
<h3>6.5.1 &nbsp; General framework for estimation</h3>
<p>The methodology for describing the accuracy of a sample mean using standard errors and confidence intervals can also be used for other parameter estimates.</p>
<h3>6.5.2 &nbsp; Estimating a proportion</h3>
<p>A sample proportion estimates the corresponding population proportion, π. There is likely to be an error in this estimate and these errors have a distribution.</p>
<h3>6.5.3 &nbsp; Error distribution</h3>
<p>The estimation errors have a type of binomial distribution that is scaled to have mean zero. Its standard deviation is the standard error of the proportion.</p>
<h3>6.5.4 &nbsp; Normal approximation to error distribution</h3>
<p>If the sample size is high enough, the error distribution is approximately normal. This page gives a few examples for which the error distribution is found.</p>
<h3>6.5.5 &nbsp; Confidence interval for proportion</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence interval for a population proportion is the sample proportion ± 1.96 times its standard deviation. Its confidence level is only approximately 95% and guidelines are given for the minimum sample size.</p>
<h3>6.5.6 &nbsp; Other confidence levels</h3>
<p>Replacing 1.96 with other values gives interval estimates with different confidence levels.</p>
<h3>6.5.7 &nbsp; Properties of 95% CI for proportion</h3>
<p>If samples are repeatedly taken, about 95% of them result in 95% confidence intervals that include the population proportion. Guidelines are given for the minimum sample size to make the confidence level close to 95%.</p>
<h3>6.5.8 &nbsp; Confidence interval examples</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence intervals for a proportion are found and interpreted for several data sets.</p>
<h3>6.5.9 &nbsp; Margin of error</h3>
<p>The margin of error for a survey is related to a confidence interval. It is close to a 95% CI when p is 0.5, but underestimates the accuracy of small or large sample proportions.</p>
<h3>6.5.10 &nbsp; Exercise: Find standard error of proportion</h3>
<p>A template is provided in this exercise to help evaluate the standard error of a sample proportion.</p>
<h3>6.5.11 &nbsp; Exercise: Find CI for probability</h3>
<p>This exercise requests a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence intervals for a probability. A normal density can be used to find the relevant z-score and a template helps evaluate the 'plus-minus' value.</p>
<h3>6.5.12 &nbsp; Exercise: What affects width of CI?</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, confidence level and population probability affect the width of a CI for the probability.</p>
<h3>6.5.13 &nbsp; Exercise: Interpret a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise presents 3 different statements about a 95% confidence interval and asks which is correct.</p>
