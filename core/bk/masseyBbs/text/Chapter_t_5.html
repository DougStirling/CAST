<h1>Chapter 5 &nbsp; Probability Distributions</h1>
<h2>5.1 &nbsp; Discrete distributions</h2>
<h3>5.1.1 &nbsp; Introduction and examples</h3>
<p>A discrete probability distribution describes a variable that can take on discrete values, each with its probability. The variable can be categorical or discrete. Categorical variable were dealt with in Chapter 4. Here we are concerned with discrete numerical variables. For example, the variable X might be the number of cars sold by a dealer in a day.</p>
<h3>5.1.2 &nbsp; Bar charts and probabilities</h3>
<p>Probabilities for a discrete variable can be displayed with a bar chart. The height of each bar is the probability of that outcome.</p>
<h3>5.1.3 &nbsp; Expected value</h3>
<p>The mean of a numerical variable describes a typical or average value.  The expected value of a distribution has a similar interpretation and is also called the distribution’s mean.</p>
<h3>5.1.4 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h3>
<p>Whereas the expected value of a  variable is its average, the standard deviation is a measure of the variation or spread. In finance, expected value can be interpreted as average, and standard deviation is associated with risk.  If two returns have the same expected value, the one with the greater standard deviation carries greater risk.</p>
<h2>5.2 &nbsp; Binomial distributions</h2>
<h3>5.2.1 &nbsp; Properties of counts and proportions</h3>
<p>The sample proportion is a statistic that varies from sample to sample. The sample count in a category is also random with a discrete distribution.</p>
<h3>5.2.2 &nbsp; Binomial distribution</h3>
<p>The sample count in a category has a standard distribution called a binomial distribution with parameters n and π.</p>
<h3>5.2.3 &nbsp; Binomial probability examples</h3>
<p>The binomial distribution can be used to find probabilities relating to sample counts.</p>
<h3>5.2.4 &nbsp; Mean and standard deviation</h3>
<p>There are simple formulae for calculating the mean (or expected value) and standard deviation for a variable with a binomial distribution.</p>
<h3>5.2.5 &nbsp; Binomial assumptions</h3>
<p>A few assumptions must be satisfied by a sample count for it to have a binomial distribution.</p>
<h3>5.2.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Are variables binomial?</h3>
<p>This exercise describes four random variables and asks which have binomial distributions.</p>
<h3>5.2.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Match bar charts to parameters</h3>
<p>You are given information about the parameters of a binomial distribution in these two exercises and are asked to pick which of four alternative bar charts describes it. In the first exercise, the parameters are directly provided but the second exercise requires careful reading of the wording of the question.</p>
<h3>5.2.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Find binomial probabilities</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will use the information in the question to set the parameters of a binomial distribution then read off the probability by dragging over the bar chart of the binomial probabilities. (The computer does the calculations.)</p>
<h2>5.3 &nbsp; Continuous distributions</h2>
<h3>5.3.1 &nbsp; Introduction and examples</h3>
<p>Whereas a discrete variable can only take separate (discrete) values, a continuous numerical variable can take on any value on a continuous scale. For continuous variables, it is meaningful to consider the probability of a value within an interval such as P(0.8 < X < 1.2) but  probabilities for specific values such as P(X = 1.0) are zero.</p>
<h3>5.3.2 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h3>
<p>If the vertical scale on a histogram is such that the total area under the histogram equals 1 and the class interval becomes very small the histogram takes on the appearance of a smooth curve, called a probability density curve (pdf).</p>
<h3>5.3.3 &nbsp; Probability and area under pdf</h3>
<p>For a continuous variable, P(a < X < b) is the area under a probability density curve between  X = a  and  X = b. This is how we should visualise the probability, even though in practice we use standard tables or Excel formulae and templates to actually calculate the area (probability).</p>
<h3>5.3.4 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities and numerical populations</h3>
<p>This exercise is simlar to the one on the previous page but relates to a numerical population that is summarised by a histogram. The probability must be estimated roughly 'by eye' from the area under the histogram.</p>
<h3>5.3.5 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities from continuous distributions</h3>
<p>In this exercise, probabilities are obtained from the areas under a probability density function.</p>
<h2>5.4 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2>
<h3>5.4.1 &nbsp; Importance of normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are sometimes useful as models for data, but the main reason for their importance is that sample means and many other summary statistics have approximately normal distributions.</p>
<h3>5.4.2 &nbsp; Shape of normal distributions</h3>
<p>All normal distributions look the same on a scale of standard deviations from the mean.</p>
<h3>5.4.3 &nbsp; Sketching a normal distribution</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are centred on their mean and have hardly any area beyond 3σ  on each side. A small area (about 5%) is over 2σ away from the mean.</p>
<h3>5.4.4 &nbsp; Some normal probabilities</h3>
<p>The probabilities of being within (σ, 2σ, and 3σ) of the mean are (0.68, 0.95 and 0.997) for all normal distributions. This is a close match to the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb for numerical data sets.</p>
<h3>5.4.5 &nbsp; Normal probability plots</h3>
<p>A normal probability plot is an informal graphical method to help assess whether a data set comes from a normal distribution. Curvature in the probability plot suggests that the data may not be normal.</p>
<h3>5.4.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Normal distribution parameters</h3>
<p>One exercise asks you to guess the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Another requests a sketch of a normal distribution given its mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>5.4.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities without calculations</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb gives the approximate probability of a value within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. Te exercise uses this rule of thumb to find some normal probabilities without formal calculations.</p>
<h2>5.5 &nbsp; Normal distribution calculations</h2>
<h3>5.5.1 &nbsp; Z-scores</h3>
<p>Any value, x, can be translated into a z-score that gives the number of standard deviations above the mean.</p>
<h3>5.5.2 &nbsp; Finding normal probabilities</h3>
<p>Z-scores have a standard normal distribution (mean 0 and s.d. 1). The probability of a value less than x can be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>5.5.3 &nbsp; Other probabilities</h3>
<p>The probability that X is greater than a specified value or is between two values can also be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>5.5.4 &nbsp; Normal tables (opt) (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>If a computer is not available, tables of probabilities for the standard normal distribution are used to find normal probabilities.</p>
<h3>5.5.5 &nbsp; Finding normal quantiles</h3>
<p>The inverse problem of finding the x-value corresponding to a given probability is also solved using z-scores. If normal tables are used, they must be looked up differently.</p>
<h3>5.5.6 &nbsp; Exercise: Probability and area under pdf</h3>
<p>Exercise asks for a normal probability by reading an area under a normal histogram (pdf).</p>
<h3>5.5.7 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities from z-scores</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page is similar to the previous exercise, but the question must be first translated into one involving a z-score. The required probability is read off a standard normal histogram (pdf).</p>
<h3>5.5.8 &nbsp; Exercise: Expected count in sample</h3>
<p>Instead of the probability of getting a value within some range, the questions in this exercise ask for the expected number out of n items. </p>
<h3>5.5.9 &nbsp; Exercise: Find X from probability</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks the inverse problem; given a probability, it ask for the corresponding range of values using a standard normal histogram (pdf). </p>
<h2>5.6 &nbsp; Normal approximation to binomial</h2>
<h3>5.6.1 &nbsp; Normal approximation to binomial</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, the distribution of the sample count in a category becomes close to a normal distribution.</p>
<h3>5.6.2 &nbsp; Normal approximation examples</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find binomial probabilities.</p>
<h3>5.6.3 &nbsp; Exercise: Find normal approximation</h3>
<p>You are asked to find the parameters of a normal approximation to a binomial distribution in this exercise.</p>
<h3>5.6.4 &nbsp; Exercise: Probabilities from normal approximation</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for probabilities relating to a binomial distribution but requires that you use a normal approximation to evaluate them.</p>
