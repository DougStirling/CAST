<p>A simple random sample of individuals from some population is conceptually 
the easiest sampling scheme. However more accurate estimates of population characteristics 
can often be obtained with different sampling schemes.</p>
<p class="heading">Groups within a population</p>
<p>If the individuals in the population can be split into different groups (called 
<strong>strata</strong> in sampling terminology), it is often better to take a 
simple random sample <strong>within each separate group</strong> than to sample 
randomly from the whole population. This is called a <strong>stratified random 
sample</strong>.</p>
<p>In stratified random samples, random samples are usually taken from the different 
strata in proportion to the number of population values in the strata. For example, 
if a population of 1,000 values is split into three strata of <em>N</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;500, <em>N</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;300 and <em>N</em><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;200 
values and a sample of <em>n</em> = 50 is to be taken, then samples of <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;25, <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;15 and <em>n</em><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10 
would be taken from the three strata &mdash; i.e. <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> of the 
population within each stratum.</p>

	<p class="heading">Sampling from male and female students</p>
	<p>For example, a simple random sample of 40 students from a class of 200 males 
	and 200 females might (by chance) include 25 males and 15 females.</p>
	<p>A stratified 
		random sample would randomly select 20 males and 20 females, ensuring that the 
		sex-ratio in the sample matched that in the population.</p>
</div>
<p>The benefits from stratified random sampling are greatest if the measurement 
being sampled is different in the different strata. For example, we might want 
to estimate the mean summer income of the students. If male students tend to have 
higher incomes than female students, a stratified random sample based on gender 
will be more accurate than a simple random sample.</p>

<p class="heading">Groups with different variability (advanced, not examined)</p>
<p>The size of the sample taken from each stratum is often proportional to the number of individuals in the stratum. However this proportionality is not  essential and greater accuracy may be 
obtained by selecting larger samples from strata with greater variability.</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p class="heading">Mean profits of companies</p>
	<p>An extreme example of disproportionate sample sizes occurs when using sampling 
to estimate the mean profits of companies. If a list of 'large' companies is available, 
it is often best to record information from <strong>all</strong> of the large 
companies but only sample a small fraction of the smaller companies.</p>
	</div>
<p>If sample size is not proportional to stratum size, the overall sample mean is 
	no longer appropriate for estimating the overall population mean. If there are <em>k</em> strata of size <em>N</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>N</em><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<em>N<sub>k</sub></em>, 
and samples of size <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<em>n<sub>k</sub></em> 
are taken from the strata, giving means <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub>1</sub></span>, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub>2</sub></span>, ..., <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub><em>k</em></sub></span> 
, then the population mean should be estimated by</p>
