<p class="heading">Problems with using a binomial distribution when <em>n</em> 
is large</p>

<p>Although the number of 'successes' in a random sample always has a binomial 
distribution, it is computationally difficult to obtain probabilities from a binomial 
distribution when <span class="em black">n</span>  is large. In a large random sample of say <span class="em black">n</span>  = 10,000 categorical values, probabilities of interest usually involve summing 
the probabilites for a large number of individual values for the number of successes.</p>
<p class=eqn>P(X < 5,600)&nbsp; =&nbsp; P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 5,599)
</p>

<p>We next describe a way to approximate such probabilities without summing so 
many values. </p>

<p class="heading">Normal approximation</p>
<p>Fortunately, the shape of the binomial distribution becomes close to a normal distribution's shape when the sample size, <em>n</em>, increases. As a result, it is possible to use a normal distribution as an approximation and find probabilities such as <span class="eqn">P(X&nbsp;<&nbsp;5,600)</span> from that.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
	<p>In the diagram below, use the sliders to observe that for any fixed π, 
the shape of the binomial distribution becomes closer to normal as <em>n</em> 
increases. </p>

<p class="heading">Formulae for the binomial mean and standard deviation</p>
  
<p>Not only does the proportion of successes, <span class="em black">p</span> , 
have a distribution that is close to normal when <span class="em black">n</span>  increases, but it is also possible to obtain formulae for the mean and standard 
deviation for this approximating distribution. Since the number of successes,<span class="em black"> x</span> <span class="black">&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>np</em></span>, 
is a constant times <span class="em black">p</span> , 
there are similar formulae for the mean and standard deviation of <span class="em black">x</span> .</p>

<p>The diagram below shows a binomial distribution and its normal approximation.

<p>Use the sliders to verify that the binomial distribution has a very similar 
shape to its normal approximation when <em>n</em> 
is large. </p>

<p>With <em>n</em> 
fairly large and π 
moderate, drag over the bars of the binomial barchart. The binomial probability 
of getting a count less than <em>x</em> 
is shown beneath the barchart. The corresponding probability from the normal approximation 
is shown on the right. </p>

<p>Observe that probabilities obtained from the normal approximation are close 
to the true binomial probabilities when <em>n</em><i> 
is </i> fairly large. </p>

<p>Finally, note how we use values of
<em>x</em>
that end in '.5' for the normal approximation. This is sometimes called a
<strong>continuity correction</strong>.</p>
