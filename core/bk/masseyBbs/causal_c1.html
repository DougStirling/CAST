<p class="heading">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>In most data sets, we are interested in the relationship between the variables. 
This is most obviously the case when the data consist of two numerical variables 
(<a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_correlation')">correlation</a> and <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_simpleRegn')">least squares</a> give information about the relationship) or two 
categorical variables (a <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_groupedCat')">contingency table</a> and <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_conditProb')">conditional proportions</a> help show 
the relationship).</p>
<p>We will examine relationships between  variables in a lot more detail in later sections. This page discusses some general issues about relationships.</p>
<p class="heading">Groups and relationships</p>
<p>Questions about differences between two or more groups can <strong>also</strong> 
be expressed in terms of relationships between variables if group membership is 
represented by a categorical variable. For example, if we have collected data 
about incomes from a sample of males and a sample of females, we would be interested 
in comparing these two groups &mdash; i.e. the relationship between income and gender.</p>

<dd>Is there a relationship between price and sales?</dd>
<dt>Which of three different varieties of corn tastes best?</dt>
<dd>Is there a relationship between corn variety and taste?</dd>
<dt>Do males working in a car yard sell more cars than females?</dt>
<dd>Is there a relationship between gender and car sales? </dd>

	<p>Relationships can be much harder to interpret than you might think</p>

<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
	evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.
