<p class="heading">Additional triggers for an out-of-control process </p>
	<p>The most commonly used indication of a process being out-of-control is a  
		value outside the upper and lower control limits (more than three standard deviations 
		away from the centre line). This is sensitive to changes to the process mean 
		or increases in the process variability. </p>
	<p>Additional triggers have been proposed that are also sensitive to systematic
		changes in a process. These are all based
		on successive values within 1, 2 or 3 standard deviations from the centre (Zones C, B or A).	</p>

<p>Only the first three of these need be remembered in this course.</p>
