<p class="heading">Aim of a 'smooth' histogram</p>
	
<p>There is much more freedom in the choice of histogram classes than in the corresponding 
classes for stem and leaf plots. When drawing histograms, we usually choose classes with the aim of <strong>smoothness</strong> in the outline 
of the histogram rectangles.</p>
	
<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Ages of patients admitted to cardiac unit</p>
<p>The histogram of the hospital admission data below is a little jagged &mdash; we 
informally interpret the histogram in the same way as the smooth red curve that 
has been superimposed 'by eye' on it.</p>

<p class="heading">Flexibility in class width</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no unique way to draw a histogram &mdash; different definitions of the histogram classes result in different histograms. The histogram classes should be chosen with the goal of smoothness and the main choice that determines smoothness is  class width. Where possible, class boundaries should be 'neat' numbers such as multiples of 2, 5 or 10.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <ul>
    <li>When the classes are too narrow, the outline becomes jagged.</li>
    <li>When the classes are wide, the outline becomes blocky.</li>
  </ul>
</div></div>
<p>It is relatively easy to reject histograms with <strong>extremely</strong> narrow or wide classes, but  there are usually several alternative histograms with moderate class widths that display the data equally well.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>Use the smallest class width that is not too jagged.</p>
</div></div>
<p>There is no substitution for trial-and-error in the choice of histogram classes, though we will usually tell you the classes to use in assignments and exams!</p>
<p class="heading">Flexibility in starting point of classes</p>
<p>Choosing a good class width is  most important but there is also flexibility in where the first class starts so the initial class boundary  does not need to be on a multiple of the class width. For example, the classes could be (3&nbsp;to&nbsp;5), (5&nbsp;to&nbsp;7), etc. Shifting the classes to the left or right  affects a histogram's shape but  does not usually have a major impact on its smoothness.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>Long-distance telephone calls</p>
<p>The histogram below shows the distribution of the lengths of 200 long-distance 
telephone calls (in minutes) from a company's head office.</p>

<div class="centred"> 
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="550" height="340">

		<p>The four buttons under the histogram adjust the histogram classes. Use them to investigate how the histogram shape is affected by the choice of classes and, in particular, by the class width. Which histogram 
		is smoothest (and therefore best)? </p>
		<ul>
<li>When class width is less than 1.0, the histogram starts to look jagged</li>
<li>When class width is greater than 2.0, the histogram starts to become blocky 
and shape information between 0 and 5 is lost by the grouping.</li>
</ul>
		
<p>Choice of a 'best' class width is a subjective judgement and any class width 
			between 1.2 
and 2.0 would be acceptable for this data set, though a class width at the lower 
		end of this range is better. </p>
	</div>

<p>Choosing histogram classes to get a 'smooth picture'  makes its 'message' clearer when you include it in reports. However the choice of histogram classes, within reason, should not affect your conclusions about the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If your conclusions about what a histogram tells you about a data set depend on the choice of histogram classes, you are over-interpreting its shape.</p>
