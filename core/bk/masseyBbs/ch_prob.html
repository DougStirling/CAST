<p>The concept of probability is closely related to the idea of proportion in 
a data set. The <strong>probability</strong> that a randomly chosen person from 
a group has black hair is equal to the proportion of people in a group with this 
hair colour.</p>
<p>Probability is used to describe any situation where the observed outcome is 
random. Probability has characteristics that are described in this chapter.</p>
