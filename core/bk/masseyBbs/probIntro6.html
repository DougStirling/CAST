<p class="heading">Informal introduction to some properties of probability</p>

<p>Whether probability is defined through sampling from a finite population, or 
sampling from a hypothetical infinite population, it obeys the same rules.</p>
<p>We only informally introduce some of the ideas here. It is easiest to understand 
them in the context of sampling a single value from a finite population.</p>
<p class="heading">Probabilities are always between 0 and 1</p>
<p>For any event, <em>A</em>,</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>0 ≤ P(<em>A</em>) ≤ 1</p>
</div></div>
<p>This follows from the fact that probabilities are really proportions.</p>
<p class="heading">Meaning of probabilities 0 and 1</p>
<p>For any event, <em>A</em>,</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p style="text-align:left">If the event <em>A</em> cannot happen then P(<em>A</em>) = 0<br>
		If the event <em>A</em> is certain to happen then P(<em>A</em>) = 1</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">State of bank account</p>
<p>Consider the event that a savings account has a negative balance. The probability 
of this event is 0 since savings accounts are not allowed to go into debt.</p>
<p>The probability that a cheque account is 'either in credit or has zero balance 
or is in debt' is 1 since it is certain that it will be in one of the three states.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Probability that an event does not happen</p>
<p>For any event, <em>A</em>, there is a 'reverse' event that <em>A</em> does <strong>not</strong> occur, called its <strong>complement</strong>. The notation <em>A</em>' is used for the complement of <em>A</em>.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>P(<em>A</em> does not happen) &nbsp;= &nbsp;P(<em>A</em>') &nbsp;= &nbsp;1 - P(<em>A</em>)</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Customer purchases</p>
<p>If a proportion 0.2 of customers entering an electrical shop make a purchase, 
then a proportion (1 - 0.2) = 0.8 do not make a purchase. Since probabilities 
are really proportions, the same result holds for them.</p>
</div>
<p class="heading">Addition law</p>
<p>When two events cannot happen together, they are said to be <strong>mutually 
exclusive</strong>. Two events, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, are therefore mutually exclusive if:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>P(<em>A</em> and <em>B</em>) &nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;0</p>
</div></div>
<p>If the events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are mutually exclusive, there is a simple way to calculate the probability that at least one of the two events occurs:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>P(<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>) &nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;P(<em>A</em>) + P(<em>B</em>)</p>
</div></div>
<p>If the events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are <strong>not</strong> mutually exclusive, this formula must be generalised.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>P(<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>) &nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;P(<em>A</em>) + P(<em>B</em>) - P(<em>A</em> and <em>B</em>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; &nbsp;&nbsp;P(<em>A</em>) + P(<em>B</em>)</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Travel to university</p>

<p>Sixty Wellington first year students completed a survey in their first Statistics for Business class. One of the questions was “What travel method brought you to University today? (Name the <u>one</u> method that covered the greatest distance)”.</p>
<p>Of the 60 students, 26 walked, 3 cycled, 8 came by train, 15 came by bus and the rest came by private car or motorcycle. The different modes of transport are mutually exclusive since each student could only report  one.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; The probability that the main method of transport is by public transport is</p>
<p class="eqn">P(train or bus) &nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;P(train) + P(bus) &nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>/<sub>60</sub> + <sup>15</sup>/<sub>60</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;0.383</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;The probability that a student did not walk is</p>
<p class="eqn">P(did not walk) &nbsp;= &nbsp;1 – P(walk) &nbsp;= &nbsp;1 – <sup>26</sup>/<sub>60</sub> &nbsp;= &nbsp;0.567</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Independence</p>
<p>When sampling two or more values at random <strong>with replacement</strong> 
from a population, the choice of each value does not depend on the values previously 
selected. The successive values are then called <strong>independent</strong>.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>In random sampling with replacement, or random sampling 
		from an infinite population, successive values are independent.</p>
</div></div>
<p>On the other hand, if sampling without replacement from a finite population, 
	successive sample values are <strong>not</strong> independent. The second value 
	selected cannot be the same as the first value, so knowing the first value affects 
	the probabilities when the second value is selected.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>In random sampling without replacement from a finite 
		population, successive values are <span class="black">not</span> independent.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Independence can be given a more precise definition, but this informal definition 
	is enough for our purposes here.</p>

<p class="heading">Rolling dice</p>

<p>When two or more dice are rolled, this is usually done such that the second 
die has probability <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> for each value, irrespective of the value that appeared 
on the first die. The values that appear in the first and second dice are therefore independent.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">More about probability</p>

<p>In the rest of this chapter, we will extend 
some of these ideas about probability.</p>
