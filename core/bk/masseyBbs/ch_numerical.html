<p>It is very difficult to get useful information from  a list of the raw values
in a numerical data set.</p>
<p>Graphical summaries of the data are particulary effective
for highlighting the important information about a single numerical variable. Two particular
aspects of its distribution of values &mdash; the centre and spread &mdash; are particularly
important and numerical summaries of centre and spread are discussed.</p>
<p>For data sets containing two numerical variables, the relationship between the
variables is also important. Graphical and numerical summaries of their relationship
are  described at the end of the chapter.</p>
