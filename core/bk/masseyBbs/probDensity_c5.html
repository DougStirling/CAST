<p class="heading">Shape of a probability density function</p>
<p>A probability density function (i.e. population histogram) can have any shape, 
though it is usually a fairly smooth curve. Indeed, we often have only rough information 
about its likely shape from a single sample histogram.</p>

  <p class="heading">Normal distributions</p>
<p>One family of symmetric continuous probability density functions called <strong>normal 
distributions</strong> is particularly useful. The normal distribution is often used to model data that is approximately symmetric and bell-shaped (although sometimes the approximation is poor).</p>
<p>The shape of the normal distribution depends on two numerical values, called 
	<strong>parameters</strong>, that can be adjusted to give a range of symmetric 
	distributional shapes. The two normal parameters are called µ 
	and σ 
	and are the distribution's mean and standard deviation.</p>

<p>Use the two sliders to adjust the normal parameters. Observe that the
location and spread of the distribution are changed, but other aspects of its shape
remain the same for all values of the parameters.
</p>

<p class="gray">Note also that the total area under the probability density function remains the same (exactly 1.0) for all values of the parameters. This holds for <strong>all</strong> probability density functions.

<p class="heading">Normal distribution as a model for data</p>
<p>A normal distribution is sometimes used as a population to model the variability 
in a data set. (The data are assumed to be a random sample from this population.) 
On the basis of a single set of data, there is rarely enough information about 
the shape of the underlying distribution to be <strong>sure</strong> that a normal 
distribution is the 'correct' population, but it is often a close enough approximation.</p>

<p class="heading">Job satisfaction ratings</p>
<p>Merchandise buyers are critically important to the success or failure of retail 
ventures, both through negotiations over pricing and decisions about the types 
of product that will be stocked. Because of high turnover of staff in this area 
(estimated to be over 25 percent per year), research was carried out to determine 
the factors related to turnover.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows job satisfaction ratings of a sample of buyers on a 
scale of 0 (worst) to 30 (best), with a superimposed normal probability density 
function. </p>

<p>Use the sliders to adjust the normal parameters to obtain as close as possible a match
to the histogram. This normal distribution can be used as an approximate model for how the
data might have arisen.
</p>

<p class="gray">We have used a subjective procedure of matching the shapes of the histogram and probability density 'by eye'. A more objective way to 'estimate' the normal parameters will be presented in the next chapter. Click the button <strong>Best fit</strong> to apply this objective method.
</p>

</div>
<p>Many data sets cannot be modelled by a normal distribution. A normal distribution 
		would <strong>not</strong> be an appropriate model for ... </p>

<ul>
  <li>data that are discrete (counts)</li>
  <li>data that have a skew distribution (with long tail to the left or right)</li>
  <li>data that have very long tails (with most values close to the centre, but a small
  proportion of values very far from the mean).</li>
  <li>data that contain two or more clusters of values.</li>
</ul>

  <p>For some data sets with skew distributions, the logarithms of the values have a more symmetric distribution. A normal distribution may be a reasonable 
    model for the <strong>transformed</strong> data. </p>

<p>Do not assume that all data sets that you meet can be modelled adequately 
by normal distributions.</p>

is that...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Many summary statistics have normal distributions (at least approximately).</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the next chapter, we will show that
<a href="javascript:showNamedPage('randomMean5')">the mean of a random sample has a distribution 
that is close to normal</a> when the sample size is moderate or large, <strong>irrespective 
of the shape of the distribution of the individual values</strong>.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the distributions of the following summary statistics are 
approximately normal when sample size is moderate or large...</p>
<ul>
<li>A sample proportion</li>
<li>The slope and intercept of a least squares line</li>
<li>The difference between the means of two samples</li>
<li>The difference between two proportions</li>
</ul>
<p>Since most statistical methods require an understanding of the variability 
of such summary statistics, it is important that you become familiar with the 
properties of normal distributions.</p>
