<p class="heading">Two-tailed tests for differences</p>

<p>The hypothesis tests on the previous page were appropriate for situations
with some kind of symmetry between our attitudes towards the two groups &mdash; the
alternative hypothesis did not specify any sign for the difference between the population
means. This type of test is a <strong>two-tailed</strong> test since test statistics
in <strong>both</strong> tails of the t distribution suggest that the alternative hypothesis
holds.

<p class="heading">One-tailed tests for differences</p>

<p>In other situations, we want to test whether one specific group has a <strong>higher</strong>
mean than the other group. Alternatively, we may want to test whether one specific group
has a <strong>lower</strong> mean than the other group. These are called
<strong>one-tailed</strong> tests.

<p class="heading">Test statistic and p-value</p>

<p>The test statistic for a 1-tailed test is identical to that for a 2-tailed 
test, but the p-value is obtained from only one tail of the t distribution. We 
illustrate below for testing the hypotheses,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="blue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub></strong></span> </p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is only supported by very small values of <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>. 
This also corresponds to small values of the test statistic <span class="em black">t</span> , 
so the p-value is the lower tail probability of the t distribution. </p>
