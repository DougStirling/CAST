<p class="heading">Testing for a difference between the two population means</p>

<p>When samples are obtained from two groups, we often want to assess whether there is
any evidence of a difference between the groups. Differences between the groups may involve
differences between the spreads, skewness or other features of the distributions in the two
groups. However the difference of most practical importance is a difference between the
<strong>means</strong> of the groups.
</p>

<p class=eqn><span class="blue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub> &minus; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub> &minus; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 0</strong></span></p>

<p>The summary statistic that throws most light on these hypotheses is the difference
between the sample means,
<span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>.
Testing therefore involves assessment of whether this difference is unusually far from zero.
</p>

  <p class="heading">Test statistic and p-value</p>
  <p>The difference <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span> 
	is standardised (by dividing by an estimate of its standard deviation). If this test statistic has a large value, it suggests that there is a difference in the means. As in Chapter 7, the distribution of the test statistic is not normal, because we are estimating the standard deviations. However if the two groups really have the same means, µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;µ<sub>2 </sub>, its distribution can be approximated by a t distribution, whose degrees of freedom are the minimum of the degrees of freedom in the two separate samples, the minimum of (n<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) and (n<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>-&nbsp;1).</p>
  <p> To assess whether our observed difference is 'unusually' far from zero, we therefore compare this test statistic with the t distribution.</p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/twoGroupInf/images/pValue.gif" width="454" height="266"></p>

<p>As with the hypothesis tests that we described in Chapter 7 (and indeed <strong>all</strong> other hypothesis tests), a p-value near zero gives evidence that 
the null hypothesis does not hold &mdash; evidence of a difference between the group 
means.</p>

<p class="heading">Examples</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the p-value for testing whether the means in two 
groups are the same is evaluated and interpreted.</p>

<p class="heading">Properties of p-values</p>

<p>It is important to understand that a statistical hypothesis test cannot provide 
a definitive answer about whether two groups have different means. The randomness 
of sample data means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>p-values are also random quantities, and</li>
<li>there is some chance of us being misled by an 'unlucky' sample. </li>
</ul>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Simulation when the underlying means are the same (H<sub>0</sub> is true)</p>
<p>The diagram below allows samples of size 20 to be selected from two populations, both
of which are normal with mean 75 and standard deviation 8.</p>

<div class="centred">

<p>Take several samples and observe the variation in the resulting p-value. The 
p-values are <strong>usually</strong> greater than 0.1, so we would <strong>usually</strong> 
conclude that there is no evidence of a difference between the means.</p>
<p>However about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of the p-values are less than 0.1, 
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> are less than 0.05 and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> 
are less than 0.01.</p>

<p class="heading">Simulation when the underlying means are different (H<sub>A</sub>

<p>In the next simulation, the underlying population means are 70 and 80 &mdash; a 
difference of 10.</p>

<p>Again take several random samples from the model. Observe that the p-value 
is <strong>usually</strong> very close to zero and we <strong>usually</strong> 
conclude that there is strong evidence that the population means are different.</p>
<p>However <strong>occasionally</strong> the sample means are closer and the p-value 
is larger.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>There is a chance of getting a large p-value and
