<p class="heading">Problems with selecting a simple random sample</p>
<p>In order to select a simple random sample from a population, we require a full list of individuals in the population. This is called a <strong>sampling frame</strong>. The individuals in this list can then be distinguished by their position in the list and random numbers can be used to randomly select individuals.</p>
<p>In some situations, a full list is unavailable before the survey is conducted. For example, it may be decided to check for defects about 100 items produced by a production line in a day. However the total number of items that will be produced is unknown at the start of the day.</p>
<p>Even if we have a full sampling frame and a simple random sample can be selected, the resulting list of individuals (or items) to be sampled will have no internal structure and is often difficult to use by the people doing the actual data collection.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The quality control inspector might be told to examine the 7th, 33rd, 54th, ... items produced. It will be difficult to keep track of which items to sample.</li>
	<li>An interviewer conducting interviews in a town would be given a list of addresses of sampled households. The interviewer must refer to this list before approaching each household.</li></ul>
<p class="heading">Systematic samples</p>
<p>It is often easier 'on the ground' to take a <strong>systematic</strong> sample instead of a simple random sample. A systematic sample can be used whenever the population can be ordered into a list in some way (though we don't need a full list before starting data collection).</p>
<ul>
	<li>The items produced by a production line appear in order.</li>
	<li>A path can be selected that passes all  houses in a town. (This is the path that an interviewer might take.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a systematic sample, only the first individual is randomly chosen. For example, if we want to sample about 1 in 20 items from the population, we would randomly choose one of the first 20 individuals.</p>
<p>Successive individuals are found at regular intervals from the first. For example, if the first item selected above is the 12th, then we would also select the 32nd, 52nd, 72nd, ...</p>
<ul>
	<li>The quality control inspector may be told to examine the 12th item produced, then every 20th item from then.</li>
	<li>The interviewer may be told to interview the 5th house in a long street then every 10th house from then.</li>
</ul>
<p class="heading">Systematic sampling in conjunction with other sampling schemes</p>

<p>Systematic sampling can also be used to replace simple random sampling within other sampling schemes.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Stratified sampling</dt>
	<dd>Systematic samples may be taken within each stratum of the population.</dd>
	<dt>Cluster sampling</dt>
	<dd>Systematic sampling is often used for selection of clusters (e.g. households in a town).</dd>
