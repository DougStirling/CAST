<page dir="en/decision" filePrefix="decision1" summaryDir="en/decision" summaryFilePrefix="s_decision1" videoDir="en/decision" videoFilePrefix="v_decision1">In many applications, a different action is taken if the null hypothesis is 'accepted' or 'rejected'. Two different types of error are possible from such a decision — accepting the null hypothesis when it is false, or rejecting it when it is true.</page>
<page dir="bk/masseyBbs" filePrefix="decision3" summaryDir="bk/masseyBbs" summaryFilePrefix="s_decision3" videoDir="bk/masseyBbs" videoFilePrefix="v_decision3">Many tests are conducted with a pre-specified probability of a Type I error — the significance level. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value for the test is lower than the significance level.</page>
<page dir="bk/masseyBbs" filePrefix="testPValue5" nameOverride="P-values for other tests" note="Optional (not examined)#(opt)" summaryDir="en/testPValue" summaryFilePrefix="s_testPValue5" videoDir="en/testPValue" videoFilePrefix="v_testPValue5">P-values have the same properties and interpretation for all tests. A test for whether a population has a normal distribution is used as an example.</page>

<page dir="en/testPValue" filePrefix="e_testPValue1" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Interpret a p-value" note="Optional (not examined)#(opt)">The p-value for any hypothesis test can be interpreted in terms of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.</page>
<page dir="en/testPValue" filePrefix="e_testPValue2" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Interpret p-value in context" note="Optional (not examined)#(opt)">This exercise gives the p-value for a test and asks you to pick the correct conclusion, worded in terms of the problem context.</page>
<page dir="en/testPValue" filePrefix="e_testPValue3" nameOverride="#r#Exercise: #+#Interpret p-value (harder)" note="Optional (not examined)#(opt)">This exercise is similar to the previous one but the wordings of the options makes it harder to pick the correct conclusion.</page>
