<page dir="bk/masseyBbs" filePrefix="twoGroupPropn2b" summaryDir="bk/masseyBbs" summaryFilePrefix="s_twoGroupPropn2b">If the two population proportions are equal, the difference between the sample proportions has a distribution with mean zero. It is approximately normal and its standard deviation can be estimated.</page>
