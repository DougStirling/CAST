<page dir="en/twoGroupInf" filePrefix="twoGroupInf_c1" summaryDir="en/twoGroupInf" summaryFilePrefix="s_twoGroupInf1" videoDir="en/twoGroupInf" videoFilePrefix="v_twoGroupInf_c1">The difference between the means of two samples from normal populations has a normal distribution whose mean and s.d. can be found from the population means and s.d.s. This is the approximate distribution even when the populations are non-normal.</page>

The error distribution is approximately normal with mean 0. A formula for its standard deviation is given.</page>
