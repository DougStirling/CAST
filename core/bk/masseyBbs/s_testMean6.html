<p class="heading notPrinted"><span class="heading">Assumptions about population</span></p>
<p>The theory behind the t-test is based on the data being a random sample from a population with a normal distribution.</p>
<p>If the population distribution is <strong>not</strong> normal, the test statistic does not have exactly a t distribution &mdash; its exact shape depends on the shape of the population distribution. However  if the sample size, <em>n</em>, is large enough, the t-test statistic  has approximately a t-distribution.</p>

<p>The p-value from a t-test can be used for testing the mean of non-normal populations, <strong>provided <em>n</em> is fairly large</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This does not hold for small samples.</p>

<div class="boxed">
<p>The t-test should not be used with small samples if the population distribution is clearly non-normal.</p>
