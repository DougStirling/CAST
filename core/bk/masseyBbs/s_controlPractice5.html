<p class="heading">Only act on special cause variation</p>
<p>One of the principles behind the use of control charts is that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Management should only intervene in a process if it is out of control, i.e. if
it is subject to special cause variation.</p>
</div></div>
<p>It has been found that the majority of problems in process management occur as
a result of changes introduced by management in response to <strong>perceived</strong> variation.
In other words, managers have a tendency to “meddle” or “tinker” with a process that
is merely exhibiting its inherent (i.e. common cause) variation.</p>
<p class="heading">Red bead experiment</p>
<p>Deming illustrated this tendency to fiddle with a stable process by devising a
famous experiment known as the <strong>red bead experiment</strong>. Briefly, the
experiment consisted of mixing together a large number of red and white beads in
a barrel or large jar. Participants were told that white beads were 'better' than
red ones.</p>
<p>'Workers' randomly picked samples of beads from the barrel and were rewarded or
reprimanded
by 'managers' based on the proportion of white beads. The actual number of white
beads is binomial with the same <em>n</em> and <em>p</em> for each sample &mdash; common
cause variation &mdash; so the intervention of the managers is totally unproductive.</p>
<p>Deming made the point that managers should not meddle with a stable process but
rather listen more to the workers who are in a much better position to suggest improvements
to the process.</p>
