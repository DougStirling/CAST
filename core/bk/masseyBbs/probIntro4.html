<p class=heading>Empirical probability</p>
<p>The previous definition is fine for conveying the concept of a probability, but is not a practical way to determine its value &mdash; we cannot repeat an infinite number of times.</p>
<p>In practice, we must <strong>estimate</strong> such probabilities from a finite number of repetitions, giving an <strong>empirical probability</strong>.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>We can use empirical probabilities in the same way as exact theoretical probabilities but should remember that they are only estimates.</p>
</div>

<div class="diagram">
	<p class="heading">Light bulb failing</p>
	<p>The company manufacturing the light bulbs tested 50 of them at 300 volts and found that 12 failed. The company's empirical estimate of the probability of this type of light bulb failing such a voltage spike is <sup>12</sup>/<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.24.</p>
	<p class="heading">Car sales</p>
	<p>What is the probability that there will be no sales in a car yard tomorrow? Past records show that out of the previous 500 days when the car yard was open for business, there were 25 days when there were no sales made. The empirical estimate of the probability of no sales tomorrow is therefore <sup>25</sup>/<sub>500</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.05.</p>
	</div>
<p class="heading">Subjective probability</p>
<p>There are other situations in which it is difficult to imagine repeatedly collecting similar data. Assigning  numerical values to probabilities about such situations is much harder to do objectively. Any such probabilities involve some personal judgement and are therefore <strong>subjective probabilities</strong>. </p>

	<dt>Will the All Blacks win the next World Cup?</dt>
	<dd>What is the probability that the All Blacks will win the next World Cup?  After the event this question is nonsense. Before the event, we are asking a question about the future. In this case we will have different opinions.  One person might think “not much chance at all” and another person might say “a very good chance”.  Putting values on these (say 0.05 &amp; 0.90) demonstrates defining probabilities subjectively.</dd>
	<dt>Business decisions</dt>
	<dd>In business many decisions that involve the future are based at least partially on subjective probability. (What is the probability the new product will sell? What is the probability the exchange rate will stay under US$0.76 next year?)</dd>
