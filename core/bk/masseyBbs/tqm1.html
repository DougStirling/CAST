<p class="heading">Origins of TQM</p>
<p>Total Quality Management (or TQM for short) is an approach to management of organisations and processes that arose in the 1950s in response to the need for Japanese industry to rebuild after the Second World War.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s, Japan was still perceived as a producer of cheap wind-up toys and poor quality cameras. In the 1950s, Japanese industry widely adopted the principles of TQM and developed its methodology. This resulted in  rapid changes to the world's perception of Japanese products and their profitibility.</p>
<p>The prime mover in this area was the American statistician and consultant W. Edwards Deming who promoted the idea of continuous improvement in quality of products and services through statistical methods of monitoring and improving.  Together with others in this area such as Walter Shewhart, Joseph Juran and Kaoru Ishikawa he promoted a management philosophy which has been adopted widely and modified into newer methodologies such as the Six Sigma approach.</p>
<p class="heading">Importance of quality</p>
<p>The quality of a product or service depends on whether it satisfies the needs of its consumers. In many situations, quality depends on how closely it matches its detailed specifications. There is often a trade-off between quality and the short-term cost of production of a product or delivery of a service. However in the longer term,  quality improvements usually save money through increased sales and more efficient processes. Quality must always be a major focus.</p>
<p> Quality management refers to those parts of management processes which  affect quality, and hence total quality management is a philosophy which incorporates aspects of quality management into all management processes.</p>
<p>In this chapter our focus is on the statistical aspects of quality management, and in particular on the concept of statistical quality control through <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_controlBasics')">control charts</a>.  However we will firstly examine some basic aspects of TQM which incorporate or correspond to some basic statistical ideas.</p>
