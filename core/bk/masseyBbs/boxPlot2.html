<p class="heading">Five-number summary</p>

  <p>The distribution of values in many data sets can be effectively summarised 
		by a few numerical values called <strong>summary statistics</strong>. In this 
		section we describe a graphical display that is based on five summary statistics 
		called the <strong>5-number summary</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The two <strong>extremes</strong> of the batch (i.e. the minimum and maximum values).</li>
    <li>Three other values that split the batch into groups that contain (as closely 
      as possible) equal numbers of values (the <strong>lower quartile</strong>, 
      the <strong>median</strong> and the <strong>upper quartile</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Box plot</p>

<p>The <strong>box plot</strong> of a batch of values displays these five values 
	graphically. (It is sometimes called a <strong>box and whisker plot</strong>.)</p>


<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
<tr>
	<td bgcolor="#DDDFFF"><img class="gif" src="../../en/boxPlot/images/boxPlotValues.gif" width="362" height="427"></td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>A box plot therefore splits the data set into four quarters with (approximately) equal numbers
of values.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows a batch of values as a jittered dot plot and a box plot.

		<p><strong>Click</strong> on the different regions of the box plot to verify 
			that the box plot does indeed split the batch into quarters.</p>
		<p><strong>Drag</strong> over the central box (click on the left half of the 
			box and move the mouse to the right half with the button held down) to verify 
			that half the values are between the upper and lower quartiles.</p>

  <p class="heading">Details</p>
	<p>We have skipped over some details in our description of the median and quartiles. 
    The idea of splitting the data into 4 equal-sized 
    groups allows you to interpret the shape of box plots.</p>
	<p>For large data sets, you should usually rely on a computer to evaluate the median and quartiles, so a precise definition 
		is not strictly necessary. However for smaller data sets, you should be able to calculate them by hand.</p>
	<p class="heading">Definition of median</p>

<p>If there is an even number of values, any value between the middle two will 
	split the batch into two equal halves.</p>

<ul>
	  <li>The median, <i>m</i>, of an even number of values is defined to be the 
			average of the middle two values.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is an odd number of values, the batch cannot be split into two halves</p>

  <ul>
		<li>The median, <i>m</i>, of an odd number of values is defined to be the 
      middle value.</li>
	</ul>
	
<p class="heading">Definition of quartiles</p>

  <p>To define the lower quartile, we take all values lower than the median, <em>m</em>. 
		The lower quartile is the median of these values. Note that we always exclude the 
		median itself from this calculation even if there is an odd number of values in 
		the data set. The upper quartile is similarly defined as the median of the 
		upper half of the values.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Different authors give slightly different definitions 
					for the upper and lower quartiles.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Provided you are consistent with your definitions, the box plots that you 
		will draw should lead you to the same conclusions about the differences between 
	groups.</p>

	<p class="heading">Quartiles in Excel</p>
	<p>Note that Excel uses a slightly different procedure to calculate quartiles. In this paper, we will specify whether we wish you to find the quartiles by hand or by using the Excel function <strong>=quartile()</strong>. Instructions for using this function in Excel are given in the Study Guide.</p>
