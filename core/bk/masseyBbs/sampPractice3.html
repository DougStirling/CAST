<p class="heading">Sampling from large populations</p>

<p>Two-stage sampling is a sampling scheme that is related to cluster sampling, 
but is of most use for large populations when the individuals are very widely 
separated in some sense. For example, many polls are conducted to obtain <strong>national</strong> 
information about voting intentions or consumer purchases, and there is a high 
cost associated with travelling between different regions.</p>
<p>In two-stage sampling, the population is separated into groups of adjacent 
individuals called <strong>primary sampling units</strong>. These primary sampling 
units are typically large &mdash; for example a country might be split into 20 or more 
regions. A small number of these are selected according to some sampling scheme, 
then individuals are sub-sampled within each selected primary unit.</p>
<p>Costs are reduced by limiting sampling to a small number of primary units. 
For example, if individuals are only sampled from within say 5 regions, travelling 
and accommodation costs will be considerably reduced.</p>

<p>The diagram below is a small-scale illustration of two-stage sampling of 16 
values from a population of 128 individuals.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> to select all 16 primary sampling units 
and a sample of size 1 from each. This is identical to a stratified random sample.</p>
<p>Change the control <strong>Primary units sampled</strong> to 2 primary units. 
Click <strong>Take sample</strong> to randomly select two of the primary units, 
with all individuals in each unit being sampled. Since complete primary units 
are sampled, this extreme is identical to cluster sampling.</p>
<p>Finally, change the control to select either 4 or 8 primary units. Taking a 
sample now involves a random selection of primary units, followed by a random 
selection of individuals within each. Typically there are large numbers of individuals 
and primary units so random sampling is needed for both primary units and individuals 
within them.</p>
