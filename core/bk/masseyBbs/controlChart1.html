<p class="heading notPrinted">Introduction</p>
<p>In the previous section, we saw that collection and analysis of data to help analyse a problem usually suggests further questions for which further data are required. Several cycles of data collection and analysis are usually needed, with considerable input from an expert in the problem area between each cycle of the process.   In this section we focus on statistical tools which enable us to detect a problem before it gets too out of hand.</p>
<p class="heading">Detecting problems</p>
  <p>Problems in a process are usually detected by collecting and analysing <strong>data</strong> 
    about the performance of the system. Various different types of data can be 
    collected to throw light on the performance of a system. In this section, 
    we describe one particularly useful way to monitor processes. </p>
