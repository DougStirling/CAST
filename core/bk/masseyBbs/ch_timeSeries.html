<p>The values in many data sets are recorded sequentially in time. Examples are</p>

<ul>
    <li>Average monthly house price in a city over a period of 5 years</li>
    <li>Number of students enrolling at a university each year for the past 15 
      years</li>  
    <li>Strength of every 100th screwdriver manufactured during an 8-hour shift</li>  <li>Number of hospital admissions each day over a period of 5 months</li>
</ul>

  <p>In such time series data, there is often a time-related pattern to the variability. 
    This may be either a trend towards higher or lower values over time or a pattern 
    that repeats regularly. This aspect of overall variability may be <strong>explained</strong> 
    in terms of the time-ordering of the data. </p>

  <p>This chapter describes techniques to analyse patterns in time series and 
    to use these patterns to forecast future values.</p>
