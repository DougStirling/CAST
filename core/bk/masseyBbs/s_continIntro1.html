<p>For categorical and discrete numerical variables, it is reasonable to talk about
the probabilities of individual values, such as the probability of a success or of <em>X</em> = 0
breakdowns. However for continuous numerical variables, it no longer makes sense
to talk about the probabilities for individual values.</p>
<p>For example, the probability that an apple will weight <strong>exactly</strong> 60 gm
(and not 59.999 gm or 60.001 gm or ...) is zero. Instead we need to talk about the
probabilities that continuous variables are <strong>within ranges</strong>, such
as P(60 &lt; weight &lt; 70).</p>
<p>For a continuous probability distribution, probabilities are found as the area
under a curve called a “probability density function”.</p>
