<p class="heading">Shape of a probability density function</p>
	<p>A probability density function is usually a fairly smooth curve, though a
single sample histogram provides limited information about its likely shape.</p>

<p class="heading">Normal distributions</p>
<p>One flexible group of continuous probability density functions is the family
of <strong>normal distributions</strong>. Normal distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are symmetric.</li>
<li>Have a parameter called µ that is the mean of the population.</li>
<li> Have a parameter σ that is the population's standard deviation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changing the parameters µ and σ changes where the distribution is centred
and its spread, but its shape remains otherwise the same.</p>
<p>The parameters are often <strong>estimated</strong> from a sample. Details
will be given later, but the resulting normal pdf will be close in shape to a
histogram of the sample data.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../en/probDensity/images/s_bestFit.gif" width="404" height="202"></p>
<p>The sample data rarely gives enough information for us to be <strong>sure</strong> that the underlying population is  normal, but a normal model is often used unless there is <strong>obvious</strong> non-normality in the data.</p>
<p>Even if the sample data are obviously skew, a normal distribution may be a reasonable
model for a nonlinear transformation of the values (e.g. a log transformation).</p>
<p class="heading">Distribution of summary statistics</p>
	<p>A more important reason for the importance of the normal distribution in statistics 
		is that...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Many summary statistics have normal distributions (at least approximately).</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The Central Limit Theorem shows that the mean of a random sample has a distribution that is close to normal when the sample size is moderate or large, <strong>irrespective 
	of the shape of the distribution of the individual values</strong>. The following are also 
	approximately normal when the sample size is moderate or large...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A sample proportion</li>
		<li>The slope and intercept of a least squares line</li>
		<li>The difference between the means of two samples</li>
	<li>The difference between two proportions</li></ul>
