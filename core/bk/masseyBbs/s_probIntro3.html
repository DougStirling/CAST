<p class="heading">Long-term proportion</p>
<p>In many random situations, there are no equally likely outcomes, so the 'classical'
definition of probability must be generalised. In these situations, we define the
probability of an event to be the 'long-term' proportion of times that the event
would occur if <strong>similar</strong> data
were repeatedly collected.</p>

<p>The equivalence of this definition to the one on the previous page is called the <strong>law
of large numbers</strong>.</p>
