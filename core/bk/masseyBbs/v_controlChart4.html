<p class="heading">Additional triggers for an out-of-control process </p>

<p>The most commonly used indication of a process being out-of-control is a  
  value outside the upper and lower control limits (more than three standard deviations 
  away from the centre line). This is sensitive to changes to the process mean 
  or increases in the process variability. </p>

<p>However additional triggers have been proposed that are also sensitive to systematic
changes in a process. These are all based
on successive values within 1 standard deviation (Zone C), 2 standard deviations (Zone B)
or 3 standard deviations (Zone A) from the specified centre.

<p>The five most commonly used indications that a process is out of control
are described in the diagram below.</p>

<p>We only expect you to remember and use the <strong>first, fourth and fifth</strong> of these triggers in
this course, but also discuss the other two in the pages that follow.</p>
