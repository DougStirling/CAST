<p class="heading notPrinted">Reasons for variability</p>
	<p>Most statistical data sets contain measurements 
		 from a collection of 'individuals'. These individuals are not identical
so measurements  made from them also vary from individual to individual.</p>
<p>Even when the 'individuals' are very similar,  recorded measurements from 
them often vary due to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Variability of the environment in which the measurements were made</li>
		<li>Variability in the measurement procedure itself<br>
	</li>
	</ul>

<p class="heading">Explained and unexplained variation</p>


<p>In some data sets, we may be able to 'explain' some of the variation  in terms
of other known characteristics of the individuals. This helps us to understand
the data and is an important part of the information (signal) in it. The
remaining unexplained variation is  random 'noise'  that makes
it harder to detect the signal.</p>
