<p class=heading>Outliers</p>

  <p>The strength of the relationship between two variables is usually the most 
    important information that we gain from a scatterplot. Two other features 
    may however be apparent &mdash; if present, they often provide the most useful 
    information from the data. In this page we examine outliers and in the next, 
    clusters are discussed.</p>
	<p>Sometimes one cross on a scatterplot lies well away from the rest of the 
		scatter of points. Such an observation is called an <strong>outlier</strong>.</p>
	
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../en/relationship/images/outliers.gif" width="312" height="157"></p>
	
	<p>An outlier may be an extreme value of one or both variables and the outlier 
		may therefore be apparent in the marginal distributions of the variables.</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
	<tr>
		  <td valign="top"><p>However an individual may stand apart from the bulk of 
				the data in a scatterplot <strong>without being an extreme observation 
				for either variable on its own</strong>. Univariate displays of the separate 
				variables may not detect such an outlier.</p></td>

<p class=heading>Importance of outliers</p>

  <p>Outliers are features of a data set that <strong>must</strong> be carefully 
		checked. An outlier is often caused by a recording or transcription error, 
		so...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>First check that the values of the variables 
				are correctly recorded.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>Sometimes an outlier arises because an individual is fundamentally different 
    from the others. This may be important information and may point to a new 
    plant species, an employee who is performing poorly, a single mature student 
    in a class of teenagers, ...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The individuals should be further examined (perhaps 
				collecting further information from them) to try to assess whether the 
				outlier individual has distinct characteristics.</p>
</div></div>

  
	<p>An outlier that is either extreme or that has other distinctive characteristics 
		would often be deleted from the data set, but should be mentioned in a report 
		about the data. </p>

		<p>One house had an extremely high floor area &mdash; it stands out as an outlier 
      in the marginal distribution of floor area. From the relationship between 
      floor area and price of the other houses, we would <strong>also</strong> 
      have expected this house's sale price to have been higher, so it is an outlier 
      because the house does not follow the pattern that is evident in the rest 
      of the data.</p>
		<p>Ideally, we would try to find out what was special about the house. Was 
			it mis-classified as a house when it was really a commercial property or 
			block of apartments?</p>
		<p>However since no further information is available about this outlier, we 
			could omit it from further analysis. However in any reports we should state 
			that our conclusions are only valid for houses below 400 square metres.</p>
