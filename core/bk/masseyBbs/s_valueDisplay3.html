<p class="heading">Stacked dot plots</p>
<p>Stacked dot plots are related to stem and leaf plots, with the
vertical column of stems  replaced by a standard horizontal axis and the stacks
of leaves  replaced by stacks of crosses. The stacking again highlights regions
of high density effectively (tall stacks).</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stackedDotPlot.gif" alt="" width="400" height="150"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Some of the detailed information about the individual values in a stem and leaf
plot is lost, but this information is rarely important and the diagram shows the
distribution of values equally well.</p>
<p class="heading">Jittering the crosses</p>
<p>In a stacked dot plot, the grouping of crosses into stacks means that the crosses
cannot be drawn at exactly the correct position along the axis. An alternative to
stacking the crosses is to jitter them &mdash; draw them at exactly the correct position
along the axis but randomly move them away from it:</p>

</p>
<p>Note that the vertical jittering is random and therefore tells you nothing about
the data.</p>
