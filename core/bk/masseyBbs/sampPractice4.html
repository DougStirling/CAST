<p class="heading">Estimation</p>
<p>The aim of sampling is usually to <strong>estimate</strong> one or more population 
values (parameters) from a sample. Later chapters deal in depth with this issue 
of estimation, but we mention here that estimates such as sample means or proportions 
are random quantities. If we were to repeat the sampling process, the estimate 
would vary and this sample-to-sample variability can be described by a distribution 
(e.g. the distribution of the sample mean or sample proportion).</p>
<p>The estimate is not guaranteed to be the same as the value that we are estimating, 
so we call the difference the <strong>error</strong> in the estimate. There are 
different kinds of error.</p>
<p class="heading">Sampling error</p>
<p>We have presented four different ways to randomly sample from a population</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple random sample</li>
<li>Stratified sample</li>
<li>Cluster sample</li>
<li>Two-stage sample</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these involves randomness in the sample-selection process, so the estimated 
mean or proportion is unlikely to be exactly the same as the underlying population 
parameter that is being estimated. This kind of error is called <strong>sampling 
error</strong>.</p>
<p>When sampling books from a library or sacks of rice from the output of a factory, 
sampling error is the main or only type of error.</p>
<p class="heading">Non-sampling error</p>

<p>When sampling from some types of population &mdash; especially human populations 
&mdash; problems often arise when conducting one of the above sampling schemes. For 
example, some sampled people are likely to refuse to participate in your study.</p>
<p>Such difficulties also result in errors and these are called <strong>non-sampling 
errors</strong>. Non-sampling errors can be much more serious than sampling errors.</p>
<ul>
  
<li>Unlike sampling errors, the likely size of non-sampling errors cannot be estimated 
from a single sample &mdash; it is extremely difficult to assess their likely size.</li>
  <li>Non-sampling errors often distort estimates by pulling them in one direction. 
  The estimates are then called <strong>biased</strong>. (Sampling errors do not
  cause estimates to be <strong>consistently</strong> low or high.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is therefore important to design a survey to minimise the risk of non-sampling 
errors. The following pages discuss various types of non-sampling error. </p>
