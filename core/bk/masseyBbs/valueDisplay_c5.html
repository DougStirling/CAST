<p class="heading">Stem and leaf plots</p>
<p>With anything more than a very small data set sampling ordering the data is insufficient to enable to gain much insight into the data.&nbsp; A <strong>stem and leaf plot </strong>orders the data and then groups (or stacks) it according to the leading digit (or digits).</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>If you have not met stem and leaf plots before, we recommend you scroll down and look at the example before reading the detail on how they are constructed.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Note the following for the layout of a stem and leaf plot.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The 'axis' is drawn vertically.</li>
	<li>A value is printed on the axis for each class (stack) giving the most significant digits that are common for all values on that stack.&nbsp; This is called the <strong>stem</strong> for that class.</li>
	<li>The digits representing the values are called the <strong>leaf</strong> digits and are written in a row to the right of the stems.&nbsp; Note that each data value can only have 1 leaf digit; other digits are usually 'ignored' (that is, the values are truncated) â€“ see the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('valueDisplay6')">Human Resources Managers Salaries example</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The layout of a stem and leaf plot makes it particularly easy to read off the 
	values that the leaves represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing the digit displayed for any value (called its <strong>leaf</strong> 
digit) after the stack's stem digits gives the most significant digits of the 
value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The format is most easily understood with an example.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>Note that CAST draws stem and leaf plots with the smallest stem at the bottom. You may have been taught to draw them with the smallest stem at the top. Either ordering is acceptable.</p>

company to respond to 20 telephoned queries about an accounting package that it 
sells.</p>

<p>Click on any leaf in the plot (a black digit). The corresponding data value 
is shown above the plot.</p>
<p>Observe that the stem is the 'tens' digit of the value and the leaf is its 
'units' digit. </p>
