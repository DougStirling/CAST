<p class="heading">Crosses instead of digits</p>
<p>In stem and leaf plots, the leaf digits provide  information about the precise values that they represent. For most data sets, this detailed information does not help us to understand the distribution of values &mdash; we would get the same impression if the leaf digits were replaced by crosses. Such a graphical display is called a <strong>stacked dot plot</strong>.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Nursing home residents</p>
<p>You are interested in establishing a nursing home for retired people in the 
USA. Where should it be sited? Information about current nursing home usage in 
the different states would be useful.</p>
<p>The diagram below is based on a stem and leaf plot of the number per 500 population aged 65 or more 
who are nursing home residents in each state. The stem 'axis' has been drawn horizontally and displayed in the more conventional form.</p>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> with the mouse over the leaves to discover the names 
of the states. Note that all leaves in the same column have the same 'units' digits (i.e. stem digits).</p>
<p>Select <strong>Crosses</strong> from the pop-up menu to display the data as a stacked dot plot.</p>
<p class="gray">(Unfortunately <strong>neither</strong> display directly 
helps your decision on where to site the new nursing home. Should you pick the 
state with the lowest number of nursing home residents since there is a lack of 
facilities? Or would that be the worst choice since elderly people in the state 
do not seem to like using nursing homes? Further information is needed!)</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">Stacked  dot plots</p>

<p>Although the use of crosses instead of digits removes some detailed information about the values in a data set, stacked dot plots are more flexible than stem and leaf plots. When a computer draws a stacked dot plot, the stacks are determined only by the  size of the crosses used in the plot and may not be 'neat' widths.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>For practical data analysis, a stacked dot plot usually displays as much information as a stem and leaf plot.</p>

<p class="heading">Survival time of businesses that failed in the previous year</p>
<p>A researcher is interested in how long small businesses stay in operation. 
As part of the study, 120 businesses that closed down during the previous year 
were investigated. The last registered director of each company was contacted 
and asked about how long it had been in business. (The information was obtained 
from local government sources if nobody from the company could be contacted.)</p>
<p>The stacked dot plot below shows the ages of the 120 businesses.</p>

<p>Use the pop-up menu to change the size of the crosses in the diagram. As the crosses get smaller,</p>
<ul>
	<li>The number of stacks increases.</li>
	<li>The position of each cross on the axis reflects the exact value more accurately.</li>
	<li>The display becomes more jagged.</li>
</ul>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The stacked dot plot with large crosses displays information about the distribution of 'years in business' as well as that with smaller crosses.	</div></div>

<p class="heading">Jittered dot plots</p>
<p>An alternative to stacking crosses in a dot plot is to position each cross at <strong>exactly</strong> the position of the value along the axis. This is often adequate for small data sets, but in larger data sets,
	the crosses will overlap.</p>
<p>An alternative solution to stacking of crosses is to <strong>randomly</strong>  move the crosses perpendicularly to the axis in order
	to separate them somewhat. This is called <strong>jittering</strong> the points.</p>
<p class="gray">(You should rely on a computer to do the jittering for 
	you, but it could be done by hand by rolling a 6- or 10-sided die for each 
	cross to determine its jittering in millimetres.)</p>

	<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider to jitter the points. <strong>Click</strong> the button on the right to change the jittering &mdash; i.e. to change the random 
		vertical position of the crosses.</p>
	<p>Only enough jittering should be used to separate the high density of crosses &mdash; 
		moving the slider about half way is best for the data above. Without jittering,
		too many crosses overlap to allow us to assess the distribution of values.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Note that the vertical positions of the crosses have no importance
