<p>Stratified, cluster and two-stage sampling schemes have various advantages
and disadvantages, compared to a sample random sample that records information
from the same number of individuals.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Stratified sampling</dt>
<dd>A stratified random sample provides more accurate estimates of population
characteristics than a simple random sample of the same size from the population.
The advantage of stratified sampling is greatest when the strata differ in their
mean value of the characteristic.</dd>
<dt>Cluster sampling</dt>
<dd>As mentioned earlier, it is usually much cheaper to obtain information from
individuals in clusters than from the same number of individuals in a simple
random sample. However the penalty is that the mean population characteristic
is less accurately estimated.</dd>
<dt>Two-stage sampling</dt>
<dd>As with cluster sampling, two-stage sampling has lower cost than simple random
sampling but usually estimates population characteristics less accurately.</dd>
