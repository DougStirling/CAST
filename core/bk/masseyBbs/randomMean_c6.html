<p class="heading">Need for multiple values to assess variability</p>

  <p>In most situations, we need to make two or more measurements of a variable 
		to get any information about its variability. For example, a sample of size 
		two or more is needed to calculate the sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>.</p>
	<p>A single value contains no information about the quantity's variability.</p>
	<p class="heading">Achieving the impossible?</p>
	<p>It would appear necessary to record several sample means (from different 
		random samples) before we could obtain an estimate of the standard deviation 
		of the sample mean.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In practice, we rarely have the luxury of repeated 
					samples, so how can we assess the variability of a sample mean on the 
					basis of a single sample?</p>
</div></div>
<p>Fortunately, we do not need multiple samples to do this. We can estimate 
		the standard deviation of the sample mean from a <strong>single sample</strong>, 
	based on the equations</p>
	<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position:relative; top:12px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline"></span></p>

<p>We can use the sample  standard deviation, <em>s</em>, 
in this equations as an estimate of σ. Thus from a single sample we can get an estimate of µ (<img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">) and an estimate of the standard deviation of <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">,</p>

<p class=heading>Examples</p>
		<p>In the examples below, the data are used to find an estimate of the  
			population mean &mdash; our best guess is the sample 
			mean.</p>
		<p>The sample mean will be approximately normal and its standard deviation 
			can be estimated using the sample standard deviation.</p>

		<p>Note that the last two data sets are probably not from normal populations 
			&mdash; they seem a bit skew. However the sample means will still be approximately 
			normal. </p>
