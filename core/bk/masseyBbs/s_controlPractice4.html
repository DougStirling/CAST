<p class="heading">Attributes and defects</p>
<p>A <strong>p-chart</strong> is used to monitor the proportion of process output
that has a certain attribute, such as the proportion of items with defects.</p>
<p>If  <em>x</em> items in a sample of size <em>n</em> have the attribute, then <em>x</em> has
a binomial distribution and the
sample proportion<em> p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em><sup>x</sup></em>/<em><sub>n</sub></em> has
mean and standard deviation:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/propnMeanSd.gif" width="230" height="42"></p>
<p>where π is the population proportion.</p>
<p class="heading">Control limits</p>
<p>As in other control charts, the control limits are given by the mean ± three standard
deviations,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/propnPlusMinus.gif" width="134" height="44"></p>
<p>Since π is unknown, it is estimated from a training period in which the process
is in control. If defective proportions <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>,
…, <em>p<sub>k</sub></em> are observed in <em>k</em> samples of size <em>n</em>,
our best estimate is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/propnEstimate.gif" width="72" height="58"></p>
<p> and the control limits  are therefore</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/propnLimits.gif" width="165" height="92"></p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>In a training period, it was observed that 4% of orders were incorrectly processed.
A control chart for the proportion of incorrectly processed orders in samples of
<em>n</em> = 20 orders has control limits</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/defectivePropnLimits.gif" width="255" height="94"></p>
<p>Since a proportion must always lie between 0 and 1, this means that the lower
control limit is <strong>effectively</strong> equal to 0.</p>
<p>A p-chart for eight further samples of <em>n</em> = 20 orders is shown below:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/defectiveChart.gif" width="546" height="268" class="summaryPict"></p>
<p>On day 7 the proportion of incorrectly processed orders (<sup>4</sup>/<sub>20</sub> =
0.2)  exceeds the upper control limit, the process is out
of control and should be investigated for special causes.</p>
