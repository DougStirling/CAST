<p class="heading">Primary and secondary data</p>
<p>When data are collected specifically to answer your question of interest,
they are called <strong>primary data</strong>. Primary data may be collected
via a designed experiment or an observational study such as a survey.</p>
<p>Data that are collected by somebody else for another purpose are called <strong>secondary
data</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Types of primary data collection</p>
	<p>In an <strong>observational study</strong>, we passively 
		record (observe) values from each unit. Usually these units are sampled from some population.</p>
	<p>In an <strong>experiment</strong>, the researcher actively changes some characteristics 
		of the units before the data are collected. The values of some variables are therefore <strong>under the control of the experimenter</strong>. In other words, the experimenter 
		is able to <strong>choose</strong> each individual's values for some variables.</p>
