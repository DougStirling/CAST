<p class="heading">Descriptive and inferential statistics</p>
<p>Data sets can be summarised with graphs, tables and summary statistics, methods
that are collectively called <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>.</p>
<p>We are often interested in some population of values but
cannot obtain  information about all values because of cost or other practical
constraints. Data are  collected from a <strong>sample</strong> of individuals and are
used to throw light on the characteristics of the underlying population. Using sample
information to find information about a population is called <strong>inferential
statistics</strong>.</p>
<p>Samples are usually random &mdash; different values would be recorded if a new sample
was taken from the population &mdash; and the resulting uncertainty about the conclusions
that are drawn are described in terms of <strong>probability</strong>.</p>
