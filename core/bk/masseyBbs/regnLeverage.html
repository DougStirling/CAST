<p class="heading">Problems with residuals as indicators of outliers</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data points that do not fit the pattern displayed in most of the data do not always have large residuals (or standardised residuals). This is because all data points pull the least squares line towards themselves, since the line is positioned to minimise the sum of squares of the residuals</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="bold black">minimise</span>  &nbsp; <img class="gif" src="../../en/regnProblem/images/minResidSsq.gif" width="37" height="20"></p>
<p>Large residuals pull very strongly on the line since they are squared in the least squares criterion. As a result,</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Unusual points strongly pull the least squares line towards themselves, making their residuals smaller than you might otherwise expect.</p>
</div></div>
<p>This effect is strongest when the x-value of a point is very large or small. These points are said to have more <strong>leverage</strong> on the position of the line.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>If an outlier corresponds to a high-leverage point, its residual may 
		therefore still be small.</p>
</div></div>
<p>You can experiment with this effect in the following applet.</p>

<p class="heading">Illustration</p>
<p>The scatterplot below shows a data set and the corresponding residuals.</p>

<p>The cross on the far right can be dragged with the mouse. Initially, the diagram 
shows what we would ideally have <span class="darkred bold">hoped</span>  
to see in the residuals &mdash; the other points are close to a straight line, so if 
the final cross is dragged away from this line, we would have <span class="bold darkred">hoped</span>  
that it would result in a large residual.</p>
<p><span class="darkred bold">This is not what actually happens.</span>  
Choose <strong>What you actually get...</strong> from the pop-up menu at the top 
and drag the point again. The least squares line is pulled towards the point, 
so when it is dragged away from the line followed by the other points, its residual 
is smaller than might be expected and the residuals for the other points are larger.</p>
<p>This is especially evident when the point being dragged has an x-value of around 
4 &mdash; i.e. when it is a high leverage point. Drag it down to a y-value of about 
40 and observe that its residual is no more extreme than those of the other points.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Do not rely on an extreme residual to tell you whether a high-leverage 
		point is an outlier.</p>
