<p class="heading">Does the response depend on X?</p>
<p>In a normal linear model, the response has a distribution whose mean,
	µ<sub>y</sub>,
	depends linearly on the explanatory variable,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>Y</em>&nbsp; ~ &nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">normal</font> (&mu;<sub>y</sub>&nbsp;, &sigma;<sub>y</sub>)</span></p>
<p>If the slope parameter, β<sub>1</sub>, 
	is zero, then the response has a normal distribution that does not depend on <i>X</i>.</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>Y</em> &nbsp; ~ &nbsp; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">normal</font> (&beta;<sub>0</sub> , &nbsp;&sigma;)</span></p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>If the slope is zero, there is <span class="red">no association</span> between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Testing for zero slope</p>

<p>To assess whether the explanatory variable affects the response, we test the 
  hypotheses </p>
<p class=eqn><span class="blue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&beta;<sub>1</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0<br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&beta;<sub>1</sub>  &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;  0</span> </p>
<p>The least squares slope from a sample, <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>, 
  is the obvious statistic to throw light on the value of β<sub>1</sub>, 
  but <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> varies from sample to sample. We must therefore take account of its sampling distribution
  to assess its distance from zero. </p>
<p class="heading">Software output</p>
<p>You will rely on computer software to perform the test for zero slope. We will first describe the typical output from such a test, then give a partial explanation about the information in the output. Most software provides regression output in the same format. Typical output from fitting a regression model to <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;20 observations that use an explanatory variable &quot;Advertising&quot; to predict the response &quot;Sales&quot; is shown below.</p>

<p class="heading">Interpretation of p-value</p>
<p>The p-value for a test of zero slope is interpreted in the same way as for other hypothesis tests. The table below may be regarded as an over-simplification, can be used as a guide. </p>


	<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
<tr>
			<th align="CENTER">p-value</th>
			<th align="CENTER">Interpretation</th>
		</tr>
		<tr bgcolor="white">
			<td style="border-top:1px solid #999999;">over 0.1</td>
			<td style="border-top:1px solid #999999;">no evidence that the null hypothesis does not hold<br>
				(no evidence that the slope is non-zero)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr bgcolor="white">
			<td>between 0.05 and 0.1</td>
			<td>very weak evidence that the null hypothesis does not hold<br>
				(very weak evidence that the slope is non-zero)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr bgcolor="white">
			<td>between 0.01 and 0.05</td>
			<td>moderately strong evidence that the null hypothesis does not hold<br>
(moderately strong evidence that the slope is non-zero)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr bgcolor="white">
			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">under 0.01</td>
			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">strong evidence that the null hypothesis does not hold<br>

<p>Consider a data set with least squares slope <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> and corresponding p-value,   0.0023. We should conclude that there is strong 
	evidence that the linear model slope is not zero and therefore that the response 
	is related to the explanatory variable. </p>
<p>Similarly, if we calculate that the p-value for <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> is 0.4, this tells us that a least squares slope as far from zero as <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> would not be unusual if <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> were unrelated. Our conclusion should be that there is no reason to doubt the null hypothesis &mdash;  there is no evidence of a relationship 
	between the response and explanatory variables. </p>
