<p class="heading">Primary and secondary  data</p>
<p>When data are collected specifically to answer your question of interest, they are called <strong>primary data</strong>. Primary data may be collected via a designed experiment or an observational study such as a survey.</p>
<p>Data that are collected by somebody else for another purpose are called <strong>secondary data</strong>.  The abundant data available on the internet is the most often used example of this.</p>

<p class="heading">Individuals / units</p>
<p>Most data sets consist of one or more values that are recorded from each of 
a set of individuals (or plants, plots of land, repetitions of an experiment or 
other 'units'). These individuals will vary in many ways other than the variables 
that are recorded.</p>
<p>There are two different ways in which data can be collected from these units.</p>
