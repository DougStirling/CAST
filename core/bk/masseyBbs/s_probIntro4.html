<p class="heading">Empirical probability</p>
<p>Defining the probability of an event as the limiting proportion of times the
event occurs when more and more data are collected 
is not a practical way to determine its value. In practice, we must <strong>estimate</strong> such
probabilities from a finite number of repetitions, giving an <strong>empirical probability</strong>.</p>
<p>We can use empirical probabilities   in a similar way to exact theoretical
probabilities.</p>
<p class="heading">Subjective probability</p>
<p>If it is difficult to imagine repeatedly collecting
similar data, the earlier definitions cannot be used. Any definition of probability
for such situations involves some personal judgement and is therefore called a <strong>subjective
probability</strong>.</p>
<p>Different people are likely to allocate different values for subjective probabilities,
and they are not discussed further in this e-book.</p>
