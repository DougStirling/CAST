<p class="heading">Prediction</p>
	<p>Typically, we are interested in predicting the value of one variable from another. Consider the following two scenarios:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Predicting electricity demand for a single household based on the outdoor temperature during winter.</li>
		<li>Predicting the selling price of a house from the tax valuation.</li>
	</ol>
<p>In the first case, the relationship is causal &mdash; when the temperature decreases, people turn on the heat, increasing the demand for electricity. In the second case, the relationship is not causal. The selling price is ‘caused’ by buyer demand for that neighbourhood, the size of the house and lot, and other attributes of the house. The valuation is ‘caused’ by many of the same variables, perhaps at an earlier point in time. However, the ultimate selling price is not available when a house goes on the market, but the valuation is, so we might like to use the valuation to predict the price.</p>
<p>However, in both situations we would like to predict one variable from another. The variable we would like to predict is called the <strong>response variable</strong>; the information we will use to do the prediction is the <strong>explanatory variable</strong>. When we talk in general about this type of data we will use the letter <em>X</em> to denote the explanatory variable, and <em>Y</em> to denote the response.	</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Always draw the response variable, <i>Y</i>, on the vertical 
        axis of a scatterplot and <i>X</i> on the horizontal axis.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Linear equations</p>
  <p>A straight line is an adequate description of many bivariate data sets. When used this way, a straight line is called a <strong>linear model</strong> or <strong>linear regression model</strong>. A straight line corresponds to an equation of the form:</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>y</em> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>b</em><sub>1 </sub><em>x</em></span></p>

  <p>The constant <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> 
    is called the <strong>intercept</strong> of the line and describes the y-value 
    when the x-value is zero. The constant <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> is called the line's <strong>slope</strong>; it 
    describes the change in <i>y</i> when <i>x</i> increases by one.</p>
  <p class="heading">Linear model and correlation coefficient</p>
  <p>The linear model and correlation coefficient describe different aspects of the relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>The correlation coefficient tells us how closely a line model fits the data, but it does not describe what the line is.</p>
</div></div>
  <p>However the correlation and the slope will always have the same sign.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Intercept and slope</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the meaning of a line's slope and intercept.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="400" height="400">

		<p>Drag the two red arrows up and down to adust the values of the slope and 
			intercept. Observe how the coloured arrows on the diagram are related to 
			the parameter values. </p>

<p>You may be familiar with the equation of a straight line from your previous mathematics schooling. If not, or if you would like to refresh your memory, there are two exercises at the end of this section in which you are asked to <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('e_leastSqrs2')">sketch a line from its equation</a> and to <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('e_leastSqrs3')">find the equation of a line from its graph</a>.</p>
