<p class="heading">Statistics and parameters</p>
<p>The earlier pages in this section have introduced summary statistics that describe the centre and spread of sample data. These are called <strong>sample statistics</strong>.</p>
<p>Corresponding summaries can  be obtained from the population from which the samples are selected and are called <strong>population parameters</strong>. However  we use different symbols and, in the case of the population standard deviation, a slightly different formula.</p>
<dl>
	<dt><span class="heading">Population size</span></dt>
	<dd>The symbol for the population size is <em>N</em> (as opposed to the lower-case <em>n</em> that is used for the sample size).</dd>
	<dt><span class="heading">Population mean</span></dt>
	<dd>The symbol for the population mean is µ	(this is a Greek letter and pronounced ‘mu’)  so  the formula for the population mean becomes</dd>
</dl>

<dl>	<dt><span class="heading">Population standard deviation</span></dt>
	<dd>The symbol for the population standard deviation is another Greek letter σ (sigma).
The formula for calculating σ is given below; note that we divide by <em>N</em> whereas
for <em>s</em> (the sample standard deviation) we divide by (<em>n</em> &minus; 1).</dd>

<p>Note that we do not expect you to remember these formula but you do need recognize the symbols µ and σ and that they refer to the population mean and standard deviation. </p>
