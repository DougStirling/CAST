<p>In data sets with only a single variable — a single measurement from each individual (or unit) — the best prediction of another individual's value would be the sample mean.</p>
  <p>If we have more information about each individual — a data matrix with more than one variable — then we might be able to use the values of these extra variables to get a more accurate prediction. For example, a person's age, gender and years of education, might be used to predict that person's income.</p>
  <p>This chapter presents methods for  predicting the value of one variable from  known values 
of the others.</p>
  <p class="heading">What you need to know</p>
	<p>This section of the course is examined by a question in the third assignment and two questions in the final exam — one about regression models involving a single explanatory variable and one about multiple regression.</p>
