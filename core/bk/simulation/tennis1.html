<p class="heading">Tennis</p>

<p>A simple model for a tennis match between two players, A and B, is easily described.
We assume that the probability of A winning any point is
π<sub>1</sub>
if A serves and
π<sub>2</sub>
if B serves, and that the results of successive points are independent. These assumptions,
plus the rules of tennis, constitute our model.
</p>

<p>This model could be used to randomly generate a complete tennis match.
For each successive point, a weighted coin with
P(head)&nbsp;=&nbsp;π<sub>1</sub>
could be tossed when A is serving, and A would win the point if the coin showed a
head. A different weighted coin with
P(head)&nbsp;=&nbsp;π<sub>2</sub>
would be used when B is serving. Repeating until one player wins gives
a <strong>simulation</strong> of the match.</p>

<p class="heading">Simulations on a computer</p>

<p>Computers cannnot perform truely random tasks, so computer-based simulations
are based on <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('random1')">pseudo-random</a> numbers. These are found with a deterministic
algorithm (a mathematical formula) that would generate identical events if it was repeated. However a good enough
algorithm generates a sequence of values that would be extremely difficult to
distinguish from a sequence of truely random values.
</p>

<p>For our tennis match simulation, the results
are essentially equivalent to those obtained by tossing coins.
</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram below shows how randomly generating points can simulate a complete
women's tennis match with 3 sets.

<p>Initially, both players are equally matched and have probability 0.75 of winning
their serves. Click <strong>Simulate Next Point</strong> to
play a single point of the match
-- the computer randomly generates a result, based on the probability of the
server winning the point. Click this button repeatedly to generate points until the
match is completed.
</p>

<p>Click <strong>Start New Match</strong> to perform another
simulation. Note that the
precise sequence of points is unlikely to be repeated exactly in different simulations,
even when the probabilities are the same in successive matches. (Before performing further
simulations, you may use the sliders to adjust the probabilities winning individual points
for the two competitors.)
</p>

</div>

<p>In practice, we would rarely be interested in displaying as much detail in a simulation
(except perhaps when checking that we have programmed the rules of the match properly!).
We are usually interested in only one or two characteristics of a match (e.g. the winner's
name or the total number of sets played in the match) and only these summaries need
be displayed.
</p>

<p>We will use a different sport to show how simulations are used to find useful information.
