<p class="heading">Handicaps in Golf
</p>

<p>In amature golf tournaments, competitors often have greatly varying abilities,
so the better players are 'handicapped' relative to the poorer players to reduce their
chances of winning. Does handicapping give all players the same chance of winning the
tournament if they play better than usual?
</p>

<p>We will next examine how effectively handicapping can achieve this goal.</p>

<p class="heading">Handicapping Based on Mean Score
</p>

<p>We initially assume that any golfer's handicap is the difference between that
golfer's expected score on
a par-70 course and 70. If a golfer's handicap is subtracted from his or her score, the
handicapped score should therefore have a distribution with mean 70 on a par-70 course.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram below shows how the distribution of the handicapped scores all have
	mean 70, irrespective of the ability level of the golfer (i.e. the mean raw score). </p>

<p>Drag the slider to see the distribution of
handicapped scores for different golfers.
Note that the poorer golfers are more variable, so their handicapped scores have
normal distributions with greater spread.
</p>

<p>Click on the diagram above 70 on the axis. (Again drag to
the left or right to get exactly 70.)
Observe that all players have the same probability of getting a handicapped
score of 70 or less &mdash; exactly 0.5.
