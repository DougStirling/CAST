<p class="heading">Does the model really fit the data?</p>

<p>Our model can explain the decrease in <strong>expected</strong> winning times 
  for the 1500m race in the Olympics over the last century, but do the actual 
  winning times <strong>really</strong> match what is predicted by the model?</p>
<p>Did you notice that the winning times that we simulated in the previous page 
  seemed to fluctuate more than the real winning times? </p>

<p>To answer this question, we must pick a summary statistic that is likely to 
  behave differently if the model really does implies that the variation will 
  be too high. </p>

<p class="heading">Number of records</p>
<p>If there has been an improvement in abilities over the century, on top of the 
  increasing pool of potential competitors, we would expect a higher number of 
  Olympic records.</p>
<p>In real life, a new record was set on 15 occasions. (Strictly, Olympic records 
  can be set in heats as well as in the final, but we will only treat performances 
  in the final as being elligible for records here!) What would be the chance 
  of getting as many records if our model of a constant underlying population 
  distribution was true?</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The simulation below helps to answer this question. </p>

</div>

<p>The number of records is displayed on the right of the diagram.
Click <strong>Faster Algorithm</strong>
and <strong>Accumulate</strong>,
then click <strong>Take sample</strong> several times to build up the sampling distribution
of the number of records. Take about 100 samples.
</p>

<p>You should observe that there would be virtually no chance of getting as many as
15 records if our model actually held.
</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">Conclusion</p>
<p>We can therefore conclude that the assumption of an unchanging underlying population 
  does <strong>not</strong> seem to be justified &mdash; there must have also been 
  an improvement in training and methodology over the last century. </p>

<p><font color="gray">(This last conclusion is not affected by the distribution that
we assumed for speeds in the underlying population &mdash; normal with mean 458 seconds and
standard deviation 50 seconds. Whatever the shape of the population distribution,
<a href="javascript:showNamedPage('orderStats2')">the distribution of the number of records is the same</a>.)</font>

<div class="boxed"><p>Simulations can provide useful information about a process that would be very
difficult to obtain by analytic means.</p></div>
