<p class="heading">Why have winning times improved?</p>

<p>The most commonly held explanation for the improvement in gold medal performances
is that training programmes for athletes have themselves improved and intensified.
</p>

<p>However there is a second reason why the gold medal performances have
improved. In the first dozen or so modern Olympic Games, there was a small
pool of people who were wealthy enough to train and compete, whereas in more recent
games a far greater proportion of the world's population would be trained and sent
if they exhibited potential in their sport.
</p>

<p class="heading">A model for the improvement in winning times</p>
<p>The consequence of the increasing pool of potential competitors for the winning 
  performance is demonstrated below. We assume that a characteristic in the world 
population has a normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 2.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram shows the abilities of a sample of 100 people from this population. 
	The ability of the best person in the sample (the winner!) is shown at the bottom. </p>
<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="500" height="350">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="sportProg.SampleMinApplet">
<param name="varName" value="Sample data">
<param name="random" value="20 12 2 6877052 4.5">
<param name="dataDecimals" value="2">
<param name="meanName" value="Sample minimum">
<param name="horizAxis" value="2 22 2 2">
<param name="sampleSize" value="10 *100 1000 10000">
</applet>
</div>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then 
click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to build up the distribution of
the winner's ability.
</p>

<p>Now repeat with sample sizes of 1,000 and 10,000
and observe that the 'winner' usually has a lower value when the sample size is higher.
</p>

<p>We therefore expect that the winning time in the 1500 metres at the Olympics will
decrease as the population from which the competitors are chosen increases, even if
the underlying population distribution of 'abilities' remains the same.
