<p class="heading">Simulations can take a long time
</p>

<p>To simulate many real-life processes, millions of random numbers must be generated.
For example, in a detailed simulation of a yachting match-race, we might randomly
generate changes to the weather, crew performance and tactics every 10 seconds during
the race.
</p>

<p class="heading">Simplifying the tennis simulation
</p>

<p>A little thought (and probabilit theory!) can greatly reduce the time it takes
to perform simulations.
</p>

<p>Our initial tennis simulation generated a
complete match between two players. From several simulated matches, we estimated
the <strong>probability</strong> that Player A wins a match. We will show next that we only
need to simulate the probability of winning a single game &mdash; the probability of winning the
complete match can be deduced from this.
</p>

<p class="heading">Probability of winning match from probability of winning game
</p>

<p>Firstly, we can deduce from the rules of tennis that there is no advantage
in serving first &mdash; in any set, either both players serve in the same number of
games (i.e. the total number of games is even, such as 6:4, 6:6 or 4:6) or the winning margin is high enough that the result
would have been the same had the set been
continued to an even number of games. (If there is a tie-break, we can
similarly argue that both players serve the same number of points in it.)
Therefore Player A has the same probability of winning each set in a match, irrespective
of which player serves first.
</p>

<p>If the probability that Player A wins any set is
π,
then we can list the possible sequence of sets result in Player A winning the match
(AA, ABA and BAA for a women's match) and add up their probabilities.
</p>

<p class=eqn>
<img src="images/pWinMatch.gif" width="412" height="52" alt="p(A win)=pi*pi*(3-2pi)">
</p>

<p><strong>We therefore only need to simulate individual sets to estimate
π,
not complete matches.</strong> The probability of winning a match can be easily estimated from
this.
</p>

<p class="heading">Equally matched players
</p>

<p>If both players have the <strong>same</strong> probability of winning any point that
they serve, we can further reason that each has
the same probability of winning each set (since they serve the same number of games) and
hence both have probability 0.5 of winning the match. (This does not require
<strong>any</strong> simulations at all!)
</p>

<p><font color='gray'>(In the tennis example, it is possible to avoid simulations
completely and find the probability of winning a set explicitly in terms of the
probabilities of winning individual points. This needs a considerable amount of careful
calculation however!!)</font>
