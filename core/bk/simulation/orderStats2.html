<p>Our simulations of winning times in the 1500 metres race in the
Olympic games were based on a model with a large underlying population of
'potential' competitors whose capabilities (the fastest time that they could run 1500 metres
with training) were normally distributed. How much do our conclusions depend on the
shape of this population distribution? Since we have collected no information
about its shape, the upper tail could be far from normal.
</p>

<p>We will show that the results of the simulation are only affected by
the shape of the lowest part of the left tail of the population distribution &mdash; the rest of the distribution
could be any shape without affecting our simulation results.
</p>


<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram below shows a normal model for a population of capabilities
(µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;458&nbsp;sec
and σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;50&nbsp;sec).
The cumulative distribution function, F(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;P(X&nbsp;<img src="images/le.gif" width="8" height="10" align="BASELINE" alt="<=">&nbsp;x), is also
drawn in black.
</p>

<p>The diagram also shows how ten pseudo-random values from this distribution
(horizontal dot plot) are generated from ten rectangularly distributed values
(vertical dot plot). The winning speed is highlighted in red.

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times and verify that the winning
time is usually in the lower half of the population distribution (under 458 sec).
</p>

<p>Use the slider to modify the shape of the upper tail of the population distribution.
Observe that race times under 458 (and therefore the winning time) are unaffected.
</p>

<p>Use the pop-up menu to increase the sample size and take a few more samples.
When the sample size increases, the minimum tends to be further into the left
tail of the distribution. As a result, the distribution of the minimum of large
samples is only affected by the shape of the extreme left tail of the population
distribution.
</p>

<p>Since the sample sizes in our simulation are large, our conclusions would not
be affected if we made different assumptions about the shape of the main part of the
population distribution.
</p>

<p><font color="#666666">(The simulation results are however dependent on the
shape of the extreme left tail of the population distribution. Our assumption
of normality does constrain the shape of the left tail so our results are
not completely independent of the shape of the population distribution.)</font>
