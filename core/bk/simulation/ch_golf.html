<p class="heading">Simulations with random numbers</p>
<p>The tennis and soccer league simulations were expressed in terms of categorical 
  random variables &mdash; we generated a series of wins, losses and draws, based on 
probabilities that were built into our models. </p>

<p>Other models must be expressed in terms of <strong>numerical</strong> random 
	variables that are characterised by probability distributions. Running simulations 
	of these models therefore involves generating random values for these numerical 
	variables from their probability distribution. </p>

<p>(A little more explanation about <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('random3')">generating numerical random values</a> will be given later.)</p>

<p>We illustrate using a different sport, golf. </p>
