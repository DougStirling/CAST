<p class="heading">Is there any evidence of skill?
</p>

<p>The variability in the league tables in the previous simulation leads us
to question whether placings at the end of the 1999/2000 English soccer season
might be simply caused by chance results from evenly matched teams.
</p>

<p>If teams have different skill levels, and therefore
different probabilities of winning, then there will be more variability in the final
points in the table than if all teams are evenly matched. (The difference between the
points won by the best and worst teams will be greater.) In the diagram below,
we therefore investigate measures of spread in the simulated league tables.
</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>We again assume equally matched teams with P(draw)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.2.

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then click <strong>Run League</strong> several times
to simulate a few seasons. The diagram shows a jittered dot plot of the range of points
in the league table (maximum minus minimum). This jittered dot plot shows how large the
range is likely to be if all teams are equally matched.

<p class="heading">English Premier Soccer League in 1999/2000
</p>

<p>In the 1999/2000 season, the top team got
91 point and the bottom team got 24 points, a range of 67 points. From the simulation,
a range of 67 points seems extremely unlikely from evenly matched teams &mdash; the range
is usually between 20 and 45 in our simulations &mdash; so we can conclude
that some teams really are better than others. (More detail about testing for evenly matched teams is <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('inference2')">given later</a>.)
</p>

<p>The diagram also shows the distribution of the standard deviation of points 
  earned by the teams in the simulation. In the real 1999/2000 season, the standard 
  deviation of the points earned by the 20 teams was 16.1. From the simulation, 
  we again conclude that such a high standard deviation would be unlikely if all 
  teams were evenly matched, so skill does seem to play a part in the results.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>Simetimes we only need a single categorical summary from each 
	  run of a simulation to answer the question of interest. On the previous 
	  page, we were only interested in whether Team A was top of the league at 
	  the end of the season.</p>
<p>More often, one or more numerical summaries must be recorded and analysed 
	  from each run.</p></div>
