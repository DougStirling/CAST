<p>We noted earlier that the winning time in each year corresponds to the minimum
of the rectangularly distributed pseudo-random numbers for the 'pool' of
<em>n</em>
elligible competitors. The cumulative distribution function that we use to model
the winning times translates this minimum rectangularly value into an actual winning time.</p>

</p>

<p>As a result, if the winning time in a year is better than in any previous year,
its underlying rectangular pseudo-random value must have also been lower than those that
were used to generate the winning times in previous years.</p>

<p>The number of 'records' in a simulation can therefore be determined from the
rectangular pseudo-random values that were used to generate the winning times. Since
the number of 'records' therefore does not depend on the distribution that is used to
generate the actual winning times from the rectangular values, our conclusions do not
depend on the shape of the population distribution that we assume for running times</p>

<p>Our assumption of normality does not therefore affect our conclusion that changes in
population size alone cannot explain the number of records that occurred.</p>
