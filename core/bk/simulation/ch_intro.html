<p class="heading">Models for Performance in Sport </p>
<p>Examples relating to sport are used as illustrations in this e-book. Most of these
	examples are based on simulations that were developed by Larry Weldon from Simon Fraser University
	in Vancouver, Canada in order to show students
	that even simply-stated probability models can give valuable (and sometimes surprising)
	insight into sporting performance. </p>
<p>When individuals or teams compete in sporting events, we usually concentrate
	on the skill levels of the competitors. However there is also a considerable random
	component in sport results &mdash; when matches are replayed, the results are often
	markedly different. So how much do the reported results reflect skill levels and how
	much are they simply random artifacts? </p>
<p>We will use simulations to investigate this question in a few sporting contexts. </p>
<p class="heading">Tennis </p>
<p>In the first section, simulation methods are introduced with a simple model for a tennis match.</p>
