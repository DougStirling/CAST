<h1>Chapter 8 &nbsp; Non-Normal Data</h1>
<h2>8.1 &nbsp; Distribution of sample mean</h2>
<h3>8.1.1 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters, µ and σ, can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</p>
<h3>8.1.2 &nbsp; Means from normal populations ((page also in Chapter/Topic 3))</h3>
<p>Sample means from normal populations also have normal distributions.</p>
<h3>8.1.3 &nbsp; Large-sample normality of means ((page also in Chapter/Topic 3))</h3>
<p>The shape of the sample mean's distribution is usually close to normal, even if the population distribution is skew or multimodal. The bigger the sample size, the closer the distribution to normal.</p>
<h3>8.1.4 &nbsp; Distribution of mean from a sample</h3>
<p>It is possible to estimate the distribution of a sample mean from a single sample.</p>
<h3>8.1.5 &nbsp; Requirement of independence</h3>
<p>If the sample values are positively correlated, the standard deviation of the mean will be underestimated.</p>
<h3>8.1.6 &nbsp; Normal probability plots</h3>
<p>A normal probability plot is an informal graphical method to help assess whether a data set comes from a normal distribution. Curvature in the probability plot suggests that the data may not be normal.</p>
<h2>8.2 &nbsp; Distribution of sample proportion</h2>
<h3>8.2.1 &nbsp; Estimating means and proportions ((page also in Chapter/Topic 3))</h3>
<p>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</p>
<h3>8.2.2 &nbsp; Proportion and probability</h3>
<p>The population proportion in a category is called its probability. Proportions and probabilities can be obtained from categorical and numerical variables.</p>
<h3>8.2.3 &nbsp; Properties of counts and proportions</h3>
<p>The sample proportion is a statistic that varies from sample to sample. The sample count in a category is also random with a discrete distribution.</p>
<h3>8.2.4 &nbsp; Binomial distribution</h3>
<p>The sample count in a category has a standard distribution called a binomial distribution with parameters n and π.</p>
<h3>8.2.5 &nbsp; Binomial probability examples</h3>
<p>The binomial distribution can be used to find probabilities relating to sample counts.</p>
<h3>8.2.6 &nbsp; Normal approximation to binomial</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, the distribution of the sample count in a category becomes close to a normal distribution.</p>
<h3>8.2.7 &nbsp; Normal approximation examples</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find binomial probabilities.</p>
<h2>8.3 &nbsp; Estimating proportions</h2>
<h3>8.3.1 &nbsp; General framework for estimation</h3>
<p>The methodology for describing the accuracy of a sample mean using standard errors and confidence intervals can also be used for other parameter estimates.</p>
<h3>8.3.2 &nbsp; Estimating a proportion</h3>
<p>A sample proportion estimates the corresponding population proportion, π. There is likely to be an error in this estimate and these errors have a distribution.</p>
<h3>8.3.3 &nbsp; Error distribution</h3>
<p>The estimation errors have a type of binomial distribution that is scaled to have mean zero. Its standard deviation is the standard error of the proportion.</p>
<h3>8.3.4 &nbsp; Normal approximation to error distribution</h3>
<p>If the sample size is high enough, the error distribution is approximately normal. This page gives a few examples for which the error distribution is found.</p>
<h3>8.3.5 &nbsp; Confidence interval for proportion</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence interval for a population proportion is the sample proportion ± twice its standard deviation. Its confidence level is only approximately 95% and guidelines are given for the minimum sample size.</p>
<h3>8.3.6 &nbsp; Properties of 95% CI for proportion</h3>
<p>If samples are repeatedly taken, about 95% of them result in 95% confidence intervals that include the population proportion. Guidelines are given for the minimum sample size to make the confidence level close to 95%.</p>
<h3>8.3.7 &nbsp; Confidence interval examples</h3>
<p>95% confidence intervals for proportions are found and interpreted for several data sets.</p>
<h2>8.4 &nbsp; Sample size (Optional)</h2>
<h3>8.4.1 &nbsp; Sample size for estimating mean</h3>
<p>Given a target width for a 95% confidence interval, it is possible to determine the necessary sample size to achieve this accuracy.</p>
<h3>8.4.2 &nbsp; Sample size for estimating proportion</h3>
<p>In a similar way, given a target width for a 95% confidence interval for a proportion, it is possible to determine the necessary sample size.</p>
<h2>8.5 &nbsp; Simulation &amp; bootstrap (Optional)</h2>
<h3>8.5.1 &nbsp; Need for simulation</h3>
<p>Formulae exist for the standard errors of many common estimators. If such a formula is not available, a different approach is needed.</p>
<h3>8.5.2 &nbsp; Error distribution by simulation</h3>
<p>If a formula for the standard error cannot be found, a simulation can often be used to find the error distribution.</p>
<h3>8.5.3 &nbsp; Simulations with normal distns</h3>
<p>An example is shown where a simulation provides the error distribution and standard error for an upper quartile.</p>
<h3>8.5.4 &nbsp; Bootstrap error distribution</h3>
<p>If the population distribution does not seem to be normal, simulations can be based on samples with replacement from the actual data.</p>
<h2>8.6 &nbsp; Exercises</h2>
<h3>8.6.1 &nbsp; Guessing normal probabilities</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb gives the approximate probability of a value within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. This exercise uses this rule of thumb to find some normal probabilities without formal calculations.</p>
<h3>8.6.2 &nbsp; Spread of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise shows the distribution of the mean or sum of values from samples of different sizes from a normal population. You must match the distributions with their sample sizes.</p>
<h3>8.6.3 &nbsp; Shape of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise examines understanding of the limiting normal distribution of the sample mean and sum as sample size increases, whatever the shape of the population distribution.</p>
<h3>8.6.4 &nbsp; Distribution of mean and sum (cont)</h3>
<p>In this exercise, pop-up menus are used to specify the centre, spread and skewness of the distribution of a sample mean, sample sum or a single value, given the population distribution.</p>
<h3>8.6.5 &nbsp; Standard error of proportion</h3>
<p>A template is provided in this exercise to help evaluate the standard error of a sample proportion.</p>
<h3>8.6.6 &nbsp; 95% confidence interval for probability</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice at evaluating an approximate 95% confidence interval for a probability.</p>
<h3>8.6.7 &nbsp; Other confidence levels</h3>
<p>This exercise requests a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence intervals for a probability. A normal density can be used to find the relevant z-score and a template helps evaluate the 'plus-minus' value.</p>
<h3>8.6.8 &nbsp; Factors affecting width of confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, confidence level and population probability affect the width of a CI for the probability.</p>
<h3>8.6.9 &nbsp; Interpreting a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise presents 3 different statements about a 95% confidence interval and asks which is correct.</p>
