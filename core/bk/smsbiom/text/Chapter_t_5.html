<h1>Chapter 5 &nbsp; Statistical Models</h1>
<h2>5.1 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2>
<h3>5.1.1 &nbsp; Bivariate data sets</h3>
<p>Many data sets contain two or more measurements from each individual. Even when the main interest is in one variable, the others can help to understand its distribution.</p>
<h3>5.1.2 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h3>
<p>Univariate displays don't show relationships between variables.</p>
<h3>5.1.3 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>A scatterplot of two variables can be enhanced with box plots or histograms on the margins of a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>5.1.4 &nbsp; Time series</h3>
<p>When a single measurement is made at regular intervals, the data are called a time series. Time series data can be treated as bivariate, with time being the second variable.</p>
<h2>5.2 &nbsp; Understanding relationships</h2>
<h3>5.2.1 &nbsp; Strength of a relationship</h3>
<p>The main feature of interest in a scatterplot is the strength of the relationship between the two variables.</p>
<h3>5.2.2 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>An extreme value of one or both of the variables is an outlier. An unusual combination of values is also called an outlier.</p>
<h3>5.2.3 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>If the crosses on a scatterplot separate into clusters, different groups of individuals are suggested.</p>
<h3>5.2.4 &nbsp; Explanatory and response variables</h3>
<p>One variable can often be classified as an explanatory variable that either causally affects the reponse variable, or is useful for predicting its value.</p>
<h2>5.3 &nbsp; Least squares</h2>
<h3>5.3.1 &nbsp; Linear models</h3>
<p>A straight line can often be used to predict one variable from another.</p>
<h3>5.3.2 &nbsp; Fitted values and residuals</h3>
<p>The difference between the actual value of Y and the value predicted by a line is called a residual. Small residuals are clearly desirable.</p>
<h3>5.3.3 &nbsp; Least squares</h3>
<p>The sum of squared residuals describes the accuracy of predictions from a line. The method of least squares positions the line to minimise the sum of squared residuals.</p>
<h3>5.3.4 &nbsp; Quadratic models</h3>
<p>An alternative solution to nonlinearity is to fit a quadratic curve the data, again using the principle of least squares.</p>
<h2>5.4 &nbsp; Linear regression models</h2>
<h3>5.4.1 &nbsp; Interest in generalising from data</h3>
<p>Some bivariate data sets describe complete populations. Others are 'representative' of an underlying population or process.</p>
<h3>5.4.2 &nbsp; Normal linear model</h3>
<p>The response is often modelled with a normal distribution whose mean is a linear function of X and whose standard deviation is constant.</p>
<h3>5.4.3 &nbsp; Model parameters</h3>
<p>The normal linear model has 3 unknown parameters. For many data sets, these parameters have meaningful interpretations.</p>
<h2>5.5 &nbsp; Estimating parameters</h2>
<h3>5.5.1 &nbsp; Estimating the slope and intercept</h3>
<p>A least squares line provides estimates of the linear model's slope and intercept. These estimates are random values â€” they vary from sample to sample.</p>
<h3>5.5.2 &nbsp; Distn of least squares estimates</h3>
<p>The least squares estimate of the model's slope has a normal distribution that is centred on the true value.</p>
<h3>5.5.3 &nbsp; Standard error of least squares slope</h3>
<p>The distribution of the least squares slope may be estimated from a single data set.</p>
<h3>5.5.4 &nbsp; 95% confidence interval for slope</h3>
<p>A confidence interval for the model's slope can be obtained from its least squares estimate and its standard error.</p>
<h3>5.5.5 &nbsp; Properties of confidence interval</h3>
<p>Confidence intervals for the model's slope have the same properties as confidence intervals for population means or proportions.</p>
<h2>5.6 &nbsp; Testing regression parameters</h2>
<h3>5.6.1 &nbsp; Importance of zero slope</h3>
<p>If the model's slope is zero, the response distribution does not depend on the explanatory variable. This special case is particularly meaningful in many studies.</p>
<h3>5.6.2 &nbsp; Testing whether slope is zero</h3>
<p>The p-value for testing whether a linear model's slope is zero is the probability that its least squares estimate is as far from zero as the recorded value.</p>
<h2>5.7 &nbsp; Exercises</h2>
<h3>5.7.1 &nbsp; Drawing a straight line</h3>
<p>This exercise shows the equation of a straight line and asks you to sketch it.</p>
<h3>5.7.2 &nbsp; Slope and intercept</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page do the inverse of the previous exercise -- you are shown a straight line and asked to find its equation.</p>
<h3>5.7.3 &nbsp; Interpreting the slope and intercept</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you are asked to select one of four statements that correctly describes the slope or intercept of a least squares line in the context of the data.</p>
<h3>5.7.4 &nbsp; Standard error of slope</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice in evaluating a 95% confidence interval for a regression model's slope, based on its least squares estimate and standard error.</p>
<h3>5.7.5 &nbsp; Test for zero slope</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice with the calculations to evaluate the p-value for testing whether a linear model's slope is zero and interpreting the results.</p>
<h3>5.7.6 &nbsp; Regression problems</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to identify the difficulties with using the least squares line to predict Y at a given X from the data in a displayed scatterplot (an outlier, curvature, a high-leverage point or extrapolation).</p>
