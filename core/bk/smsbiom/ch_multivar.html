  <p>Earlier chapters examined the distribution of values in single variables 
    and the relationship between pairs of variables. However many data sets contain 
    three or more measurements from each individual.</p>
  <p>Furthermore these measurements may be numerical or categorical.  We introduce the ideas of modelling
  these more realistic, though also more complex situations. </p> 
  <p> We also introduce the logistic model where the variable of interest is binomial and we wish to model
  its variability in terms of other measurements, just as we have done earlier for normally distributed data.
