<p>In this Chapter, like Topic 8 in e-sms, we first review why the normal distribution is so important in statistics.
Then we look particularly at data that come from asking yes/no or true/false questions.  These are often called binomial data.
They are a special case of categorical data, e.g. data on a five-point scale (very bad, to very good), where there are just 2 categories.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 6 in this CAST book has shown how categorical data can be summarised and we we move here to statistical inference where, as in 
Topic/Chapters 3 and 4,
we assume the data are a sample from some population of interest. 
</p>


<p>Modelling in this way allows us
to better assess features in the data. In particular, we can 
assess the precision of summary statistics, such as a sample 
proportion.
