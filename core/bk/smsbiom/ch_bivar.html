  <p>When only a single measurement is made from each individual (or unit) in a 
    group, we cannot associate variation in that measurement with other characteristics 
    of the individuals &mdash; all variation is <strong>unexplained</strong>. </p>

  <p>When two or more measurements are made from each individual, we may be be able 
    to associate variation in one measurement with changes in the other measurements; 
    this can <strong>explain</strong> some of the variation.  
    Examples are ... </p>

<ul>
    <li>Annual salary and years of experience of accountants in a large accounting 
			company </li>
  <li>Floor area and sale price of houses in a town</li>
    <li>Sales of cameras and advertising expenditure by a chain of photographic 
			shops in each of 20 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>Our aim with such data is to find information about the <strong>relationship</strong>
between the variables. We use this example of a simple (regression) model also to show how
the modelling process makes use of the ideas of <strong>estimation</strong> and <strong>testing</strong> that were discussed in the two previous Chapters/Topics.
