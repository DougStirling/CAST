An approximate 95% confidence interval for the parameter is therefore the estimate Â± 2SE.</page>


<page dir="en/ciMean" filePrefix="ciMean4" nameOverride="Confidence level" summaryDir="en/ciMean" summaryFilePrefix="s_ciMean4" videoDir="en/ciMean" videoFilePrefix="v_ciMean4">In practice, the population standard deviation is usually unknown. If the population SD is simply replaced by its sample equivalent, the interval estimate has a lower confidence level than 95%.</page>

<page dir="en/ciMean" filePrefix="ciMean6" summaryDir="en/ciMean" summaryFilePrefix="s_ciMean6" videoDir="en/ciMean" videoFilePrefix="v_ciMean6">A simulation demonstrates that the resulting 95% confidence intervals have probability 0.95 of including the population mean.</page>
