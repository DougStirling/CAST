<page dir="en/leastSqrs" filePrefix="e_leastSqrs4">In this exercise, you are asked to select one of four statements that correctly describes the slope or intercept of a least squares line in the context of the data.</page>




<page dir="en/regnEst" filePrefix="e_regnEst1">This exercise gives practice in evaluating a 95% confidence interval for a regression model's slope, based on its least squares estimate and standard error.</page>
<page dir="en/curvature" filePrefix="e_curvature1">This exercise asks you to identify the difficulties with using the least squares line to predict Y at a given X from the data in a displayed scatterplot (an outlier, curvature, a high-leverage point or extrapolation).</page>
<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread6">The two exercises on this page ask the effect of combining different groups of values or adding an outlier on the mean and standard deviation.</page>
<page dir="en/randomMean" filePrefix="e_randomMean2">This exercise examines understanding of the limiting normal distribution of the sample mean and sum as sample size increases, whatever the shape of the population distribution.</page>
<page dir="en/randomMean" filePrefix="e_randomMean3">In this exercise, pop-up menus are used to specify the centre, spread and skewness of the distribution of a sample mean, sample sum or a single value, given the population distribution.</page>
<page dir="en/estPropn" filePrefix="e_estPropn4">This exercise asks how the sample size, confidence level and population probability affect the width of a CI for the probability.</page>
