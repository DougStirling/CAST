<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp2" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp2" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp2">A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</page>
<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp_b3" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp3" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp_b3">When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</page>


<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp6" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp6" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp6">Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</page>
