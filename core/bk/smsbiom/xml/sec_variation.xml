<page dir="en/variation" filePrefix="variation2" summaryDir="en/variation" summaryFilePrefix="s_variation2" videoDir="en/variation" videoFilePrefix="v_variation2">When data are collected from 'individuals', they often vary considerably.</page>
<page dir="en/variation" filePrefix="variation3" summaryDir="en/variation" summaryFilePrefix="s_variation3" videoDir="en/variation" videoFilePrefix="v_variation3">Intentional differences to experimental conditions may also cause systematic differences in variables. Natural variability makes it harder to interpret experimental results.</page>
<page dir="en/variation" filePrefix="variation4" summaryDir="en/variation" summaryFilePrefix="s_variation4" videoDir="en/variation" videoFilePrefix="v_variation4">The natural variability of individuals also makes it harder to interpret information from surveys.</page>
<page dir="en/variation" filePrefix="variation5" summaryDir="en/variation" summaryFilePrefix="s_variation5" videoDir="en/variation" videoFilePrefix="v_variation5">Some variation in a variable can be explained in terms of other recorded variables. Other variation is a result of natural variability in the individuals.</page>
