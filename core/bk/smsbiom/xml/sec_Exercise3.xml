<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="e_normalDistn1">One exercise asks you to guess the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Another requests a sketch of a normal distribution given its mean and standard deviation.</page>





<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="e_normalDistn7">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb gives the approximate probability of a value within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. Te exercise uses this rule of thumb to find some normal probabilities without formal calculations.</page>

<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="e_popSamp1">The exercise on this page asks whether three statements describe populations or samples.</page>
<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="e_popSamp2">This exercise asks whether three statements describe parameters or estimates.</page>
<page dir="en/seMean" filePrefix="e_seMean1">The exercise on this page shows a data set with the sample mean and st devn. The standard error of the mean must be calculated.</page>
<page dir="en/seMean" filePrefix="e_seMean2">This exercise states the value of either the standard deviation or the standard error or the mean. The question asks for an interval containing about 95% of the values or an interval with 95% confidence of including the popn mean.</page>
<page dir="en/seMean" filePrefix="e_seMean3">This exercise asks 3 questions about the effect of sample size and spread of sample values on the sd and se, and about the interpretation of the se and sd.</page>
<page dir="en/ciMean" filePrefix="e_ciMean3">This exercise is similar to the previous one but requires use of a t distribution since the population standard deviation is unknown.</page>
<page dir="en/ciMean" filePrefix="e_ciMean6">This exercise asks how the sample size, sample standard deviation and confidence level affect the width of a CI for the mean.</page>
<page dir="en/ciMean" filePrefix="e_ciMean7">In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</page>
