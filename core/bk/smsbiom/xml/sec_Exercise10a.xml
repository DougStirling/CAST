<page dir="en/boxPlot" filePrefix="e_boxPlot2">The exercises on this page involve matching the shape of box plots to the corresponding dot plots.</page>

<page dir="en/displayInterp" filePrefix="e_displayInterp1">In this exercise, you will interpret what distributions with symmetry, skewness, clusters or outliers tell you about the data.</page>

<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread1">In this exercise, you should summarise the difference between two distributions in terms of their different centres and spreads.</page>
<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread3">The first exercise asks for a rough 'guess' at the standard deviation of data sets from a stacked dot plot. The second exercise is similar but displays the data as a histogram or box plot.</page>
<page dir="en/seMean" filePrefix="e_seMean3">This exercise asks 3 questions about the effect of sample size and spread of sample values on the sd and se, and about the interpretation of the se and sd.</page>
<page dir="en/ciMean" filePrefix="e_ciMean7">In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</page>
<page dir="en/testPValue" filePrefix="e_testPValue3">This exercise is similar to the previous one but the wordings of the conclusions are harder.</page>
