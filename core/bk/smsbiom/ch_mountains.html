<p>Computers have totally changed statistics and hence the way it can be taught.  Before computers we were
at the "top of the mountain".  There were different calculations for each analysis (like little streams at the top of the mountain!) and the formulae had to be understood
or at least followed for each of them.</p>
<p>  
It is very different now in two ways. The statistical methods have been unified for many problems - we have come down the mountain!  And we don't
need to do the calculations anyway, because that is what the computer does for us.  So statistics courses can change.  They no longer need to introduce topics in their 
order of complexity of calculation.  And we should emphasise concepts rather than formulae.  That's what we hope we have done in this course.
</p>
<p>One reason for this course is that too many statistics teachers are still at the top of the mountain.  So courses still often enphasise theory and formulae, rather than concepts.
And this puts many people off.  We hope the way we have taught SMS has given you some confidence in statistics as well as some understanding of key ideas.</p>
<p>
CAST is an example that shows how statistics books can change too, now that we have access to computers.  And within CAST we have found that the exercises
epimomise ways in which an interactive book can add fun to the learning.
</p>
<p>
So, in this last Topic, there is no new work, but we have collected a few of the exercises that you can use to check your current knowledge.
