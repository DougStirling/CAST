  <p>This book is a companion to the "Statistics made Simple" (e-sms) course. It has 10 chapters
with each chapter corresponding to a Topic in e-sms.  The e-sms course is designed to cover the important concepts that 
you would be comfortable with, had you received the right training when you were an undergraduate. </p> <p>This CAST book is based largely on the Introductory biostatistics book</p>
<p>
So, the e-sms is intended for graduates and 
proceeds at what might be called "graduate pace".  In contrast, CAST is an undergraduate-level book.  So, it goes more slowly.
    How long you spend on CAST each week will depend on how much time you have and how you most enjoy learning the topics that are covered.</p>
	
  <p>How you use CAST is also up to you.  For most pages you may choose between listening to <strong>short videos</strong>, or practicing with the <strong>interactive elements</strong>. 
  The last section in each chapter gives the <strong>CAST exercises</strong> that relate to that Topic/Chapter.  If you think you are OK with the materials in a particular topics
  then you could go straight to the exercises.  </p>
  <p>We are very enthusiastic about the exercises in CAST.
  If you are ever unsure what to do, then there is always a <strong>"Tell me"</strong> button, and CAST will then do the exercise for you. 
Each exercise can be tried as many times as you like - and each try is always slightly different.  That's so you really understand the concept.  
And whether the answer is right, or wrong, there is always some help to guide you further.  </p>
