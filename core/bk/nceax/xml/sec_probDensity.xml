<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity5'>A simulation shows how a histogram becomes more stable and smoother when the sample size increases and classes are made narrower. The limiting histogram is called a probability density function.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity6'>This diagram show a normal pdf with sliders to adjust the mean and sd. (The area remains constant.)</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity8'>This diagram allows you to drag over the classes in a histogram or the possible values in a pdf. It illustrates that area equals probability.</page>
