<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity1'>This diagram shows a bar chart of a finite categorical population. Clicking any bar labels it with the probability that a single sampled value is that category -- i.e. the bar height.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity2'>This diagram illustrates that the population proportion of values in a range equals the probability for a single value. A range of values on the population dot plot can be highlighted and is labeled both as a proportion and probability.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity3'>In this diagram, the sample size can be increased, showing that a sample proportion tends to a limit (the probability) as the sample size increases.</page>
<page dir='en/probDensity' filePrefix='l_probDensity4'>This simulation shows how a bar chart becomes more stable when the sample size increases. The limiting bar chart gives the population probabilities.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density5'>Diagram showing that area = relative frequency.</page>
