<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot4'>One diagram shows that a basic box plot cannot distinguish between a skew distribution and a symmetric distribution with an outlier. A second diagram explains which values in an improved box plot are separately displayed as crosses; in it, values can be dragged to become outliers.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot5'>One diagram transforms a regular distribution into one with clusters and shows that box plots cannot display clusters. A real example with clusters is also displayed.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot6'>A real example shows how box plots effectively summarise the differences between 12 groups.</page>
