<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='l_centerSpread5'>Diagram showing how the standard deviation reflects the spread of values in a data set. (The spread can be changed with a slider.)</page>
<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='l_centerSpread6'>Examples illustrating the 70-95-100 rule of thumb for four data sets that are reasonably symmetric and also for another skew data set.</page>
<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='l_centerSpread7'>A published table of means and sds for several variables in two groups is displayed. A diagram shows how sketched histograms can be drawn from the means and sds, showing the degree of overlap between the distributions in the two groups.</page>
<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='l_centerSpread8'>Diagram showing four data sets with the same mean and sd but differently shaped distributions (symmetric, a single outlier, two clusters, and skew). It shows that you must examine a graphical display, not just the mean and sd.</page>
