<page dir='bk/nceax' filePrefix='l_rSquared1'>The residual, total and explained sums of squares describe unexplained, overall and explained variation in the response. They can all be described as sum of squared vertical distances on a scatterplot. This page shows these vertical distances on a scatterplot.</page>
<page dir='bk/nceax' filePrefix='l_rSquared2'>The relative sizes of the explained and residual sums of squares holds information about the strength of the relationship. The coefficient of determination describes the proportion of total variation that is explained.</page>
<page dir='bk/nceax' filePrefix='l_rSquared3'>A few data sets are shown and the coefficient of determination is evaluated and interpreted.</page>
