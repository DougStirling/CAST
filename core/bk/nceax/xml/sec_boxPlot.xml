<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot1'>An example allows you to switch between various displays to compare five groups. Dot plots contain distracting detail; histograms are better; but box plots highlight the important differences between the groups.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot2'>A diagram shows how a box plot splits the data into quarters. You can drag the quartiles to show how the box plot shape relates to the distribution of values in a dot plot. It can also show how the median and quartiles split a histogram area into quarters (approximately).</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='l_boxPlot3'>Sliders can change the centre, spread, skewness and tails of a data set, showing how these affect the shape of the box plot.</page>
