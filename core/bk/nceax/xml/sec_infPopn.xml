<page dir='en/infPopn' filePrefix='l_infPopn1'>Several data sets are shown where we are not interested in the specific 'individuals' but want to generalise to something wider.</page>
<page dir='en/infPopn' filePrefix='l_infPopn2'>This diagram takes samples of different sizes to illustrate the randomness of most data sets. It can be used to explain that we are not interested in the details of a particular data set but are trying to understand something more general about what underlies the data.</page>
<page dir='en/infPopn' filePrefix='l_infPopn4'>A static example shows a sample bar chart. It provides an estimate of an underlying population proportion that is of more interest.</page>
