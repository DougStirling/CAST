<page dir='en/groupedCat' filePrefix='l_groupedCat1'>This diagram shows how contingency tables are formed from raw data -- either from lists of categories in several groups or two categorical variables in a data matrix.</page>
<page dir='en/groupedCat' filePrefix='l_groupedCat2'>Examples show contingency tables from experiments and surveys.</page>
<page dir='en/groupedCat' filePrefix='l_groupedCat3'>This diagram shows an example in which the groups have different sizes. It shows that changing the counts into proportions (or percentages) makes it easier to compare groups.</page>
<page dir='en/structures' filePrefix='l_structures4'>Diagrams showing how groups can be represented by a categorical variable and a categorical variable can split data into groups.</page>
<page dir='en/bivarCat' filePrefix='l_bivarCat4'>This diagram uses dynamic stacking of the bars in clustered bar charts to show the marginal proportions for X and Y.</page>
<page dir='en/bivarCat' filePrefix='l_bivarCat5'>This diagram shows a table of joint frequencies that can be changed into a table of conditional proportions. Clicking rows or columns shows the calculations underlying these conditional proportions.</page>
<page dir='en/bivarCat' filePrefix='l_bivarCat7'>This is a kind of Venn diagram in which the areas equal the joint proportions. The rectangles can be changed in shape to show (the marginal propns for X and conditional propns for Y) or (the marginal propns for Y and conditional propns for X).</page>
