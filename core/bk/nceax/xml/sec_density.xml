<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density1'>Diagram showing stacked dot plot changing into histogram. A smooth 'density' curve can be superimposed.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density2'>Diagram showing how rectangle height equals class frequency.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density3'>Diagram showing how choice of classes affects histogram shape. It shows jagged shape when classes are too narrow and blocky shape when they are too wide.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density4'>Diagram showing that histogram shape can depend greatly on choice of classes for small data sets. Be careful not to over-interpret shape.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density5'>Diagram showing that histograms of two groups of different sizes can be better compared if relative frequency is used instead of frequency.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density6'>Diagrams showing how frequency polygons are related to histograms and demonstrating that they are better for comparing groups.	</page>
