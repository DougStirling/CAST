<p>Welcome to  <em>CAST for NCEA.</em> This  'e-book' contains a set of resources  for teachers of  the New Zealand <em>National Certificate of Educational Achievement</em> (NCEA).</p>
<p>Each page contains a dynamic diagram that can be used to help explain some concept in the curriculum. The diagrams should also make lessons more interesting. They are formatted for use with a data projector and are therefore fairly large with little supporting text visible. However there are buttons that expand to give advice on the most effective way to use the diagrams.</p>
<p class="heading">Coverage of the curriculum</p>
<p>This e-book does not cover everything in the curriculum or that must be learned for the NCEA assessments. It  provides coverage of <strong>many</strong> of the methods and concepts in the curriculum but you should be aware that it is incomplete.</p>
<p class="heading">Teaching approach</p>
<p>The approach taken in this e-book is method-based and deals with the statistical concepts and techniques required at each level of the curriculum in a logical order. This approach is good for revision and reference but <strong>we do not recommend it for primary classroom teaching</strong>. In the classroom, a data-motivated approach is better.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>Statistics is only important because it can answer important questions about real-life data and problems.</p>
</div>
<p> We therefore recommend that teachers introduce each topic with data sets and problems. Statistical methods should be introduced as required to deal with the data. The material in this e-book can then provide detailed information about these methods.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>Most of the diagrams are also present in the companion <a href="javascript:openEbook('ncea')"><strong>e-book for NCEA students</strong></a> but that e-book is designed for self-study and contains much more descriptive text and exercises.</p>
