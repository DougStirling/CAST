<p>This chapter describes simple methods to summarise categorical data with frequency tables, pie charts and bar charts.</p>
<p>This material is mostly  taught <strong>before</strong> Year 11 in New Zealand high schools so teachers may find it helpful when teaching statistics in Years 9 and 10 (or even earlier). In Year 11, it should be <strong>mainly revision</strong> of material that has already been taught but some pages are likely to provide <strong>extra information</strong> about specific methods. (There is some variability in the coverage of topics in Years 9 and 10 between schools.)</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>The material in this chapter can be used to support the teaching of statistical methods up to Year 10.</p>
	<p>It can also be used for revision within NCEA Level 1.</p>
</div>
<p>The chapter contains interactive diagrams for teachers to use on data projectors.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>The material <strong>does not cover the complete curriculum</strong>. It has been provided as support material for <strong>parts</strong> of the curriculum.</p>
