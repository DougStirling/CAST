<p>This chapter explains some statistical concepts related to the NCEA level 3 standard <em><strong>&quot;3.10: Use statistical methods to make a formal inference&quot;</strong></em>. It is usually taught at Year 13 in New Zealand high schools and is assessed at NCEA Level 3.</p>
<p>The most commonly used type of inference involves estimation of a population mean from the corresponding mean of a random sample. This chapter explains how confidence intervals are used to express the uncertainty in such an estimate. Similar methods are used for estimating a population proportion or the difference between the means in two different populations.</p>

<p>Estimation of population means is based on normal distributions, so it is important that you understand normal distributions and can do calculations based on them. Normal distributions can be revised from the following section:</p>
