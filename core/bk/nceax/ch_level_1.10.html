<p>This chapter explains some statistical concepts related to the NCEA level 1 standard <em><strong>&quot;1.10: Investigate a given multivariate data set using the statistical enquiry cycle&quot;</strong></em>, extending the material in the pre-NCEA chapter <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('ch_numbers')">Looking at Numbers</a>. It describes more advanced  histograms and box plots and explains the types of information that you can get from them. This material is usually taught in Year 11 in New Zealand high schools and is assessed at NCEA Level 1.</p>

<p class="heading">Assumed background</p>
<p>Many statistical methods for summarising data in graphs  are taught before Year 11. The pre-NCEA chapter <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('ch_numbers')">Looking at Numbers</a> of this e-book covers many of these methods and can be used for revision. It is therefore definitely worth working through this 'revision' material.</p>
<p>Make sure that your students fully understand the initial chapters before starting work on the new material here.</p>
