<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density1'>Diagram showing stacked dot plot changing into histogram. A smooth 'density' curve can be superimposed.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density2'>Diagram showing how rectangle height equals class frequency.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density3'>Diagram showing how choice of classes affects histogram shape. It shows jagged shape when classes are too narrow and blocky shape when they are too wide.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density_b4'>Diagram showing that histogram shape can depend greatly on choice of classes for small data sets. Be careful not to over-interpret shape.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density5'>Diagram showing that area = relative frequency.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density_b6'>Diagram showing that histograms of two groups of different sizes can be better compared if relative frequency is used instead of frequency.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density_b7'>Diagrams showing that the area for each value and the total area should stay the same when classes are combined.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density8'>Diagram showing when mixed class widths might be desirable. It also shows that the proportion of the histogram area above any classes equals the proportion of values, even when there are varying classed widths.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density9'>Diagrams showing how frequency polygons are related to histograms and demonstrating that they are better for comparing groups.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='l_density10'>Diagram explaining and using kernel density estimates.</page>
