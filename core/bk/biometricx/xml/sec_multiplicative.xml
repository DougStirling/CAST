<page dir='en/multiplicative' filePrefix='l_multiplicative1'>Three examples are shown on this page. In each, a slider applies a log transformation to linearise, give constant amplitude to seasonal variation or make residual variation more constant.</page>
<page dir='en/multiplicative' filePrefix='l_multiplicative2'>This diagram gives an example of quarterly data where an additive model does underestimates the amplitude of variation at the end of the series. When the model is applied to the log data, it fits better. This multiplicative model can also be displayed on the original axes.</page>
<page dir='en/multiplicative' filePrefix='l_multiplicative3'>This diagram shows how a multiplicative model can provide forecasts. It shows forecasts of the linear, seasonal and cyclical components on a log scale. A slider can transform these back to the original units.</page>
