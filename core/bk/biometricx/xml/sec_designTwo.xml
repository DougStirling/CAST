<page dir='en/designTwo' filePrefix='l_designTwo1'>A simulation shows that it is possible to vary a second factor in an experiment with a single factor without affecting the accuracy of the estimated effects.</page>
<page dir='en/designTwo' filePrefix='l_designTwo2'>This is a 3-dimensional graphical display of the 2-factor model with no interaction. Rotating it helps to explain the additivity of the factor effects.</page>
<page dir='en/designTwo' filePrefix='l_designTwo3'>This diagram illustrates interaction for a 2x2 experiment and shows that a factorial design is needed to detect interaction.</page>
<page dir='en/designTwo' filePrefix='l_designTwo4'>Example of factorial data with two factors and a 3-dimensional display with checkboxes to allow main effects and interaction to be added to the model. It helps to reinforce the idea of interaction.</page>
<page dir='en/designTwo' filePrefix='l_designTwo_b5'>A 3-dimensional diagram shows a data set with three factors; checkboxes allow the three main effects to be added to the model and it is displayed graphically in the diagram.</page>
<page dir='en/designTwo' filePrefix='l_designTwo6'>This diagram presents an example in which there is interaction between two of the three factors.</page>
