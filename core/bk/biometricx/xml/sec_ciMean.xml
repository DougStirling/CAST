<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='l_ciMean_b1'>Example where the value of the population standard deviation is a know value and diagram showing how a 95% confidence interval is calculated.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='l_ciMean2'>A simulation demonstrates the 95% confidence level for this type of interval estimate.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='l_ciMean3'>A simulation shows that simply replacing the population SD by the sample SD results in a CI whose confidence level is less than 95%.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='l_ciMean4'>This diagram shows how the confidence level depends on the value k that replaces 1.96. The necessary t-value is close to 1.96 when the sample size is large, but larger for small samples.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='l_ciMean5'>This diagram shows how the t-value for a 95% CI depends on the degrees of freedom.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='l_ciMean6'>A simulation demonstrates that the 95% confidence intervals have probability 0.95 of including the population mean.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='l_ciMean_b7'>This page gives some examples of 95% confidence intervals and their interpretation.</page>
