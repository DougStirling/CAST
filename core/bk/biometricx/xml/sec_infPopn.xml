<page dir="en/infPopn" filePrefix="l_infPopn_b1">Several data sets are shown where we are not interested in the specific 'individuals' but want to generalise to something wider.</page>
<page dir="en/infPopn" filePrefix="l_infPopn_b2">This diagram takes samples of different sizes to illustrate the randomness of most data sets. It can be used to explain that we are not interested in the details of a particular data set but are trying to understand something more general about what underlies the data.</page>
<page dir="en/infPopn" filePrefix="l_infPopn3">This diagram takes samples of locations (of 6 cows in a field) from a grid of locations (a finite population). The grid can be made finer with the limit being samples from an infinite population of all possible positions in the field.</page>
<page dir="en/infPopn" filePrefix="l_infPopn4">A static example shows a sample bar chart. It provides an estimate of an underlying population proportion that is of more interest.</page>
