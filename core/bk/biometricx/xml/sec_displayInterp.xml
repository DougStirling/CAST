<page dir='en/displayInterp' filePrefix='l_displayInterp1'>Diagram distinguishing between an 'outlier' that is probably an error (or different type of individual) and one that is simply a value in the tail of a skew distribution.</page>
<page dir='en/displayInterp' filePrefix='l_displayInterp2'>This diagram shows two data sets about eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser that have distinct clusters of values and a further two data sets where the clusters are less pronounced.</page>
<page dir='en/displayInterp' filePrefix='l_displayInterp_b3'>This page shows stacked dot plots for two examples. The name of the 'individual' associated with each cross can be displayed by clicking on it and these names help understanding of the distribution.</page>
<page dir='en/displayInterp' filePrefix='l_displayInterp4'>In this diagram, the crosses in a dot plot can be coloured to show their group. The groups can be separated out into different bands above a common axis to better distinguish and compare them.</page>
<page dir='en/displayInterp' filePrefix='l_displayInterp5'>A back-to-back stem and leaf plot is shown for two of the groups in the previous page.</page>
<page dir='en/displayInterp' filePrefix='l_displayInterp6'>This diagram is a simulation showing variability in stem and leaf plot of small data sets. Outliers, clusters or skewness occasionally appear even when there are no such features in the underlying process.</page>
