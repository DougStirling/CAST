<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='l_twoGroupInf1'>A simulation shows that sample-to-sample variation in the difference between two means matches the theoretical distribution.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='l_twoGroupInf_b2'>The calculations for the standard error and approximate error distribution are shown for a few real data sets.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='l_twoGroupInf_b3'>This page shows the calculations to find 95% CIs for several real data sets and interprets the CIs in words.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='l_twoGroupInf4'>This simulation shows that approx 95% of the 95% CIs include the true difference between the popn means.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='l_twoGroupInf_b5'>This page shows the calculations to find the p-values for testing whether two means are equal for a few real data sets. The conclusions from the test are also described.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='l_twoGroupInf6'>This simulation supports the fact that all p-values between 0 and 1 are equally likely if the group means are equal. A second simulation when the group means are different shows that the p-values are more likely to be near zero.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='l_twoGroupInf_b7'>This diagram shows the calculations for applying 1-tailed tests to a few real data sets.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='l_twoGroupInf8'>A simulation shows that all p-values between 0 and 1 are equally likely when both group means are the same.</page>
