<page dir="es/causal" filePrefix="causal_b1" summaryDir="en/causal" summaryFilePrefix="s_causal1">For most data sets, we are interested in understanding the relationships between the variables. However interpreting relationships must be done with care.</page>
<page dir="es/causal" filePrefix="causal2" summaryDir="en/causal" summaryFilePrefix="s_causal2">If the relationship between X and Y is causal, it is possible to predict the effect of changing the value of X.</page>
<page dir="es/causal" filePrefix="causal_b3" summaryDir="en/causal" summaryFilePrefix="s_causal3">Causality can only be deduced from how the data were collected &amp;mdash; the data values themselves do not contain any information about causality.</page>
<page dir="es/causal" filePrefix="causal_b4" summaryDir="en/causal" summaryFilePrefix="s_causal4">In an observational study, values are passively recorded from individuals. Experiments are characterised by the experimenter's control over the values of one or more variables.</page>
