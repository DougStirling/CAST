	<p>Understanding the properties of p-values allows you to interpret the results of a wide range of hypothesis tests, even if you do not know the details of how the p-values were obtained.</p>

<page dir="es/testPValue" filePrefix="testPValue1" summaryDir="en/testPValue" summaryFilePrefix="s_testPValue1">Hypothesis tests ask whether the sample data are consistent with a statement about the parameters called the null hypothesis.</page>
<page dir="es/testPValue" filePrefix="testPValue_b2" summaryDir="en/testPValue" summaryFilePrefix="s_testPValue2">A p-value is a numerical measure of whether the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis.</page>
<page dir="es/testPValue" filePrefix="testPValue3" summaryDir="en/testPValue" summaryFilePrefix="s_testPValue3">When the null hypothesis is true, any p-value between 0 and 1 is equally likely. When the alternative hypothesis is true, p-values near 0 are more likely. A p-value near 0 therefore gives evidence that the alternative hypothesis holds.</page>
<page dir="es/testPValue" filePrefix="testPValue4" summaryDir="en/testPValue" summaryFilePrefix="s_testPValue4">A p-value is the probability of getting such 'extreme' data when the null hypothesis holds.</page>
<page dir="es/testPValue" filePrefix="testPValue_b5" summaryDir="en/testPValue" summaryFilePrefix="s_testPValue5">P-values have the same properties and interpretation for all tests. A test for whether a population has a normal distribution is used as an example.</page>
