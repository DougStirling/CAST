<page dir="es/timePlot" filePrefix="timePlot_b1" summaryDir="en/timePlot" summaryFilePrefix="s_timePlot1">A time series plot is similar to a scatterplot with 'time' as the variable on the horizontal axis. Successive values are usually joined by lines to emphasise systematic movements in the series.</page>
<page dir="es/timePlot" filePrefix="timePlot_b2" summaryDir="en/timePlot" summaryFilePrefix="s_timePlot2">A few examples show time series with trend, seasonal pattern and other oscillations.</page>
<page dir="es/timePlot" filePrefix="timePlot3" summaryDir="en/timePlot" summaryFilePrefix="s_timePlot3">An example shows four different time series on the same graph.</page>
