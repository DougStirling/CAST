<p>Experiments can be complex, but some core concepts and methods can be introduced in the context of extremely simple experiments in which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nothing is known about the characteristics of the experimental units before the experiment is started.
  </li>
  <li>The researcher will only adjust the levels of a single controlled factor.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we describe:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the best design for such an experiment (random allocation of treatments to experimental units)</li>
	<li>a model for the response</li>
	<li>summarising the effect of the factor with parameter estimates</li>
	<li>analysis of variance to test whether the factor does affect the response.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods will be  the basis of design and analysis for more complex experiments in later chapters.</p>
