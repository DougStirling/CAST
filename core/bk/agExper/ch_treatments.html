<p>In most experiments, there is structure to the treatments that are applied. In factorial experiments, this structure  consists of the separate factors and their interactions. However even in experiments with a single factor, the factor levels may  have some structure. If an analysis of variance test concludes that a factor affects the response, it is possible to further investigate its effect, guided by what is known about the structure of the factor levels.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Contrasts can be used to ask specific questions about the treatments.</li>
	<li>If the levels of a controlled factor are numerical values of an explanatory variable, we might model a smooth relationship between the explanatory variable and response.</li>
	<li>If a factor has a significant effect on the response and has several levels, multiple comparisons can be used to suggest which groups of level means may be equal.</li>
	<li>An experiment may be designed with unequal replicates in order to make some comparisons of factor levels more accurate.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The factors in an experiment are variables that are controlled by the researcher. Sometimes additional information is obtained from the experimental units that is uncontrolled but helps to explain differences between them. Such variables are called <strong>covariates</strong> and are the subject of the last section in this chapter.</p>
