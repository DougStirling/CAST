<page dir='en/oneFactorIntro' filePrefix='oneFactorIntro1'>The terminology used for experiments is first reviewed -- experimental units, controlled variables and a response.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactorIntro' filePrefix='oneFactorIntro2'>In practice, experiments can be quite complex. A few examples are described within the framework described in the previous page.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactorIntro' filePrefix='oneFactorIntro_b3'>Extremely simple experiments involving homogeneous experimental units and a single controlled variable will be used to introduce many concepts and methods that also apply to more complex experiments.</page>
