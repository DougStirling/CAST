<page dir='en/normalModel' filePrefix='normalModel1'>Varying the values of the controlled factors causes some variability in the response -- explained variation. In some kinds of experiment, there is known structure to the experimental units that also results in explained variation. Other variation remains unexplained.</page>
<page dir='en/normalModel' filePrefix='normalModel2'>Explained variation in the response is modelled with a function for the response mean that involves the levels of the factors (constants) and some unknown parameters. Unexplained variation is modelled with a probability distribution.</page>
<page dir='en/normalModel' filePrefix='normalModel3'>In normal models, the response is the sum of a component that depends on on the experimental factors and structure of the experimental units, and an error term that a normal distribution with mean zero and constant standard deviation.</page>
<page dir='en/normalModel' filePrefix='normalModel4'>The model for the explained variation usually involves unknown parameters. These can be estimated by least squares.</page>
