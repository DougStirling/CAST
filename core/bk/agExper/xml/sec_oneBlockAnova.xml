<page dir='en/oneBlockAnova' filePrefix='oneBlockAnova1'>The simplest model for a single factor in a randomised block design is very similar to the model without interaction for designs with two factors.</page>
<page dir='en/oneBlockAnova' filePrefix='oneBlockAnova2'>Adding terms to the model for blocks and for the factor reduce the residual sum of squares. Each reduction is the sum of squared differences between the fitted values from two models.</page>
<page dir='en/oneBlockAnova' filePrefix='oneBlockAnova3'>The explained sums of squares for blocks is the sums of squared differences between the block means and overall mean. The treatment sum of squares is similarly the sum of squared differences between the treatment and overall means.</page>
<page dir='en/oneBlockAnova' filePrefix='oneBlockAnova4'>Adding a term for blocks to the model can be thought of as adjusting the values to make all block means equal. The residuals from the full model can be thought of as a further adjustment to make all treatment means equal.</page>
<page dir='en/oneBlockAnova' filePrefix='oneBlockAnova5'>An anova table shows these sums of squares and associated degrees of freedom. The F-ratio for treatments in the table is the basis of a test for equal treatment means. Several examples are given.</page>
<page dir='en/oneBlockAnova' filePrefix='oneBlockAnova6'>The anova table test for equal treatment means is based on a model that makes assumptions about the data. When the unexplained response variation is not constant, a transformation of the response may fit the model better.</page>
<page dir='en/oneBlockAnova' filePrefix='oneBlockAnova7'>If it is concluded that all treatment means are not equal, confidence intervals can be used to report the differences.</page>
