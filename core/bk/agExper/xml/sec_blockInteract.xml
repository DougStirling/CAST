<section name='Interaction between blocks and factor'>


<page dir='en/blockInteract' filePrefix='blockInteract1'>If the blocks are very different from each other, the factor may have a different effect within different blocks. This is called interaction between the block and factor.</page>
<page dir='en/blockInteract' filePrefix='blockInteract2'>Interaction between the effect of blocks and the factor is modeled with an interaction term in the same way as the interaction between two factors. It reduces the residual sum of squares by an amount equal to the sum of squared differences between the fitted values for the models with and without the term.</page>
<page dir='en/blockInteract' filePrefix='blockInteract3'>The explained and residual sums of squares can be presented in an analysis of variance table. The interaction sum of squares is used to test for whether the effect of the factor is the same in all blocks.</page>
