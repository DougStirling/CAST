<page dir='en/unequalReps' filePrefix='unequalReps1'>If some response measurements are missing, the ordinary analysis of variance table can still be used to test whether the level means are equal, provided the probability of a missing value is unrelated to the response that would have been obtained.</page>
<page dir='en/unequalReps' filePrefix='unequalReps2'>If a factor has a control level, it is sometimes replicated more than the other factor levels.</page>
<page dir='en/unequalReps' filePrefix='unequalReps3'>If all treatments have the same replicates, the sums of squares for the two factors do not depend on the order of adding them to the model. The same holds provided the replicates for each level of X are in the same proportion for each level of Z.</page>
<page dir='en/unequalReps' filePrefix='unequalReps4'>If two factors are not orthogonal, there are different analysis of variance tables for the two orders of adding the factors. Both must be examined to fully understand the data.</page>
<page dir='en/unequalReps' filePrefix='unequalReps5'>Provided the replicates of a factor in each block are in proportion, the blocks and factor are orthogonal. However this is less important since blocks are always added to the model before the factor so only a single anova table need be considered.</page>
<page dir='en/unequalReps' filePrefix='unequalReps6'>This section has only considered data with at least one replicate for every treatment. Missing treatments mean that some effects cannot be estimated. In extreme cases, it is impossible to distinguish the effects of different factors -- they are confounded.</page>
