<page dir='en/incomplete' filePrefix='incomplete1'>If each pair of treatments is used together in the same number of blocks, the design is called balanced and all pairs of treatments can be compared with the same accuracy.</page>
<page dir='en/incomplete' filePrefix='incomplete2'>This page gives an example of analysis of variance for a balanced incomplete block experiment.</page>
<page dir='en/incomplete' filePrefix='incomplete3'>The raw treatment means do no describe well the differences between the treatments in incomplete block designs. Adjusted treatment means should be used instead.</page>
<page dir='en/incomplete' filePrefix='incomplete4'>Lattice designs are used in experiments for factors with many levels and relatively small block sizes. In a balanced lattice design, each pair of treatments is used together in one block.</page>
<page dir='en/incomplete' filePrefix='incomplete5'>Subsets of a full balanced lattice design still allow all treatments to be compared.</page>
<page dir='en/incomplete' filePrefix='incomplete6'>Groups of treatments should be allocated to blocks randomly from the rows of a standard design. These treatments should then be randomly allocated to experimental units within each block.</page>
