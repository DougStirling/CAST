<page dir='en/multiComp' filePrefix='multiComp1'>If several hypothesis tests are conducted with the same significance level, the probability of at least one being significant can be much higher. A modification allows the overall significance level to be fixed.</page>
<page dir='en/multiComp' filePrefix='multiComp2'>If it is concluded that the reponse mean depends on the factor level, it is natural to ask which levels differ. If the experiment involves several factor levels, t-tests to compare pairs of means should be avoided -- with many such tests, there is an increased probability of a low p-value for at least one pair of means.</page>
<page dir='en/multiComp' filePrefix='multiComp3'>A wider difference than that suggested by a pairwise comparison should be used when there are several group means to compare.</page>
<page dir='en/multiComp' filePrefix='multiComp4'>A similar adjustment can be made for comparison of treatments in a randomised block design.</page>
<page dir='en/multiComp' filePrefix='multiComp5'>If there is any structure to the factor levels, it is often best to use contrasts to make more meaningful comparisons between the levels.</page>
