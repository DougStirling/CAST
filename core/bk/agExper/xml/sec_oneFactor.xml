<page dir='en/oneFactor' filePrefix='oneFactor1'>In a completely randomised experiment for a single factor, the different levels of the factor are randomly allocated to the pool of experimental units.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactor' filePrefix='oneFactor_b2'>The mean responses at the different factor levels give a summary of the response variation that has been explained by the factor.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactor' filePrefix='oneFactor3'>To fully interpret differences between the treatment means, unexplained variation must also be taken into account. Both explained and unexplained variation can be modelled using a normal model with separate terms for these two types of variation.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactor' filePrefix='oneFactor4'>The amount of unexplained variation is given by the standard deviation of the error term in a normal model. A pooled estimate can be found by combining the observed standard deviations within the separate factor levels.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactor' filePrefix='oneFactor5'>95% confidence intervals for the treatment means take unexplained variation into account and make it easier to compare the factor levels.</page>
