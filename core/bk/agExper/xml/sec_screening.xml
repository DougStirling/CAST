<section name='2**n designs with one replicate'>


<page dir='en/screening' filePrefix='screening1'>A preliminary experiment may be conducted to assess which of many factors are most important. To limit the number of experimental units, each factor is often allowed only 2 levels and a single replicate is used.</page>
<page dir='en/screening' filePrefix='screening2'>Factors with two levels may be treated as numerical with values +1 and -1. The main effects of two factors are orthogonal if the sum of the products of these values is zero.</page>
<page dir='en/screening' filePrefix='screening3'>The interaction between two factors can be modelled by a numerical variable whose values are the product of the coded factor values. The variables for main effects and interactions in a complete factorial design are orthogonal. </page>
<page dir='en/screening' filePrefix='screening4'>If there are no replicates, the significance of factor effects and interactions can only be tested if it can be assumed that there are no high-order interactions. Hypothesis tests are however less important in screening experiments.</page>
