<page dir='en/blockIntro' filePrefix='blockIntro1'>In most experiments, the experimental units that are available differ from each other and this variability results in less accurate estimates of the effect of the treatment.</page>
<page dir='en/blockIntro' filePrefix='blockIntro2'>There is often enough information about differences between the experimental units before the experiment begins to allow them to be grouped into similar blocks of units.</page>
<page dir='en/blockIntro' filePrefix='blockIntro3'>Experiments are sometimes designed to have variable experimental units to give confidence that the conclusions will hold for a wide range of different situations.</page>
<page dir='en/blockIntro' filePrefix='blockIntro4'>Some authors use the term 'replicate' to denote a separate repeat of the whole experiment. Such replicates should be treated as blocks.</page>
