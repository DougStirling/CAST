<page dir='en/covariates' filePrefix='covariates1'>The more variability in the experimental units that is explained by the model used, the greater the accuracy of estimating the effects of the factors of interest.</page>
<page dir='en/covariates' filePrefix='covariates_b2'>Randomisation ensures that the effects of factors are always estimated without bias. However variation between the units getting different treatments can result in very variable estimates if the variation in the experimental units is not modelled.</page>
<page dir='en/covariates' filePrefix='covariates_b3'>Numerical measurements describing variability in the experimental units can be modelled with linear terms in the model.</page>
<page dir='en/covariates' filePrefix='covariates_b4'>There is usually no interest in testing the significance of covariates. Inference about the model terms relating to the factors of interest can be done with confidence intervals and analysis of variance as usual.</page>
<page dir='en/covariates' filePrefix='covariates_b5'>Experimental units can be grouped into blocks and also have covariates. Blocks and covariates should be included in the model before testing the effects of the factors of interest.</page>
<page dir='en/covariates' filePrefix='covariates6'>Categorical covariates are modelled in exactly the same way as blocks. Models can contain several terms explaining different aspects of the variability in the experimental units.</page>
<page dir='en/covariates' filePrefix='covariates7'>'Bad' allocation of treatments to experimental units can sometimes be saved if covariates are recorded and used to reduce unexplained variation.</page>
