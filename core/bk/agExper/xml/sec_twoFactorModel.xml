<page dir='en/twoFactorModel' filePrefix='twoFactorModel1'>The response is modelled using a normal distribution whose mean depends on the factor levels and whose standard deviation is the same for all treatments.</page>
<page dir='en/twoFactorModel' filePrefix='twoFactorModel_b2'>The mean response can be modelled as the sum of two terms, each depending on one of the two factors.</page>
<page dir='en/twoFactorModel' filePrefix='twoFactorModel3'>The response means for the factor levels can be expressed using the mean for a base factor level and differences for the other factor levels.</page>
<page dir='en/twoFactorModel' filePrefix='twoFactorModel_b4'>The response mean can be modelled as the sum of three terms, the mean at base levels of both factors and two terms reflecting the effect of changing the levels of the two factors.</page>
