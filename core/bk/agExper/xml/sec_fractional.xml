<page dir='en/fractional' filePrefix='fractional1'>Designs for k factors in half or quarter of the experimental units required for a complete design should be such that the main effects are orthogonal -- each combination of levels for any two of the factors is used the same number of times.</page>
<page dir='en/fractional' filePrefix='fractional2'>In fractional factorial designs, main effects are confounded with interactions between other factors.</page>
<page dir='en/fractional' filePrefix='fractional3'>A complete factorial design can be augmented with an extra factor whose levels are defined by an interaction between the initial factors. Each original main effect or interaction is confounded with a term involving the added factor.</page>
<page dir='en/fractional' filePrefix='fractional4'>Another example is given in which a complete design is augmented with two additional factors.</page>
<page dir='en/fractional' filePrefix='fractional5'>Similar designs can be constructed for factors with more than two levels, but they are beyond the scope of this e-book.</page>
