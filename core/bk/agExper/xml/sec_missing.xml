<page dir='en/missing' filePrefix='missing1'>If treatments are missing when there are two or more controlled factors, some interaction parameters cannot be estimated.</page>
<page dir='en/missing' filePrefix='missing2'>Missing treatments often result in explained sums of squares that depend on the order of adding terms to the model so there may be several possible anova tables. The marginal sum of squares for each term can be used to help find the best model.</page>
<page dir='en/missing' filePrefix='missing3'>If treatments are missing in some blocks of a randomised block design, the interactions between blocks and factors cannot be fully estimated. However if it is assumed that there is no block-treatment interaction, the effects of the controlled factors can usually still be estimated.</page>
