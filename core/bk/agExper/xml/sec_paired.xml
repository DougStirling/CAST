<page dir='en/paired' filePrefix='paired1'>Groups of similar experimental units are called blocks. A randomised block design consists of a completely randomised design within each block. The special case of blocks of size two (pairs) and a single factor with two levels is particularly easy to analyse.</page>
<page dir='en/paired' filePrefix='paired2'>Experimental units may be grouped into pairs that are 'similar' using any available information. In a randomised block design, one experimental unit in each pair is randomly given each factor level. The resulting estimate of the factor effect is more accurate than in a completely randomised experiment.</page>
<page dir='en/paired' filePrefix='paired3'>With paired data, the differences between the two measurements in each pair hold all information about the effect of the factor. Their average provides an estimate of the factor's effect.</page>
<page dir='en/paired' filePrefix='paired4'>Standard univariate inference methods can be used to test whether the factor affects the response and to find a confidence interval for the factor effect.</page>
