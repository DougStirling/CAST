<page dir='en/practicalIssues' filePrefix='practicalIssues1'>The problem being addressed by a project and its specific objectives should be clearly stated before data are collected. The researcher should also consider how the project results will be used.</page>
<page dir='en/practicalIssues' filePrefix='practicalIssues2'>Depending on the objectives of a project, it may be appropriate to conduct an experiment, a survey or both.</page>
<page dir='en/practicalIssues' filePrefix='practicalIssues3'>In experiments and surveys, data are collected from discrete units. Decisions about which measurements should be made from each unit must be guided by the objectives of the study.</page>
<page dir='en/practicalIssues' filePrefix='practicalIssues4'>When experiments and surveys are conducted with people rather than other types of unit, various practical issues complicate the design.</page>
