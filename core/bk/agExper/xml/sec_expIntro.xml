<page dir='en/expIntro' filePrefix='expIntro1'>In observational studies such as surveys, data are sampled from populations to describe the characteristics of the populations.</page>
<page dir='en/expIntro' filePrefix='expIntro2'>Causal relationships between variables are particularly important since they predict the effect of changing one variable on the other.</page>
<page dir='en/expIntro' filePrefix='expIntro3'>Causal relationships cannot be inferred from observational data since observed relationships may result from the influence of further unrecorded variables.</page>
<page dir='en/expIntro' filePrefix='expIntro4'>In experiments, the values of one variable are under the control of the researcher.</page>
<page dir='en/expIntro' filePrefix='expIntro5'>A well-designed experiment gives the researcher information about how changes to the controlled variable affect the response.</page>
