<p>The e-book ends with a short chapter that describes and  demonstrates a little  distribution theory that underpins analysis 
	of variance.</p>

	<p>The material is much more theoretical 
		and less practical than other CAST chapters. </p>
</div></div>
<p>There is an elegant body of theory that underlies linear models and analysis of variance.  However analysis of 
	variance can be understood without knowledge of its underlying distributions, 
	and the distribution theory is unnecessary for those who only want practical 
	information about models and analysis for experimental data.</p>
