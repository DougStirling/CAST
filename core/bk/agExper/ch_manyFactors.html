<p>The aims of many experiments require assessment of the effects of two or more different factors on the response.</p>
<p>When more than one factor will be varied in an experiment,   it is particularly important that the experiment is well designed. A good design is needed both to allow a full assessment of how the factors affect the response and for efficiency (getting the same accuracy with fewer experimental units).</p>
<p>The design, modelling and analysis of experiments in this chapter introduces concepts that will be extended in later chapters.</p>
<p>This chapter still assumes that nothing is known about the characteristics of the experimental units before the start of the experiment &mdash; they either appear identical or we choose to ignore any differences. (Later chapters  introduces  experimental designs for situations where there is structure in the experimental units.)</p>
