  <p>The values in many data sets are recorded sequentially in time. Examples are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Average age at death of people each month in a large city over a period 
      of 5 years</li>
    <li>Area of rice grown in East Asia each year for the past 15 years</li>
    <li>Weight of every 100th kiwifruit packed during an 8-hour shift</li>
    <li>Number of hospital admissions each day over a period of 5 months</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In such time series data, there is often a time-related pattern to the variability. 
    This may be either a trend towards higher or lower values over time or a pattern 
    that repeats regularly. This aspect of overall variability may be <strong>explained</strong> 
    in terms of the time-ordering of the data. </p>
  <p>Ignoring the time ordering and examining the data with dot plots or similar 
    univariate techniques may result in useful information being missed.</p>
  <p>Time series data are most common in business applications, so this chapter 
    goes into less depth about analysis of time series than the other versions 
    of CAST.</p>
