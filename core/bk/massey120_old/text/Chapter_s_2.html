<p>Variation in data is not simply an annoyance &mdash; the variation itself can

<img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_dotPlot.gif" width="72" height="324" align="right">
<p class="heading notPrinted">Dot plots</p>
<p>Some ranges of values 
		are more common than others &mdash; they have higher <strong>density</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest graphical display of data that shows where there is high and low density is a <strong>dot
		plot</strong>. This shows each value as a cross (or dot) against a
		numerical axis.</p>
	<p>The gap between 3.4 and 4.9 is more obvious on the right than in a textual
list of values, whether ordered or not.</p>
	<br clear="all">





<h2 class="pageName">2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Jittering the crosses</p>
	<p>In all but the smallest data sets, the crosses on a basic dot plot overlap, making it difficult to identify regions of high density.</p>
	<p>Randomly moving crosses away from the axis reduces this problem by separating the crosses:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_jitteredDotPlot.gif" width="398" height="72"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Note that the vertical jittering is random and therefore tells you nothing about the data.</p>
	




<h2 class="pageName">2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Stacked dot plots</p>
	<p><strong>Stacking</strong> the crosses into columns is usually better than
jittering them.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stackedDotPlot.gif" alt="" width="400" height="150"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Stacking highlights regions of high density well (tall stacks).</p>
	


<h2 class="pageName">2.1.5 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Digits instead of crosses</p>
	<p>Stem and leaf plots are closely related to stacked dot plots. The crosses are replaced by digits that provide a little more detail about the values that they represent.</p>
	<p class=heading>Stems and leaves</p>
	<p>In a stem and leaf plot, the axis is  replaced by a column of 'stems' &mdash; the most significant digits of the values in the data. The digits that replace the crosses are called 'leaves' and give a further significant digit of each value on a stem.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stemLeaf.gif" alt="" width="141" height="165"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>A final refinement is to sort the leaves into increasing order on each stem.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.1.6 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Need for more flexibility</p>
	<p>Sometimes basic stem and leaf plots are not flexible enough
&mdash; there would be either too many or too few rows of leaves to show the varying
density well.</p>
	<p>Repeating each stem 2 times (with leaves 0-4 on the lower copy and leaves
5-9 on the upper one) or 5 times (with leaves 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8-9 on the
different copies) gives intermediate numbers of stems.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_splitStems.gif" alt="" width="550" height="550"><br clear="all">
	</p>



<h2 class="pageName">2.1.7 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Smoothness</p>
	<p>When drawing a stem and leaf plot, the aim is for a smooth shape to the stem
and leaf plot, and this is usually achieved by between 10 and 20 rows of leaves.</p>
	<p class=heading>Drawing by hand</p>
	<p>When data are analysed on a computer, a stacked dot plot usually describes a distribution of values more clearly than a stem and leaf plot.</p>
	<p>However stem and leaf plots are easy to draw by hand:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Decide on the stems to use &mdash; usually between 10 and 20 of them.</li>
		<li>Scan down the values identifying the leaf digits and writing them against the value's stem.</li>
		<li>Finally, sort the leaves on each stem into order.<br clear="all">
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>To simplify drawing, values are truncated to give their stems and leaf digits,
not rounded. For example, 7.98 and 7.90 would both be displayed as leaf '9' on
the stem '7'.</p>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Outliers</p>
	<p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data are 
		called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
	<p>An outlier may have been 
		incorrectly recorded, or there may have been other anomalous circumstances
associated with it. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything
atypical can be found, outliers should be deleted from the data set and their
deletion noted in any reports about the data.</p>

&mdash; positively skew if the long tail is to the right and negatively skew if the

an outlier.</dd>

<h2 class="pageName">2.2.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>If a dot plot, stem and leaf plot or histogram separates into two or more
groups of  values (clusters), this suggests that there may be more fundamental
differences between the 'individuals' in the groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_clusters.gif" width="499" height="140"></p>
	<p>Further investigation	should be made of	the individuals in the  clusters to find whether they also differ in other ways.</p>
	<p>If the clusters were less distinct, especially in small data sets, you would need external supporting evidence before concluding that the individuals separated into meaningful groups.</p>

  


<h2 class="pageName">2.2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Distribution of values</p>
	<p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, the <strong>distribution
of values</strong>  also contains useful information. Important features
are:</p>
<ul>
		<li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
		<li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
		<li>Whether a distribution is <strong>symmetric</strong> or  <strong>skew</strong> — do the tails appear similar at both sides?</li>
		<li>Other aspects of the <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 
		concepts of centre and spread are particularly important.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.4 &nbsp; Names of individuals</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Extra information</p>
<p>When only a single value is known from each individual (or plant, item, etc),
all that can be discovered is the shape of the distribution of these values.</p>
<p>Additional information  about each individuals
may give insight into why some values are bigger or smaller than others. Different
types of information may be available. The simplest is a unique <strong>name</strong> for
the individuals &mdash; a textual label. These names may help us to understand why
values are outliers or group into clusters in a 
dot plot or stem and leaf plot.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.5 &nbsp; Distinguishing known groups</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Multiple groups of individuals</p>
<p>Sometimes we know that the individuals belong to two or more groups before
the data are collected or, equivalently, that they have different values of an
extra categorical variable.</p>
<p>Information about groups is best displayed by plotting the separate groups
against a common axis.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_stackedGroups.gif" width="399" height="348"></p>
<p class="heading">Back-to-back stem and leaf plots</p>
<p>Stem and leaf plots can be used to compare two groups of individuals,
if drawn on different
sides of a common column of stems. (They are less useful if there are three or
more groups.)</p>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Density</p>
	<p>In a stacked dot plot (or stem and leaf plot), the highest stacks contain the most values. These stacks have the highest <strong>density</strong> of values.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_dotPlotCanopy.gif" name="dataImage" width="445" height="220"></p>
<p>Histograms more directly show how density varies along the axis.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.2 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Histograms</p>
<p>In a simple histogram, the axis is split into sub-intervals of equal width called <strong>classes</strong>. A rectangle is drawn above each class with height equal to the number of values  in the class &mdash; the <strong>frequency</strong> of the class.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_histo.gif" width="502" height="349"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.3 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Aim of a 'smooth' histogram</p>
	<p>There is considerable freedom in the choice of histogram classes. The exact
shape depends on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Class width</li>
		<li>Start value for first class</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We usually choose classes with the aim of <strong>smoothness</strong> in the outline

	<p>The choice of 'best' classes is subjective, but...</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If your conclusions about what a histogram tells you about the data  depend on the choice of histogram classes, you are over-interpreting its shape.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.4 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Warning for small data sets</p>
	<p>For small data sets, changing the class width and the starting position for
the first class can give a <strong>surprising amount of variability in histogram
shape</strong>, so be extremely wary of over-interpreting features  such as
clusters or skewness.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is probably better to avoid using histograms unless there is a reasonable number of values &mdash; stacked dot plots are far less likely to mislead you over minor features.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.5 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Relative frequency</p>
	<p>When all histogram classes are of equal width, histograms are often drawn 
		with a vertical axis giving the frequencies (counts) for each class. The vertical axis can alternatively be labelled with the <strong>relative frequencies</strong> (proportions) for the classes.</p>
	<p>(There is no harm in including both axes.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_relFreqHisto.gif" width="420" height="236"></p>
	<p class="heading">Area equals relative frequency</p>
	<p>An important property of histograms is that the proportion of values in one or more classes equals the proportion of the histogram area above these classes.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_area.gif" width="455" height="289"> </p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.6 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Relative frequencies to compare two groups</p>
	<p>Histograms may be superimposed to compare two groups. However if the groups
differ in size,  it is usually more meaningful to compare relative frequencies
(proportions) than the counts in the classes.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Use <strong>relative frequency</strong> histograms to compare groups.</p>

	<p class=heading>Population pyramids</p>
	<p>Relative frequency histograms are also used to describe the distribution of ages in populations. Males and females are separately displayed to the left and right of a central axis, and different sub-populations may be shown in separate 'pyramids'.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.7 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Mixed class widths</p>
<p>For some data sets, wider classes give a smoother histogram in some ranges of values (e.g. in the tail of a distribution) and narrower classes are better in other parts of the distribution (usually where there is greater density of values).</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p> In a correctly drawn histogram, each value contributes the same area. </p>
</div></div>
<p>Histograms can be drawn with mixed class widths, but it would be <strong>badly misleading</strong> to make the rectangle heights equal to either the class frequency or relative frequency.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.8 &nbsp; Understanding histograms</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Area and proportion of values</p>
<p>The details of drawing histograms by hand with varying class widths are unimportant

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.9 &nbsp; Frequency polygons</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Frequency polygons</p>
<p>A <strong>frequency polygon</strong> is closely related to a histogram with equal class widths. It joins the midpoints of the tops of the class rectangles and tends to give a smoother outline than the corresponding histogram.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_freqPoly.gif" width="448" height="237"></p>
<p>It is easier to distinguish and compare superimposed frequency polygons for two groups than the corresponding histograms.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.10 &nbsp; Kernel density estimates</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Kernel density estimates</p>
<p>A <strong>kernel density estimate</strong> is an alternative to a histogram that often results in a smoother display of the density of values. Each data value on the axis is replaced by a 'blob' of ink (kernel) and these kernels are stacked.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_kernel.gif" width="349" height="263"></p>
<p>The widths of the kernels can be adjusted &mdash; if they are too narrow, the display becomes jagged, but if they are too wide, the display becomes too spread out and detail is lost.</p>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Displaying moderate or large counts</p>
	<p>For discrete data sets whose values are large counts, a histogram can be
used to give a 'smooth' summary of the shape of the distribution of values.</p>
	<p>If the counts are a bit smaller, the exact definition of the histogram classes becomes important. The class boundaries should end in '.5' to ensure that data values

<h2 class="pageName">2.6.1 &nbsp; Bar charts</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Bar charts</p>
	<p>The main graphical display of categorical data is a <strong>bar chart</strong>. In a bar chart, the height of each bar is equal to the frequency (or equivalently
	relative frequency) of that category.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_barchart.gif" width="540" height="198"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.6.2 &nbsp; Pareto diagrams</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Ordering categories</p>
<p>If the categories have a natural ordering (an <strong>ordinal</strong> categorical variable), this ordering should be used in a bar chart.</p>
	<p>For <strong>nominal</strong> categorical variables (no natural ordering),
alphabetic ordering of the categories should be avoided. It is better to sort
them in order of decreasing frequencies, giving a <strong>Pareto diagram</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Detecting 'important' categories</p>
	<p>Pareto diagrams are particularly useful in industrial quality control and 
		quality improvement where information is collected about the causes of problems 
		in manufacturing processes. The <strong>Pareto principle</strong> states that:</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A large percentage of instances of any problem result from a small 
				percentage of the possible causes.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The leftmost categories in a Pareto diagram are most important. A line is usually added  showing the <strong>cumulative</strong> proportions for the different causes. For the <em>i</em>'th category, the height 
	of the line gives the proportion of problems from <strong>any</strong> of the <em>i</em> most common categories.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_pareto.gif" width="462" height="323"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.6.3 &nbsp; Chartjunk and misleading bar charts</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Chartjunk</p>
	<p><span style="float:right; padding:10px"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/univarCat/images/simpleBarchart.gif" id="gif_image_6_3_4" width="162" height="147"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/univarCat/images/simpleBarchart.svg" id="svg_image_6_3_4" width="162" height="147" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_6_3_4");</script></span>Bar charts can be very simple and need not take up much space in reports. Avoid the temptation to embellish them 'artistically' to make them more 
		visually appealing. These additions are collectively called <strong>chartjunk</strong>.</p>
	<p>Chartjunk adds 'noise' to a bar chart and  makes it harder to read
the real information that is contains. Rather than adding chartjunk, draw it
small or replace it with a frequency table.</p>
<p>A common form of chartjunk arises when each bar is drawn as a 3-dimensional
 object. When the resulting 3-dimensional picture is rotated, it often becomes
 harder to compare the heights of bars and to read off values from the axes.
In  particular, <strong>perspective views should be avoided</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><span class="centred"><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_perspectiveBars.gif" width="374" height="376"></span></p>
	<p class="heading">Replacing bars with objects</p>
	<p>A more serious problem arises when the rectangular bars in a barchart are
replaced with pictures of objects. This often visually mis-represents the proportions
in the different categories &mdash; the visual importance of a bar is determined by
its area or volume, not its height.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_carrots.gif" width="448" height="334"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.6.4 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts and pie charts</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Other displays of categorical data</p>
	<p>A <strong>stacked bar chart</strong> is simply a bar chart whose bars are
 stacked on top of each other. Stacked bar charts are often used to compare
two or more groups of individuals.</p>
<p>A <strong>pie chart</strong>, splits a circle  into segments according 
		to the proportions in the categories. The <strong>angle</strong> for a category is given by its proportion.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_barPieStack.gif" width="454" height="123"></p>
	<p>In all three displays, the area 
	of ink for any category equals the proportion of values in that category.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.6.5 &nbsp; Comparison of bar and pie charts</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading  notPrinted">Bar charts and pie charts highlight different aspects of 
		the data</p>
	<p>Although a bar chart and a pie chart are visual representations of the same 
		values (the proportions in the categories), they <strong>highlight different
features</strong>	of these proportions.</p>
<p>Bar charts provide better comparisons of the individual proportions, whereas 
		pie charts allow us to assess the proportions in two or more adjacent categories. The latter is particularly useful if the categories are ordered or split into meaningful groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_barPie.gif" width="550" height="258"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.6.6 &nbsp; Chartjunk for pie charts</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Chartjunk</p>
	<p>Resist the temptation to 'enhance' pie charts with <strong>chartjunk</strong>. In particular, 3-dimensional pie charts can over-emphasise 
		the categories closest to the viewer.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_explodedPie.gif" alt="" width="418" height="306"></p>
	<p>In general, it is better to draw a standard pie chart smaller rather than embellishing 
		it with chartjunk.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><span class="centred"><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_goodPie.gif" width="374" height="122"></span></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.6.7 &nbsp; Bar and pie charts for quantities</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Bar charts for quantities</p>
	<p>Bar charts are most often used to show frequencies for discrete or categorical
 data but they can be used to display any <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('transform3')">quantity
 data</a>. (Quantity data are 'amounts' of something and are always positive.
They are  also called <strong>ratio variables</strong>.)</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/univarCat/images/s_quantities.gif" width="502" height="318"></p>
<p class="heading">Pie charts for quantities</p>
	<p>Pie charts can also be used to display quantity data, but there is an additional 
		requirement that must be satisfied before a pie chart is used. <strong>The total 
			of all the data that are displayed must itself be meaningful</strong>.</p>
	<p>In the published pie chart below, the individual values are death rates per 100,000 live births, so their total is meaningless. A pie chart therefore <strong>should  not have been used</strong>.</p>
