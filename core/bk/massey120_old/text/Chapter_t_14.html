<h1>Chapter 14 &nbsp; Contingency Tables</h1>
<h2>14.1 &nbsp; Independence</h2>
<h3>14.1.1 &nbsp; Association</h3>
<p>Two categorical variables, X and Y, are associated (related) when the conditional distribution of Y given X=x is different for different values of x. Knowing the value of X therefore tells you something about Y.</p>
<h3>14.1.2 &nbsp; Independence</h3>
<p>When the conditional distribution of Y is the same for all values of X, the variables are called independent. This special case is of practical importance.</p>
<h3>14.1.3 &nbsp; Independence from samples</h3>
<p>Independence is a population property. To assess independence from a sample contingency table, the observed cell counts are compared to those estimated from a model with independence.</p>
<h3>14.1.4 &nbsp; Testing for independence</h3>
<p>The raw sum of squared differences between observed and estimated cell counts is not a good test statistic.</p>
<h3>14.1.5 &nbsp; Chi-squared test statistic</h3>
<p>The 'chi-squared' statistic is a modified sum of squared differences that has a standard distribution (a chi-squared distribution) when there is independence.</p>
<h3>14.1.6 &nbsp; P-value for chi-squared test</h3>
<p>The chi-squared statistic can be used to find a p-value for testing independence. The p-value has similar interpretation and properties to p-values for all other hypothesis tests.</p>
<h3>14.1.7 &nbsp; Examples</h3>
<p>The chi-squared test is applied to a few real data sets. When the variables are found to be associated, the nature of the relationship is described from a comparison of observed and estimated cell counts.</p>
<h3>14.1.8 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h3>
<p>The chi-squared test assesses independence of two categorical variables. It is also used to test whether a single categorical variable has the same distribution in several groups.</p>
