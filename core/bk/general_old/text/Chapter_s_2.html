<p class="heading">Unhelpful detail when comparing groups</p>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain a lot of detail about
the distribution of values in a data set. This level of detail is useful when
examining a single data set, but when several groups of values are being compared,
the detail distracts from the main differences between the groups.</p>
<p>For example, the jittered dot plots below do not concisely summarise the differences
between the five groups.</p>

<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_clusters.gif" width="448" height="221"> </p>
	<p>We will describe centre and spread with numerical 
		values called <strong>summary statistics</strong>. They provide particularly
concise and meaningful comparisons of different groups.</p>

<p class="heading">Simple summaries of centre and spread</p>

		<dd>The <strong>range</strong> (maximum - minimum) and <strong>interquartile

	<p class=heading>Information from median and interquartile range</p>

<p class=heading>Median</p>

	<p class=heading>Mean</p>
	<p>The mean  is: </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/meanEqn.gif" width="70" height="35"> </p>
	<p>If each value in a dot plot was a solid object resting on a beam with negligible mass, the mean is the value at which the beam will balance.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_balance.gif" width="451" height="139"> </p>
	<p>The  standard deviation  is denoted by the letter <span class="black em">s</span>  and
is defined by:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/sdDefn.gif" width="115" height="52"></p>
	<p>The numerator, <span class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/ssqDevns.gif" width="70" height="26"></span>, depends on the distances of the values to the mean, so it will be small if the values are all close to the mean and big if they are far from the mean.</p>
	<p class="heading">Variance</p>
	<p>The square of the standard deviation, <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, is called the
sample <strong>variance</strong>. Variances are sometimes reported and used but
standard deviations are easier to interpret since they have  the same units as
the original data (e.g. kilograms or dollars).</p>

 


<h2 class="pageName">2.5.6 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">'Quarter-range' rule of thumb</p>
	<p>For many data sets, the standard deviation is just under 
		a quarter of the range.</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations2.gif" width="454" height="158"></td>
	</tr>
</table></div>

	<p>This is a simple rule, but is only very approximate. The standard deviation 
		can be more than a quarter the range in distributions with short tails or 
		much less if there are long tails or outliers.</p>
	<p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb</p>
	<p>The <strong>70-95-100 rule</strong> is more accurate. In many distributions, </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Approximately 70% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
		<li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
		<li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule holds approximately for most reasonably symmetric data 
		sets, but for skew data or distributions with long tails, outliers or clusters, it is often less accurate.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.5.7 &nbsp; Understanding means and st devns</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>Understanding the
		definition of the standard deviation is much less important than knowing
its properties and having a feel for what its numerical value tells you about
the data. </p>
	<p class="heading">Guessing <em>s</em> from histogram</p>
<p>About 95% of the values should 
		be within 2<em>s</em> of the mean, so after dropping the top 2.5% 
		and bottom 2.5% of the values (histogram area), the remainder should 
		span approximately 4<em>s</em>. Dividing this range by 4 should 
		approximate the standard deviation.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/guessSD.gif" width="288" height="154"> </p>
	<p class="heading">Sketching a histogram from the mean and <em>s</em></p>
<p>Similarly, you should 
		be able to draw a rough sketch of a symmetric histogram with any mean and
standard deviation that you are given. (It would be centred on the mean and 95%
of the area would be within 2<em>s</em> of this.)</p>

	<p>Many different distributions have the same mean and standard deviation.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_anscombe.gif" width="399" height="435"> </p>
	<p>The units of the variance are the <strong>square</strong> of 
		the units of the original values. For example, if the values are weights,
the standard deviation might be 6 kg, but the variance would be 36 <strong>square
kg</strong>. Since its units are easier to interpret, standard deviations are
more easily understood measures of spread, but variances are important in  advanced
statistics. (An important collection of methods for analysing relationships between
variables is called <strong>analysis of variance</strong>.)</p>
<p class="heading">Degrees of freedom (optional)</p>
	<p>The divisor (<em>n</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) in the formula for the sample standard

<p>If a power transformation with <em>p</em> &gt; 1 is applied to data with a
