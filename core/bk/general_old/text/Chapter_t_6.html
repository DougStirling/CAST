<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Multivariate Data</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Displaying multivariate data</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Representing a third variable</h3>
<p>A third numerical variable can be represented in a scatterplot by use of different symbols or colours.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Rotating 3D scatterplots</h3>
<p>Three numerical variables can be displayed in a 3-dimensional scatterplot; this may be rotated to help understand the relationships in the data.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; Scatterplot matrix and brushing</h3>
<p>An array of scatterplots of all pairs of variables is often informative, especially if the scatterplots are dynamically linked.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Brushing example</h3>
<p>'Brushing' refers to dynamic highlighting of the same individuals in multiple linked displays.</p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; Slicing</h3>
<p>Slicing is another dynamic technique. Only observations within a range of values of one variable (a slice) are displayed in linked displays.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Groups and regression</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Additional variables in regression</h3>
<p>Correlation and least squares are used to describe the relationship between two numerical variables. Additional measurements from each individual can potentially help to refine our understanding of the relationship.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Displaying groups</h3>
<p>Different symbols or colours can be used to represent a third categorical variable in a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Regression with grouped data</h3>
<p>The relationship between Y and X can be separately described by a least squares line within each group. This should lead to improved prediction of the response if the relationship is different in different groups.</p>
<h3>6.2.4 &nbsp; Parallel regression lines</h3>
<p>If regression lines for the different groups are parallel, it is easy to summarise the group differences numerically and interpret these differences.</p>
<h3>6.2.5 &nbsp; Transformed variables and groups</h3>
<p>Transformations may linearise the relationship between the response and explanatory variables in each group and also give parallel regression lines.</p>
<h3>6.2.6 &nbsp; Grouping with a numerical variable</h3>
<p>A numerical variable can be used to split the individuals into groups.</p>
<h3>6.2.7 &nbsp; Scatterplot matrix with groups</h3>
<p>Groups can also be represented with different symbols or colours on a scatterplot matrix that describes the relationships between 3 or more other variables.</p>
<h2>6.3 &nbsp; Multiple regression</h2>
<h3>6.3.1 &nbsp; More than one explanatory variable</h3>
<p>In many data sets, two or more explanatory variables could potentially affect the response. Using two or more explanatory variables may give more accurate predictions.</p>
<h3>6.3.2 &nbsp; Multiple regression equation</h3>
<p>A simple linear model with a single explanatory variable can be extended with extra terms to explain the additional effect of other explanatory variables.</p>
<h3>6.3.3 &nbsp; Interpreting coefficients</h3>
<p>The slope coefficient associated with an explanatory variable describes its effect if all other variables are held constant. It may have a different sign from the correlation coefficient between the variable and the response.</p>
<h3>6.3.4 &nbsp; Scatterplot of three variables</h3>
<p>The relationship between a response variable and two explanatory variables can be effectively displayed in a rotating 3-dimensional scatterplot.</p>
<h3>6.3.5 &nbsp; Regression plane</h3>
<p>The equation of a linear model for Y in terms of X and Z can be displayed as a plane in 3-dimensions.</p>
<h3>6.3.6 &nbsp; Fitted values and residuals</h3>
<p>The residuals are vertical distances from the crosses on a 3-dimensional scatterplot to the plane representing the model.</p>
<h3>6.3.7 &nbsp; Least squares estimation</h3>
<p>An objective estimation method is to minimise the sum of squared residuals -- the principle of least squares.</p>
<h2>6.4 &nbsp; Marginal relationships</h2>
<h3>6.4.1 &nbsp; Misleading marginal correlation</h3>
<p>Variables Y and X may be positively correlated overall, but have zero or even negative correlation at each value of a categorical variable, Z. The variable Z is called a lurking (or hidden) variable.</p>
<h3>6.4.2 &nbsp; Misleading marginal difference in means</h3>
<p>A lurking variable can also distort the difference between the means of Y in two groups (i.e. for two values of a categorical variable, X).</p>
<h3>6.4.3 &nbsp; Simpsons paradox</h3>
<p>If X, Y and Z are all categorical, a reversal of the marginal relationship between X and Y and their conditional relationships for different values of Z is called Simpson's paradox.</p>
<h3>6.4.4 &nbsp; Other examples with lurking variables</h3>
<p>A few extra examples are shown where a hidden variable, Z, can result in a misleading conclusion from the marginal relationship. A full analysis using Z is always more complex but is essential to understand the relationship.</p>
