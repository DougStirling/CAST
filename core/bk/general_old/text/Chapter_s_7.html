<h2 class="pageName">7.1.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Population and census</p>
	<p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
		fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
		group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
	<p>Collecting measurements  from every item in the  population is called a <strong>census</strong>. A census is rarely feasible,  because of the  cost and time involved.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
	<p>We can usually obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
	collecting information from a selection of units from the population &mdash; a <strong>sample</strong>. Although a sample gives less accurate information than a census, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample  is  
		a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In it, each unit has the same chance 
		of being selected and some random mechanism is used to determine whether any particular unit is 
		included in the sample.	</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	<p>It is convenient 
		to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
		than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
		corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/popSamp/images/s_popSamp.gif" width="550" height="267"></p>
	<p class="heading">Sample information about the population</p>
	<p>In practice, we only have a single sample and this provides  <strong>incomplete information about the population</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/popSamp/images/samplingHistos2.gif" width="423" height="120"></p>
	<p class="heading">Effect of sample size</p>
	<p>Bigger samples mean more stable and reliable information about the underlying population.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.1.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Estimating means and proportions</p>
	<p>A random sample is often used to <strong>estimate</strong> some  numerical characteristic of the population, such as...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The mean of some variable</li>
		<li>The proportion in some category</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The difference between an estimate and the population value being estimated is called 
		its <strong>sampling error</strong>. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/popSamp/images/s_propnMean.gif" width="494" height="394"></p>
	<p class="heading">Bar charts and the law of large numbers</p>
	<p>The law of large numbers states that sample proportions approach  the underlying probabilities as the sample size increases. This means that a sample bar chart will be close in shape to the unknown population bar chart if the sample size is big enough.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.3.4 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Histograms and probability density functions</p>
	<p>The situation is a little more complicated for continuous numerical populations and samples. A standard histogram could be used to describe the population in the same way that it might be used for a sample:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probDensity/images/histogram.gif" width="192" height="154"></p>
	<p>However with an infinite population, we can narrow the histogram classes beyond what would be reasonable for a finite sample. Indeed, class widths can be reduced indefinitely, resulting in a smooth histogram called a <strong>probability density function</strong>. This is often abbreviated to a <strong>pdf</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/probDensity/images/pdf.gif" width="192" height="154"></p>
	<p>Probability density functions are still essentially histograms and share all properties of histograms.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.3.5 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Shape of a probability density function</p>
	<p>A probability density function  is usually a fairly smooth curve, though a single sample histogram  provides limited information about its likely shape.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/unknownPopn.gif" width="362" height="236"></p>
	<p>A value can be generated from a rectangular distribution with the Excel function &quot;=RAND()&quot; or, by hand, by  generating a sequence of
	random digits (e.g. by rolling a 10-sided die).</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.4.6 &nbsp; Generating categorical values</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Generating a categorical value</p>
	<p>A random category can be generated from a rectangularly distributed random value, <span class="em black">r</span> .</p>
	<p>If P(<em>success</em>)  is denoted by the symbol <span class="black">π</span>, 
		then a <em>success</em> will be generated if <span class="em black">r</span>  is less than <span class="black">π</span>. This can be generalised as illustrated in the diagram below:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_randomCat.gif" width="340" height="274"></p>
	<p>A random position within the rectangle is generated with a random rectangular horizontal and vertical positions. If it lies within the density function, the x-coordinate is the generated value. Otherwise more positions within the rectangle are generated until a point is found within the density function.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probSim/images/s_envelopeReject.gif" width="413" height="234"></p>
	<p> can badly underestimate the variability (and hence accuracy) of the sample 
		mean of dependent random samples.</p>
	<p>Always check that a random sample is independently selected from the whole 
		population before using the formula for the standard deviation of the sample mean.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.5.8 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling with replacement from finite populations</p>
	<p>When  a random sample is selected <strong>with replacement</strong> from a finite 
		population, the sample values are independent and the standard 
		deviation of the sample mean is again</p>
	<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position:relative; top:12px"><img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline"></span></p>
	<p>Note however that the population  standard deviation, σ, 
		uses divisor <em>N</em>, the number of values in the population, rather than (<em>N</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1).	</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" width="114" height="49"></p>
<p class="heading">Sampling without replacement from finite populations</p>
	<p>When a sample is selected <strong>without replacement</strong>, successive values are no longer independent &mdash; if a large value is selected, it cannot be selected again, so the next value will tend 
	to be lower.</p>
	<p>For sampling without replacement, a different formula should be used for the standard deviation of the sample mean:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/randomMean/images/sdMeanSWOR.gif" width="138" height="45"></p>
	<p>The quantity (<em>N </em>- <em>n</em>) / (<em>N</em> - 1) is called the <strong>finite 
		population correction factor</strong>. It can usually be ignored if only a small fraction of the population is sampled (say under 5%).</p>

<p class="heading">Normal distribution parameters</p>
	<p>The <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('probDensity5')">family of 
		normal distributions</a> consists of symmetric bell-shaped distributions that 
		are defined by two parameters, µ 
		and σ, the distribution's mean and standard deviation.</p>
	<p class="heading">Normal distributions as models for data</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/probDensity/images/s_bestFit.gif" width="404" height="202"></p>
	<p>or equivalently, </p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>x</em> &nbsp;=&nbsp; &mu; &nbsp;+&nbsp; <em>z</em> &times; &sigma;</span> </p>
	<p class="heading">Probabilities and z-scores</p>
	<p>Any  probability (area) relating to a normally distributed random variable, <em>X</em>, can be expressed in terms of z-scores:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/normalDistn/images/s_zProb.gif" width="502" height="298"></span></p>
<p>If <em>X</em> has a normal distribution, then <i>Z</i> has a <strong>standard 
		normal distribution</strong> with mean µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 
	and standard deviation σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. </p>
	<p class="heading">Probabilities for the standard normal distribution</p>
	<p>After translating a probability about <em>X</em> into one about a z-score, it is easier to evaluate it.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/normalDistn/images/s_xProb.gif" width="509" height="436"> </p>
	<p>The fact that both <span class="em black">x</span>  and <span class="em black">p</span>  are approximately normally distributed in large samples is justified below.</p>
	<p class="heading">Proportions and means</p>
	<p>If we assign a code of '1' to the successes and '0' to the failures in the 
		random sample, then the resulting values are called an <strong>indicator variable</strong>. Its mean is identical to the proportion of successes. </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/randomPropn/images/propnAsMeanEqn.gif" width="397" height="100"> </p>
	<p>Since the proportion of successes in a sample is a kind of mean, its distribution is close to a normal distribution if the sample size is large enough.<br>

<h2 class="pageName">7.8.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling frame</p>
	<p>Before taking a simple random sample or stratified random sample, a complete 
		list of all individuals in the target population must be available. This is called a <strong>sampling 
			frame</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
	<p>If a complete sampling frame is not available, it may be possible to group the target individuals into reasonably 
	small groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>, for which a complete list is available.</p>
	<p>Clusters are similar to the strata that are used for stratified sampling, but 
		are usually much smaller. For example, a cluster might contain all of the houses in a street, or all of the individuals in a household. It is not necessary to know beforehand how many individuals are in each of the clusters.</p>
	<p>For cluster sampling, a <strong>simple random sample of clusters</strong> is 
		selected, with all individuals in these clusters selected.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cost advantages</p>
	<p>Even when a complete sampling frame is available, cluster sampling might be 
		used to reduce the cost of sampling (or to increase the sample size for the same 
		cost) since it is often cheaper to record information from individuals in the 
		same cluster than from different parts of the sampling frame.</p>
	<p class="heading">Accuracy of cluster sampling</p>
	<p>The disadvantage of cluster sampling is that estimates are usually less accurate than the corresponding estimates from 
	a simple random sample of the same size.</p>
	<p>However the cost advantages would permit a larger sample size, so cluster sampling may give the best estimates <strong>for a fixed cost</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.8.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Sampling from large populations</p>
	<p>Two-stage sampling is a sampling scheme that is related to cluster sampling, 
		but is of most use for large populations when the individuals are very widely 
		separated in some sense. For example, many polls are conducted to obtain <strong>national</strong> information about voting intentions or consumer purchases, and there is a high 
		cost associated with travelling between different regions.</p>
	<p>In two-stage sampling, the population is separated into groups of adjacent 
		individuals called <strong>primary sampling units</strong>. These primary sampling 
		units are typically large &mdash; for example a country might be split into 20 or more 
		regions. A small number of these are selected according to some sampling scheme, 
		then individuals are sub-sampled within each selected primary unit.</p>
	<p>Costs are reduced by limiting sampling to a small number of primary units. 
		For example, if individuals are only sampled from within say 5 regions, travelling 
		and accommodation costs will be considerably reduced.</p>
	

<h2 class="pageName">7.8.4 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Estimation</p>
	<p>The aim of sampling is usually to <strong>estimate</strong> one or more population 
		values (parameters) from a sample. Because we do not have complete information about the population, the estimate is unlikely to be <strong>exactly</strong> same as the value that we are estimating, 
		so we call the difference the <strong>error</strong> in the estimate. There are 
		different kinds of error.</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling error</p>
	<p>We have presented four different ways to sample from a population</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Simple random sample</li>
		<li>Stratified sample</li>
		<li>Cluster sample</li>
		<li>Two-stage sample</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each of these involves randomness in the sample-selection process. The error caused by randomness in the sampling process is called <strong>sampling 
			error</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Non-sampling error</p>
	<p>When sampling from some types of population &mdash; especially human populations 
		&mdash; problems often arise when conducting one of the above sampling schemes. For 
		example, some sampled people are likely to refuse to participate in your study.</p>
	<p>Such difficulties also result in errors and these are called <strong>non-sampling 
		errors</strong>. Non-sampling errors can be much higher than sampling errors 
		and are much more serious. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike sampling errors, the likely size of non-sampling errors cannot be estimated 
			from a single sample &mdash; it is extremely difficult to assess their likely size.</li>
		<li>Non-sampling errors often distort estimates by pulling them in one direction. 
			The estimates are then called <strong>biased</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is therefore important to design a survey to minimise the risk of non-sampling 
		errors.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.8.5 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
	<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
		from some members of the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>
	<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
		the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
		the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
		only a subgroup of it.</p>
	<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>
	<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Failure to contact the individuals.</li>
		<li>Refusal to participate in the study.</li>
		<li>Refusal to answer particular questions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
		survey are likely to be biased.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.8.6 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>'Inaccurate' responses</p>
	<p>The next two types of non-sampling error are caused by inaccurate information 
		being obtained from the sampled individuals.</p>
	<p class=heading>Instrument error</p>
	<p><strong>Instrument error</strong> usually results from poorly designed
		questions. Different wording of questions can lead to different answers being 
		given by a respondent. The wording of the question may be such as to elicit some
		particular response (a <strong>leading</strong> question) or it may simply be carelessly
		worded so that it is misinterpreted by some respondents. </p>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer error</p>
	<p><strong>Interviewer error</strong> occurs when some characteristic of the interviewer, such
		as age or sex, affects the way in which respondents answer questions.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.8.7 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>There are various different ways to collect information from human populations. 
	Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
	<p class=heading>Telephone</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response can be high.</li>
		<li>Coverage error is small.</li>
		<li>The number of questions must be kept very small.</li>
		<li>Inexpensive, so sample sizes can be greater.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Mailed questionnaire</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response is very high.</li>
		<li>Costs are higher than in a telephone survey.</li>
		<li>Mailed questionnaires can contain more questions than telephone surveys.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lowest non-response and other sampling errors.</li>
		<li>Interviewers must be well trained to reduce interviewer error.</li>
		<li>Most expensive.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires can be fairly long.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Houses are rarely selected at random. Often streets are randomly selected and every
		5th or 10th house in the street is approached. This is called a <strong>systematic
			sample</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Street corner</p>
	<p>Some surveys are conducted by approaching people in busy shopping centres or
		similar public places. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Large coverage errors.</li>
		<li>Least expensive and therefore widely used.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires must be small.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To reduce coverage errors, a <strong>quota sample</strong> is often used. Each 
		interviewer is told to interview fixed numbers of old, young, male, female, etc. 
		respondents to match the 
		corresponding proportion in the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Self-selected</p>
	<p>Phone-in or mail-in surveys are often conducted by radio stations and magazines. The
		respondents are usually so unrepresentative that the results are meaningless. These types
		of survey should be avoided. </p>

<h2 class="pageName">7.9.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Statistics for complex problems</p>
	<p>In practice, problems are rarely  well-defined and there may be various 
		different ways to collect data to throw light on them.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do we reduce hospital waiting lists?</li>
		<li>How do you design an ultrasonic sound generator to repel mice?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Collection and analysis of data to help attack the problem usually suggest 
		further questions for which further data are required. Several cycles of data 
		collection and analysis are usually needed, with considerable input from an expert 
		in the problem area between each cycle of the process. </p>
	<p class="heading">Continuous quality improvement</p>
	<p>In business 
		and industry, statistics is an important part of the long-term <strong>monitoring</strong> of performance. We may simply want to ensure that systems continue to perform at their current 
		levels, or the aim may be to <strong>improve</strong> aspects of the system. 
		The latter is often called <strong>continuous quality improvement</strong> or <strong>total quality management</strong>.</p>
	<p>Problems in a process are usually detected by collecting and analysing <strong>data</strong> about the performance of the system. This section describes the use of <strong>control charts</strong> as a way to monitor processes.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.9.2 &nbsp; Run charts</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Inherent variability</p>
	<p>A certain level of variability in any process is unavoidable. We say that this 
		'acceptable' level of variability is a result of <strong>common causes</strong> (or <strong>random causes</strong>) and if it is the only source of variability, 
		the process is said to be <strong>in control</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Systematic changes</p>
	<p>Our aim is to detect changes to the output that are <strong>not</strong> the 
		result of common causes. Such systematic changes are said to be the result of <strong>special causes</strong> (or <strong>assignable causes</strong>) and 
		could result in... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>movement in the process mean (either abruptly or steadily over time),</li>
		<li>single outliers, or</li>
		<li>changes to the process variability</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Systematic changes usually indicate problems with the quality of the output and the process is said to be <strong>out of control</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Run chart</p>
	<p>A <strong>control chart</strong> plots   measurements describing the process in time order &mdash; a type of time series plot. We hope to use it to quickly detect problems and adjust the process to maintain quality. If a single value is recorded at each time, the control chart is called a <strong>run chart</strong>. (Other control charts plot sample means and ranges.)</p>
<p>The challenge is to detect systematic 
		changes in the control chart (due to special causes) over the background level of 
		variability (due to common causes).</p>
	<p>In the example below, the manager has determined that an output measurement should 'almost always' be between 2,000 and 2,080 with variability in this range considered to be due to common causes. Two out of the last four values were above the upper limit, suggesting a problem with the process that should be investigated and fixed.</p>
	<p class="eqn">																										<img src="../../../en/controlChart/images/s_outliers.gif" width="553" height="302"></p>
	<p>By setting the upper and lower control limits to be 3 standard deviations
		on either side of the process mean, we avoid many 'false alarms' when the process is
		in control. This is important since values outside the control limits would trigger an examination of the 
		production process &mdash; possibly a costly exercise.</p>
	<p class="heading">Shape of the distribution</p>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb is most accurate for reasonably symmetric, bell-shaped distributions, though values more than 3 standard deviations from the mean are rare for all distributions. However these control limits should be avoided for very skew distributions &mdash; consider transforming  the data before producing 
	a run chart.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.9.4 &nbsp; Other signals of being out-of-control</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Additional triggers for an out-of-control process </p>
	<p>The most commonly used indication of a process being out-of-control is a  
		value outside the upper and lower control limits (more than three standard deviations 
		away from the centre line). This is sensitive to changes to the process mean 
		or increases in the process variability. </p>
	<p>Additional triggers have been proposed that are also sensitive to systematic
		changes in a process. These are all based
		on successive values within 1, 2 or 3 standard deviations from the centre (Zones C, B or A).	</p>

<h2 class="pageName">7.9.8 &nbsp; Control charts for ranges</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Detecting changes to process variability</p>
	<p>A control chart of sample means is used to detect shifts in the 'centre' of 
		a process. In a similar way, a control chart to assess whether the process <strong>variability</strong> has changed can be based on the spread of successive samples. </p>
	<p>The most commonly used control chart for process variability is based on the <strong>sample ranges</strong>.</p>

	<p>By separately targetting the process centre and variability with  control charts for means
and  ranges, we can get better indications of any changes in the performance
of the process, and we can therefore intervene more promptly to correct potential drops
in quality. </p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.9.9 &nbsp; Finding the cause of problems</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Finding the <span class="red">cause</span> of problems</p>
	<p>Control charts (and other collected data) may indicate problems with a system. 
		However, after detection of a problem, its <strong>cause</strong> must be 
		identified in order to rectify it. This is usually a non-trivial exercise 
		and the following tools often help.</p>
<p class="heading">Brainstorming</p>
	<p>In a <strong>brainstorming</strong> session, all team 
		members contribute short phrases that are written on either a large sheet of paper 
		or individual scraps of paper (post-it notes are good). The points should be written 
		down without discussion or editing, and all team members should be encouraged 
		to contribute.</p>
	<p>Once these ideas have been written down, they must be structured or grouped 
		in some way.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cause-and-effect diagrams</p>
	<p>After possible causes for a problem have been contributed in a brainstorming 
		session, they can be structured in a <strong>cause-and-effect</strong> diagram (also called  a <strong>fishbone</strong> diagram).</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/controlChart/images/fishbone4.gif" width="484" height="377" class="summaryPict"></p>
<p>This structuring of possible causes helps to focus attention on the most likely 
		causes and on ones that may be altered in the 'Do' step in the Plan-Do-Check-Act 
		cycle.</p>
