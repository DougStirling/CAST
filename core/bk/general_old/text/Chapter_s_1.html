<p class="heading">What is the purpose of Statistics?</p>
<p>When non-statisticians think of statistics, the first thing that usually 
	comes to mind is data. Large amounts of economic, social and administrative data
are routinely collected and published. Most researchers also collect data. Statistical
analysis uses data, but <strong>the data are not the goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Data are the basic commodity of the statistics. Without data, there is no 
	information on which to reach conclusions or base decisions.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data contain information.<br>
<strong>The purpose of statistics is to extract information from data.</strong></p>
</div></div>
<p>Large data sets must be summarised before patterns and relationships can 
	be seen. In smaller data sets, the problem 
	is usually that there is not enough information to get a clear answer to questions
of importance. Statistical methods are needed to describe precision and to ensure
that the highest precision is obtained.</p>
<p class="heading">Context</p>
<p>In general, <strong>users</strong> of statistics are neither interested in data
or in statistical methods, but are only interested in questions <strong>in their
own subject area</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The aim of statistics is to supply useful information to people whose 
	main area of expertise is <span class="red">not</span> statistics.</strong>	Statistical methods are only useful if they can extract information from data 
	to help answer discipline-specific questions. The underlying context is therefore 
	the most important aspect of any statistical analysis.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><strong>If you are not primarily 
			a statistician, you will appreciate statistical methods when they are 
needed in your career!</strong></p>
</div></div>


<h2 class="pageName">1.1.2 &nbsp; Statistics</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Simple series of steps</p>
<p>The simplest application of statistics addresses a single question in 
	the context of some practical subject area.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/simpleProcess.gif" width="384" height="275"></p>
	<p>Statistics has a role to play in all stages of this process.</p>
	<p class="heading">Feedback</p>
	<p>The initial question is usually less well defined and a single 
		pass through the process is not enough. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/feedbackProcess.gif" width="324" height="275"></p>
<p>An example of feedback arises when 
		a small fraction of the data is initially collected and analysed. The information 
		obtained from this <strong>pilot study</strong> is used to refine the data 
collection process.</p>
<p>Another example of feedback  occurs when the initial 
		analysis reveals unusual or unexpected features in the data. Such features 
	may suggest further questions and therefore further data collection.</p>

		


<h2 class="pageName">1.1.3 &nbsp; The statistical process</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Continuous quality improvement</p>
	<p>Statistical analysis is an important part of long-term <strong>monitoring</strong> and <strong>improvement</strong> of
the performance of many types of system. This process is often called <strong>continuous
quality improvement</strong>.</p>
<p>The statistical part of the process again involves a feedback cycle of data collection and analysis, aimed at improving aspects of the system.
</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/pdca.gif" width="463" height="265"></p>
	<p>The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle is most often used in commerce and industry, but
can also be used to 'improve'  many biological and other systems.</p>

<p>These three data sets  have the <strong>same basic structure</strong>, so the
same statistical methods  can be applied to all of them. </p>
<p class="heading">Variables and 'individuals'</p>
<p>Most data sets have a fairly simple structure. One or more measurements (<strong>'variables'</strong>)
are recorded from each of a collection of '<strong>individuals</strong>' (also called <strong>'cases'</strong> or
 '<strong><strong>units</strong></strong>'). The data can 
be presented in a  <strong>data matrix</strong>. </p>
<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/structures/images/dataMatrix.gif" width="258" height="283"> </p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.2 &nbsp; Types of variable</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>Most variables in a data set are either numerical or categorical.</p>
<p class=heading>Numerical variables</p>
<p>These have values that are <strong>numbers</strong> and can 
	be further classified into:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Discrete numerical variable</dt>
	<dd>A variable whose values are <strong>whole numbers</strong> (counts) is 
		called discrete.</dd>
	<dt>Continuous numerical variable</dt>
	<dd>A variable that may contain <strong>any value within some range</strong> is called continuous.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Statistical methods that can be used for continuous variables are not always 
	appropriate for discrete variables.</p>
<p class=heading>Categorical variables</p>
<p>The values of a <strong>categorical</strong> variable are selected from a 
	small group of categories. A further classification is:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Ordinal categorical variable</dt>
	<dd>This arises when the  categories can be<strong> meaningfully ordered</strong>.</dd>
	<dt>Nominal categorical variable</dt>
	<dd>If it does not matter which way its categories are ordered, the variable is
called nominal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most statistical methods for categorical data can be applied to both ordinal 
	and nominal variables.</p>
<p class=heading>Labels</p>
<p>In some data sets, each individual has a unique 'name' that can be used to 
	identify it. We call this a <strong>label variable</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading><span class="blue">Warning!</span></p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When you see a column of numbers in your data matrix, do not 
			assume that it is a numerical variable.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Numbers are sometimes used as <strong>codes</strong> for categorical or label variables.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.3 &nbsp; Categorical variables and groups</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Categorical variables and groups</p>
	<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the individuals in a data set 
	into <strong>groups</strong>. We might treat  individuals with values &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;,
etc. as belonging to different groups.</p>
	<p>Conversely, if data were separately collected from different groups of individuals, 
		the resulting data sets could be combined with a categorical variable distinguishing 
		between the groups. Its values might be defined as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, etc. to identify the group membership of any individual.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A categorical variable and groups are often two ways of representing
the same data.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Data presented in a separate list for each group are  called <strong>unstacked</strong>
whereas if the data are presented
as a single list alongside a categorical variable, they are called <strong>stacked</strong>.</p>


<h2 class="pageName">1.2.4 &nbsp; Meaningful variables</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Defining new variables</p>
<p>When given a data set to analyse,  think about whether 
		its variables are the most useful ones to analyse. Sometimes a simple transformation
provides a variable whose values are more meaningful or highlight a different aspect
of the data.</p>
<p>For example, it is usually more meaningful to compare the population density of countries than either their populations or areas:</p>
	
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="centred" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; color:#000000">
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3"><strong>Density &nbsp; </strong>= &nbsp; </td>
		<td style="text-align:center"><strong>Population</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #000000; line-height:3px; height:3px;"><img src="../../../en/../images/blankSquare.gif" width="481" height="287"></p>
<p>Information can be exchanged between the two data matrices in order to analyse 
	both sets of data together.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Group level &mdash;&gt; individual level</dt>
		<dd>The values of group-level variables could be copied into new variables in the individual-level data matrix.
</dd>
		<dt>Individual level &mdash;&gt; group level</dt>
		<dd>Summaries from each group of individuals, such as <em>household size</em> or <em>maximum age</em> could be added to the group-level data matrix.
	</dd>
	</dl>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Information can be obtained from multi-level data by examining both the group-level and individual-level data matrices.</p>
	</div></div>
	<p>Properly analysing multi-level data and interpreting the results of the analysis
require a lot of careful thought!</p>

	


<h2 class="pageName">1.2.7 &nbsp; Structure of the e-book</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Exploratory data analysis</p>
	<p>The initial chapters of this e-book describe graphical and numerical ways  to explore and 
		summarise  data. Appropriate methods depend on the structure of the data set &mdash; the number 
		and types of its variables.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>One numerical variable</strong> (Chapter 2)</li>
		<li><strong>Two or more numerical variables</strong> (Chapter 3)</li>
		<li><strong>A time series</strong> (Chapter 4)</li>
		<li><strong>One or two categorical variables</strong> (Chapter 5)</li>
		<li><strong>Many variables</strong> (Chapter 6)</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Data collection</p>
	<p>Statisticians should be involved <strong>before</strong> any data are collected. 
		Statistical principles can be applied to the data collection process that 
		ensure that the resulting data can be meaningfully analysed. Chapters 7 and 
		8 explore the idea of random sampling and describe some principles that should be followed in data collection.</p>
	<p class=heading>Inference</p>
	<p>To fully understand the information that is contained in most data sets, we must take account of randomness &mdash; if we collected the data again, the values would often be different. The relevant statistical methods are collectively called <strong>inference</strong>. Again, the details of the statistical analysis depend mostly on the  structure of the data set &mdash; the number and types of its variables.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>One variable</strong> (Chapters 9 and 10)</li>
		<li><strong>Comparing two or more groups</strong> (Chapter 11)</li>
		<li><strong>Two numerical variables</strong> (Chapter 12)</li>
		<li><strong>Two categorical variables</strong> (Chapter 13)</li>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Signal and noise</p>
	<p>Electronics and telecommunications engineers distinguish between the <strong>signal</strong> that is being communicated between two locations and the random <strong>noise</strong> that is added by the communications channel. The noise degrades the signal 
		and, in the worst cases, can make the signal difficult to detect.</p>
	<p>The word &quot;CAST&quot; is hard to read in the following noisy image.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/variation/images/s_noisyText.gif" width="337" height="137"></p>
	<p>Audio equipment often quotes its <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong> as 
		a measure of quality. Noise again deteriorates the signal &mdash; the 'perfect' 
		music that you want to hear. </p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.3.2 &nbsp; Natural variability</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Reasons for variability</p>
	<p>Most statistical data sets contain measurements 
		 from a collection of 'individuals'. These individuals are not identical
so measurements  made from them also vary from individual to individual.</p>
<p>Even when the 'individuals' are very similar,  recorded measurements from 
them often vary due to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Variability of the environment in which the measurements were made</li>
		<li>Variability in the measurement procedure itself<br>
	</li>
	</ul>




<h2 class="pageName">1.3.3 &nbsp; Variability caused by experiments</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>Intentional differences</p>
	<p>In experiments, different 'individuals' are given different <strong>experimental

<p class=heading>Signal and noise in experimental data</p>
	
<p>In experimental data sets, the variability caused by different experimental

<p class=heading>Surveys</p>
	<p>Some types of data are obtained from experiments. In experiments, we actively change some characteristics of each individual &mdash; choosing an experimental treatment.</p>
	<p>Other types of data are obtained by selecting a sample of individuals in
some way and simply recording information about them &mdash; a <strong>survey</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading>Summarising data</p>
	<p>Survey data sets are often large and are  summarised by numerical
values called <strong>summary
statistics</strong>.<br>
	</p>
<p>Natural variability between individuals means that summary statistics 
		 must  be considered as random quantities 
	&mdash; similarly collected data would result in different values.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A important role of statistics is to understand and describe the randomness

<h2 class="pageName">1.3.5 &nbsp; Explained and unexplained variation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Types of variation</p>
<p>The ideas of signal and noise
