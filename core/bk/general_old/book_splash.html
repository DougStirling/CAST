  <p>CAST contains several alternative e-books that cover the material in an introductory statistics course. The 'general' e-book uses data sets and scenarios of general interest, whereas other 
    e-books use examples from specific subject areas.</p>
  <p>Since similar statistical methods are used in most application areas, the 
    statistical concepts covered by the different e-books are mostly the same. 
    You can therefore study any CAST e-book to learn these concepts. However 
    you may find it more interesting to read applications that are related to 
    your professional interests if a more relevant CAST e-book has been written.</p>
  <p>(On some pages, a menu indicated by a downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the page allows you to view different versions of the page.)</p>
