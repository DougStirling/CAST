<p>When data are recorded, we often assume that they arise as a random sample from a normal distribution. Three further standard distributions naturally arise to describe other variables that are defined in terms of normal random samples.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The  variance of a normal random sample has a distribution that is proportional to a <strong>chi-squared distribution</strong>.</li>
	<li>The difference between a normal sample's mean and the underlying distribution mean has a <strong>t distribution</strong> when divided by its standard error, provided this standard error is found using the sample variance.</li>
	<li>The ratio of the variances from two normal samples has a distribution proportional to an <strong>F distribution</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three distributions are of great practical importance since they underlie many commonly used confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. This chapter describes the  distributions and their properties.</p>
