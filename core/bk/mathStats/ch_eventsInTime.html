<p>Traffic accidents, equipment failures, floods and many other kinds of event occur randomly in time. This chapter describes a few standard distributions that arise with these kinds of processes if a few assumptions can be made about the randomness of the events.</p>
<p>The <strong>Poisson distribution</strong> describes the number of events that occur in a fixed period of time.</p>
<p>The <strong>exponential distribution</strong> describes the time until the first event in the process, and also the time between successive events.</p>
<p>The time until the k'th event in the process has an <strong>Erlang distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>With related assumptions, the lifetime (or survival time) of an item also has an exponential distribution.</p>
