<p>Random variables are sometimes defined as functions of others. For example, parameter estimates are usually functions of the values in a random sample.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will describe some general methods for finding the distribution of  a random variable  that is defined as a function of a <strong>single</strong>  variable, <em>Y </em>=<em> g</em>(<em>X</em>).</p>
<p>We start with some general methods to find the distribution of a transformed random variable. One application of these methods shows how to generate random values from an arbitrary distribution from values that have been randomly generated with a Rectangular(0, 1) distribution.</p>
<p>Linear transformations are particularly important in statistics, and formulae are given for the mean and variance of a linear function of a variable. In some families of distributions, linear transformations result in distributions from the same family. In particular, a linear transformation of a normally distributed variable also has a normal distribution.</p>
<p>Finally, if the distribution of a nonlinear transformation of a variable is  complex, the delta method may provide approximate values for its mean and variance.</p>
