<page dir="en/fDistn" filePrefix="fDistn1" summaryDir="en/fDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_fDistn1" videoDir="en/fDistn" videoFilePrefix="v_fDistn1">The ratio of two independent chi-squared variables (divided by their degrees of freedom) has an F distribution. Its probability density function is shown.</page>
<page dir="en/fDistn" filePrefix="fDistn2" summaryDir="en/fDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_fDistn2" videoDir="en/fDistn" videoFilePrefix="v_fDistn2">Formulae are given for the F distribution's mean and variance. It is very skew unless both of its degrees of freedom are large.</page>
<page dir="en/fDistn" filePrefix="fDistn3" summaryDir="en/fDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_fDistn3" videoDir="en/fDistn" videoFilePrefix="v_fDistn3">The ratio of two sample variances from normal distributions has a distribution proportional to an F distribution. A confidence interval for the ratio of the normal variances can be found from it.</page>
<page dir="en/fDistn" filePrefix="fDistn4" summaryDir="en/fDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_fDistn4" videoDir="en/fDistn" videoFilePrefix="v_fDistn4">The square of a random variable with a t distribution has an F distribution.</page>
