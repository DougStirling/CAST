<page dir="en/continuousDistns" filePrefix="continuousDistns1" summaryDir="en/continuousDistns" summaryFilePrefix="s_continuousDistns1" videoDir="en/continuousDistns" videoFilePrefix="v_continuousDistns1">A continuous random variable's distribution is described by a type of histogram with infinitely narrow classes, called the variable's probability density function.</page>
<page dir="en/continuousDistns" filePrefix="continuousDistns2" summaryDir="en/continuousDistns" summaryFilePrefix="s_continuousDistns2" videoDir="en/continuousDistns" videoFilePrefix="v_continuousDistns2">The probability of a value within any range equals the probability density function's area above these values.</page>
<page dir="en/continuousDistns" filePrefix="continuousDistns3" summaryDir="en/continuousDistns" summaryFilePrefix="s_continuousDistns3" videoDir="en/continuousDistns" videoFilePrefix="v_continuousDistns3">The mean and variance of a continuous random variable are interpreted in a similar way to those of continuous variables, but are defined using integrals instead of summations.</page>


<page dir="en/continuousDistns" filePrefix="continuousDistns4" summaryDir="en/continuousDistns" summaryFilePrefix="s_continuousDistns4" videoDir="en/continuousDistns" videoFilePrefix="v_continuousDistns4">A particularly important type of continuous distribution is the family of normal distributions. These are symmetric distributions whose centre and spread are described by two parameters, μ and σ.</page>


<page dir="en/continuousDistns" filePrefix="continuousDistns5" summaryDir="en/continuousDistns" summaryFilePrefix="s_continuousDistns5" videoDir="en/continuousDistns" videoFilePrefix="v_continuousDistns5">A normal random variable has 90% probability of being within 1.645σ of μ, 95% probability of being within 1.96σ of μ, and 99% probability of being within 2.576σ of μ.</page>
