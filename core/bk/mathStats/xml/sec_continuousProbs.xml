This can be found by integrating the pdf.</page>
<page dir="en/continuousProbs" filePrefix="continuousProbs2" summaryDir="en/continuousProbs" summaryFilePrefix="s_continuousProbs2" videoDir="en/continuousProbs" videoFilePrefix="v_continuousProbs2">The simplest continuous distribution is a rectangular one in which each value between two constants is equally likely. Probabilities can be found by geometry or integration.</page>
