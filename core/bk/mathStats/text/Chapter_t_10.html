<h1>Chapter 10 &nbsp; Normal-based distributions</h1>
<h2>10.1 &nbsp; Chi-squared distribution</h2>
<h3>10.1.1 &nbsp; Chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom</h3>
<p>The square of a variable with a standard normal distribution has a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. It is a special case of a gamma distribution.</p>
<h3>10.1.2 &nbsp; Properties of Chi-squared (1 df)</h3>
<p>This chi-squared distribution is extremely skew. Its mean and variance are found from those of the gamma distribution.</p>
<h3>10.1.3 &nbsp; General chi-squared distribution</h3>
<p>The sum of n independent chi-squared variables (1 df) has a chi-squared (n df) distribution. It is also a special case of a gamma distribution.</p>
<h3>10.1.4 &nbsp; General chi-squared properties</h3>
<p>The general chi-squared distribution with n degrees of freedom is also skew but becomes closer to symmetric when n increases. Its mean and variance are also given.</p>
<h3>10.1.5 &nbsp; Sample variance</h3>
<p>The variance of a random sample from a normal distribution has a distribution that is proportional to a chi-squared distribution.</p>
<h3>10.1.6 &nbsp; Confidence interval for normal variance</h3>
<p>A pivot can be based on a normal sample's variance. A confidence interval for the underlying normal distribution's variance σ² can be found from it.</p>
<h3>10.1.7 &nbsp; Pooled variance from several samples</h3>
<p>The sample variances from several normal random samples can be combined. If the underlying normal variances are equal, this pooled variance has a chi-squared distribution, allowing a confidence interval for σ² to be found.</p>
<h2>10.2 &nbsp; T distribution</h2>
<h3>10.2.1 &nbsp; Definition of t distribution</h3>
<p>The ratio of a standard normal variable and the square root of an independent chi-squared variable (divided by its degrees of freedom) has a t distribution. Its pdf is given.</p>
<h3>10.2.2 &nbsp; Mean, variance and shape</h3>
<p>Formulae for the mean and variance of the t distribution are given. Its tails are longer than those of a standard normal distribution, but the two distributions' shapes are close when the degrees of freedom are large.</p>
<h3>10.2.3 &nbsp; Pivot for normal mean</h3>
<p>A function of the sample mean, sample variance and μ is shown to have a t distribution if the sample comes from a normal distribution. It is a pivot for μ.</p>
<h3>10.2.4 &nbsp; Confidence interval for normal mean</h3>
<p>The pivot on the previous page can be used to find a confidence interval for a normal distribution's mean, μ.</p>
<h3>10.2.5 &nbsp; Two samples from normal distributions</h3>
<p>The difference between two sample means from normal distributions is normally distributed. The "pooled" estimator of the common variance has a chi-squared distribution.</p>
<h3>10.2.6 &nbsp; Estimating difference between means</h3>
<p>A pivot can be found from the difference between the sample means and pooled estimate of the variance. This can be used to find a confidence interval for the difference between the means.</p>
<h2>10.3 &nbsp; F distribution</h2>
<h3>10.3.1 &nbsp; Ratio of chi-squared variables</h3>
<p>The ratio of two independent chi-squared variables (divided by their degrees of freedom) has an F distribution. Its probability density function is shown.</p>
<h3>10.3.2 &nbsp; Mean, variance and shape</h3>
<p>Formulae are given for the F distribution's mean and variance. It is very skew unless both of its degrees of freedom are large.</p>
<h3>10.3.3 &nbsp; Comparing sample variances</h3>
<p>The ratio of two sample variances from normal distributions has a distribution proportional to an F distribution. A confidence interval for the ratio of the normal variances can be found from it.</p>
<h3>10.3.4 &nbsp; Relationship between t and F distributions</h3>
<p>The square of a random variable with a t distribution has an F distribution.</p>
