<h1>Chapter 8 &nbsp; Transformed Variables</h1>
<h2>8.1 &nbsp; General methods</h2>
<h3>8.1.1 &nbsp; Differentiating the CDF</h3>
<p>If a formula can be found for the cumulative distribution function, F(x), of a continuous random variable, its probability density function can be obtained as its derivative.</p>
<h3>8.1.2 &nbsp; Maximum of a rectangular distribution</h3>
<p>The maximum likelihood estimator of the upper limit of a rectangular distribution from a random sample is the maximum of the sample values. Its cumulative distribution function can be found and differentiated to get the estimator's pdf. Its bias and standard error are determined from this.</p>
<h3>8.1.3 &nbsp; Monotonic transformations</h3>
<p>The pdf of a monotonic function of X can be found directly from the pdf of X. The log-normal and Weibull distributions are given as examples.</p>
<h3>8.1.4 &nbsp; Relationship with rectangular distribution</h3>
<p>Any continuous distribution can be expressed in terms of a Rectangular(0, 1) distribution (and vice versa) using the CDF and its inverse as transformations.</p>
<h3>8.1.5 &nbsp; Generating random numbers</h3>
<p>Random values from any distribution can be obtained from randomly generated Rectangular(0, 1) values using the inverse of the CDF as a transformation.</p>
<h2>8.2 &nbsp; Linear transformations</h2>
<h3>8.2.1 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>The mean and variance of Y = a + bX can be simply expressed in terms of those of X.</p>
<h3>8.2.2 &nbsp; Distribution of transformed variable</h3>
<p>If X has a normal distribution, Y = a + bX is also normally distributed. In particular, Z = (X - μ) / σ has a standard normal distribution and this can be used to help find probabilities about X.</p>
<h3>8.2.3 &nbsp; Scale and location parameters</h3>
<p>In some families of distributions, linear transformations result in other distributions from the same family.</p>
<h3>8.2.4 &nbsp; Scale and location examples</h3>
<p>Examples are given in which scale and location parameters are identified.</p>
<h2>8.3 &nbsp; Delta method</h2>
<h3>8.3.1 &nbsp; Variance of transformed variable</h3>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to find the pdf of a transformed variable. This page gives an approximation to the transformed variable's mean and variance called the delta method. When applied to parameter estimates, the accuracy of the approximation improves as the sample size increases.</p>
<h3>8.3.2 &nbsp; Examples</h3>
<p>The delta method is used to find the approximate variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of the Geometric distribution's parameter. It is also used to get an approximate standard error for the odds of success in a binomial experiment.</p>
