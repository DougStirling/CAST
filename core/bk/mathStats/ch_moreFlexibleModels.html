<p>The distributions described in earlier chapters are based on certain assumptions about the processes underlying the variables. This chapter describes a few models that are flexible enough to be used in some situations where these assumptions do not hold.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the assumptions behind Poisson and binomial distributions do not hold, <strong>negative binomial</strong> and <strong>beta-binomial distributions</strong> have more flexible shapes.<br>
		&nbsp;
	</li>
	<li>A <strong>Weibull distribution</strong> allows the hazard rate for a lifetime distribution to vary with age.<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Gamma distributions</strong> are often used as flexible models for variables whose values can be any positive value. In a similar way, <strong>Beta distributions</strong> are flexible models for variables whose values must lie between 0 and 1.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Finally, <strong>normal distributions</strong> are symmetric distributions whose centre and spread can be adjusted to model many types of variable.</li>
</ul>
