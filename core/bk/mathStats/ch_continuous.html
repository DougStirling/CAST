<p>Probabilities for a continuous random variable are described by areas under a probability density function (pdf), and this corresponds to an integral of the pdf. The rectangular distribution is introduced as a simple example.</p>
<p>The mean and variance of a continuous random variable, and the expected value of other functions can also be expressed as integrals.</p>
<p>Most commonly used continuous distributions also  involve unknown parameters. The method of moments,  maximum likelihood and confidence intervals can be used to estimate these parameter in a similar way to  their use for discrete distributions.</p>
