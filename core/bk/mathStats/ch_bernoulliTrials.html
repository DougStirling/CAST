<p>The simplest kind of random situation is one in which there are only two possible outcomes that can be given the names 'success' and 'failure'. This is called a <strong>Bernoulli trial</strong>. </p>
<p>A few commonly encountered distributions arise from a series of independent Bernoulli trials. This chapter finds their probability functions and derives their means and variances.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bernoulli</strong> random variable is based on a single Bernoulli trial and is defined to be 1 if a success occurs and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>The <strong>binomial</strong> distribution is a generalisation of this and describes the number of successes in <em>n</em> such independent trials.</p>
<p>A <strong>geometric</strong> distribution describes the number of trials until the first success is observed. The <strong>negative binomial</strong> distribution generalises this and is the distribution of the number of trials until the <em>k</em>'th success.</p>
