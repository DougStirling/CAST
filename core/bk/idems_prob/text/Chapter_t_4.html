<h1>Chapter 4 &nbsp; Continuous Distributions</h1>
<h2>4.1 &nbsp; Finding probabilities</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 &nbsp; Probabilities by integration</h3>
<p>The probability of a value within any range is the area under the pdf above it. This can be found by integrating the pdf.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 &nbsp; Rectangular distribution</h3>
<p>The simplest continuous distribution is a rectangular one in which each value between two constants is equally likely. Probabilities can be found by geometry or integration.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 &nbsp; Other examples</h3>
<p>Finding probabilities by integration is illustrated with another two examples.</p>
<h3>4.1.4 &nbsp; Cumulative distribution function</h3>
<p>The cumulative distribution function, F(x), is the probability of value less than or equal to x.</p>
<h3>4.1.5 &nbsp; Quantiles</h3>
<p>The p'th quantile of a distribution is the value x such that the probability of a value less than x is p.</p>
<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Expected values</h3>
<p>The expected value of any function of a continuous random variable is defined by an integral.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>The expected value of X is called its mean. The variable's variance is the expected value of the squared difference between X and its mean.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; Example</h3>
<p>The mean and variance of a rectangular distribution are derived.</p>
<h2>4.3 &nbsp; Random samples</h2>
<h3>4.3.1 &nbsp; Independence and random samples</h3>
<p>Two continuous random variables are independent if knowing the value of one provides no information about the value of the other. A collection of n independent random variables with the same distribution is a random sample.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 &nbsp; Distribution of sample sum and mean</h3>
<p>Formulae are given for the mean and variance of the sum and mean of a random sample. The sum and mean are both approximately normal in large samples.</p>
<h2>4.4 &nbsp; Normal distribution</h2>
<h3>4.4.1 &nbsp; Standard normal distribution</h3>
<p>The normal distribution's pdf is given and the standard normal distribution is defined.</p>
<h3>4.4.2 &nbsp; Mean and variance</h3>
<p>The mean and variance of the standard normal distribution are derived and used to find the mean and variance of other normal distributions.</p>
<h3>4.4.3 &nbsp; Z-scores</h3>
<p>All normal distributions have the same shape when expressed in terms of standard deviations from the mean; these are called z-scores and have standard normal distributions.</p>
<h3>4.4.4 &nbsp; Probabilities for normal distributions</h3>
<p>Excel can be used to find probabilities about normal distributions. Translating questions into ones about z-scores gives a method to find probabilities using tables of probabilities for the standard normal distribution.</p>
<h3>4.4.5 &nbsp; Normal quantiles</h3>
<p>We usually want to find a cumulative probability corresponding to a given x-value. Occasionally the x-value corresponding to a given cumulative probability is needed â€” a quantile of the distribution.</p>
