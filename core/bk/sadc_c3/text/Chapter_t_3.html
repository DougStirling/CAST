<h1>Chapter 3 &nbsp; Distributions</h1>
<h2>3.1 &nbsp; Distribution of sample mean</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 &nbsp; Parameters and statistics</h3>
<p>A summary value describing a population is called a parameter and the corresponding value in a sample is called a statistic. Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 &nbsp; Variability of sample mean</h3>
<p>A sample mean has a distribution that is centred round the population mean but has smaller spread than the population.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 &nbsp; Standard devn of sample mean</h3>
<p>The spread of the sample mean decreases as sample size increases. A formula is given for the standard deviation of the sample mean in terms of the sample size and population standard deviation.</p>
<h3>3.1.4 &nbsp; Means from normal populations</h3>
<p>Sample means from normal populations also have normal distributions.</p>
<h3>3.1.5 &nbsp; Large-sample normality of means</h3>
<p>The shape of the sample mean's distribution is usually close to normal, even if the population distribution is skew or multimodal. The bigger the sample size, the closer the distribution to normal.</p>
<h3>3.1.6 &nbsp; Distribution of mean from a sample</h3>
<p>It is possible to estimate the distribution of a sample mean from a single sample.</p>
<h3>3.1.7 &nbsp; Requirement of independence</h3>
<p>If the sample values are positively correlated, the standard deviation of the mean will be underestimated.</p>
<h3>3.1.8 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations</h3>
<p>If a random sample is selected without replacement, the formula for the standard deviation of the sample mean must be modified.</p>
<h2>3.2 &nbsp; Distribution of sample proportion</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 &nbsp; Proportion and probability</h3>
<p>The population proportion in a category is called its probability. Proportions and probabilities can be obtained from categorical and numerical variables.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 &nbsp; Properties of counts and proportions</h3>
<p>The sample proportion is a statistic that varies from sample to sample. The sample count in a category is also random with a discrete distribution.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 &nbsp; Binomial distribution</h3>
<p>The sample count in a category has a standard distribution called a binomial distribution with parameters n and Ï€.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 &nbsp; Binomial probability examples</h3>
<p>The binomial distribution can be used to find probabilities relating to sample counts.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 &nbsp; Normal approximation to binomial</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, the distribution of the sample count in a category becomes close to a normal distribution.</p>
<h3>3.2.6 &nbsp; Normal approximation examples</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find binomial probabilities.</p>
