<h1>Chapter 10 &nbsp; Sampling and Variability</h1>
<h2>10.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h2>
<h3>10.1.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h3>
<p>A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</p>
<h3>10.1.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h3>
<p>A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</p>
<h3>10.1.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h3>
<p>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</p>
<h3>10.1.4 &nbsp; Sampling error and sample size</h3>
<p>As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </p>
<h3>10.1.5 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations</h3>
<p>Sampling with replacement from a finite population permits the same value to be selected two or more times. Sampling without replacement ensures that there are no such duplicates.</p>
<h3>10.1.6 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h3>
<p>Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</p>
<h2>10.2 &nbsp; Sampling schemes</h2>
<h3>10.2.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h3>
<p>More accurate estimates can sometimes be obtained by taking separate random samples within different parts of the population.</p>
<h3>10.2.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h3>
<p>When individuals are grouped in clusters, it is often cheaper to sample complete clusters rather than separate individuals.</p>
<h3>10.2.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling</h3>
<p>When the target population is spread over a wide area, it may be cheaper to take a sample of regions (groups of individuals), than to sample from all the regions.</p>
