<p>In paired data, two related measurements, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, are made
from each sampled individual and we are interested in testing whether their means
are equal.</p>
<p class="heading">Groups of 3 or more values</p>
<p>The idea of paired data can be extended to situations in which 3 or more related
measurements are made from each 'individual'. Two important situations that give
rise to this type of data are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Experiment with blocks</dt>
<dd>Paired data can arise when the experimental units are grouped into blocks of
size 2 (e.g. matched pairs) and two treatments are used. This can be extended to <em>g</em> treatments
with blocks of <em>g</em> experimental units and the treatments randomised within
each block.</dd>
<dt>Repeated measure data</dt>
<dd>Several comparable measurements may be made from each individual, often measurements
of the same quantity at different times.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">Example (randomised blocks) </p>
<p>In an experiment to assess the effect of  codeine and acupuncture
for relieving dental pain, 32 subjects  were grouped into
blocks of 4 according to an initial assessment of their tolerance to pain. Four treatments
were randomly given to the four subjects in each block and pain relief scores were
recorded.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">7.1.2 &nbsp; Example with baseline treatment</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>We start with a simple example in which  one of the <em>g</em> treatments is a
standard or 'baseline' treatment. The other (<em>g</em> &minus; 1)
treatments can be compared to it using standard confidence intervals for paired data.
These confidence intervals are usually narrower than the corresponding confidence
intervals that would be found for independent samples.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>In a randomised experiment about pain relief treatments in dental patients, 32
subjects were grouped into blocks of four according to an initial assessment of their
tolerance to pain. One treatment was a placebo (dummy treatment) that the others
could be compared to.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_indepCIs.gif" width="453" height="474"></p>
<p>If the initial grouping of paitents into blocks is ignored, 95% confidence intervals
for the improvement in pain relief over the placebo are wide. Taking account of the
initial grouping, differences are far more accurately estimated.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_pairedCIs.gif" width="453" height="474"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.1.3 &nbsp; Use of blocking information</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Testing for equal treatment means</p>
<p>If  there is no baseline treatment, analysis should start with a single hypothesis
test for whether all treatment means are equal. The standard multi-group analysis
of variance test for equal means in a completely randomised experiment (ignoring
the blocks) should <strong>not</strong> be used for experiments with
blocks.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>Ignoring the existence of blocks makes it much harder to detect differences
between treatments.</p></div></div>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>Five different observers each watched the same group of 10 cattle and reported
how long each animal spent grazing.</p>
<p style="color:#F00; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0px">Wrong analysis</p>
<p style="margin-top:5px">Ignoring the fact that the same animals were observed by all five observers, the
data would be analysed with the anova table below. From the large p-value, we would
conclude that there were no differences between the observers.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_indepPvalue.gif" width="482" height="433"></p>
<p style="color:#F00; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0px">Correct analysis</p>
<p style="margin-top:5px">Much of the variability in the data is due to differences
between the animals (blocks),
and an analysis that ignores this is much less sensitive to differences between the
observers. We will not explain the correct test for blocked data until later in this
section, but it gives a p-value that is interpreted in the same way as the p-value
above. It is shown below and
shows that there are almost certainly differences between the observers.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_blockedPvalue.gif" width="482" height="380"></p>



<h2 class="pageName">7.1.4 &nbsp; Randomised block designs</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>In paired data, each of the two treatments is used once within each block (pair).
The previous
pages generalised this to more than two treatments, but each treatment was still
used once in each block. We now generalise further to allow the
block
size to be any multiple of the number of treatments.</p>
<p class="heading">Reducing unexplained variability</p>
<p>To assess the significance of differences between experimental treatments, variation
in the treatment means is compared to the amount of unexplained (random) variation.
With less unexplained variation, there is less chance of the differences between
treatment means having arisen by chance. There are two ways to reduce unexplained
variation:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Use experimental units that are as similar as possible.</dt>
<dd>Identical experimental units cannot usually be found but similar experimental
units give best accuracy.</dd>
<dt>Group the experimental units into blocks of similar units.</dt>
<dd>If the experimental units vary but can be grouped into blocks of similar units,
then these blocks 'explain' some of the variability, and unexplained variability
is reduced.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The simplest way to use blocks in an experiment is with a <strong>randomised block
design</strong>. In this, the block size is a multiple of the number of treatments.
Each treatment is used for the same number of experimental units within each block,
and the treatments are randomly allocated to units within the blocks.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted in which the experimental units were intestinal preparations
from fish, but each fish would only give six preparations. The six preparations from
each fish constitute a block of units. Two treatments were used, with  the six preparations
from each of four fish randomly split into three preparations for each treatment
(a randomised block experiment).</p>
<p style="color:#F00; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0px">Wrong
analysis</p>
<p style="margin-top:5px">Ignoring possible differences between the four fish and
treating the data as a completely randomised experiment with 24 experimental units,
we would conclude that there is moderately strong evidence of a difference between
the two treatments.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_indepPvalue2.gif" width="466" height="300"></p>
<p style="color:#F00; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0px">Correct
analysis</p>
<p style="margin-top:5px">There are considerable differences between the four fish
(blocks), with much lower variability within any single fish. The correct analysis
is explained later in this section and the resulting p-value gives much stronger
evidence of a difference between the two treatments.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_blockedPvalue2.gif" width="466" height="300"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.1.5 &nbsp; Model for randomised blocks</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Three-dimensional scatterplot of data</p>
<p>Data from a randomised block experiment can be displayed in a three-dimensional
scatterplot:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_threeD.gif" width="392" height="369"></p>
<p class="heading">Model</p>
<p>Both blocks and treatments explain some variability in the response measurement,
<em>Y</em>, but...</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocks are a grouping of the experimental units whereas treatments are allocated
by the researcher.</li>
<li>We are mainly interested in comparing the treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blocks and treatments are modelled
in the same way:</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><em>y</em> = (overall
mean) + (effect depending on block)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + (effect depending on treatment)
+ error</p>
</div></div>

<p>The error is again assumed to have a normal distribution with mean zero and constant
standard deviation. Within any block, changing the treatment simply adds or subtracts
a constant to the response.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.1.6 &nbsp; Removing block effects</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Making all block means equal</p>
<p>Our model for randomised block data explains the effect of the blocks on <em>Y</em> as
a  addition  of a &quot;block effect&quot; to all values within each block. This
suggests eliminating differences between the blocks by adjusting the values in all
blocks to have the same block means.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>The diagram below shows results from an experiment with blocks of size five and
five treatments. Different colours are used for the different blocks and the block
means are shown with vertical lines.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_blockMeans.gif" width="482" height="217"></p>
<p>A lot of the variability in the response, <em>Y</em>, is caused by differences
between the blocks. The diagram below adjusts the values by adding a constant to
all values in each block, givving all blocks the same mean response.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_blockSameMeans.gif" width="482" height="217"></p>
<p>Since there is now much less 'unexplained' variation and there are now no differences
between blocks, applying the standard anova test for equal treatment means to the
adjusted data seems reasonable and is much more sensitive to treatment differences:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/randBlock/images/s_adjustedAnova.gif" width="387" height="87"></p>
<p>The treatment and residual sums of squares shown here are the <strong>basis</strong> for
testing whether the treatment means are  equal, but the analysis is not completely
correct.</p>
<div class="centred"><table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFF00" class="centred">
<tr>
<td align="center" class="darkred bold">The  residual degrees of freedom
are too high.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>The correct analysis of variance table for testing equal treatment
means is a little more complex for randomised block data; it will be explained in
the following pages.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">7.1.7 &nbsp; Sums of squares</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Notation</p>
<p>For randomised block data, we use the following notation:</p>

<p class="heading">Sums of squares</p>
<p>For randomised block data, we again split the total sum of squares into components,
but now need to use <strong>three </strong>components.</p>

<p class="heading">Residuals and residual variation</p>
<p>As in regression, we define residuals to be the difference between the recorded
response values and the closest we can get from our model. For a randomised block
model, the best estimate is:</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><span style="position:relative; top:4px"><img src="../../../en/../images/symbol.yiHat.png" width="11" height="18" align="baseline"></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>b</em><sub>1 </sub><em>x<sub>i</sub></em></span></p>
<p>This can be interpreted as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the block mean, with an adjustment for how far the treatment mean is different
from the overall mean, or</li>
<li>the treatment mean, with an adjustment for how far the observation's block mean
is different from the overall mean.</li>
</ul>




<h2 class="pageName">7.1.8 &nbsp; Anova table and examples</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Anova table</p>
<p>The three components that add to total sum of squares 
are usually laid out in an <strong>analysis of variance</strong> table
(or simply <strong>anova</strong> table).</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/randBlock/images/randBlockAnovaTable.gif" id="gif_image_1_8_1" width="592" height="186"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/randBlock/images/randBlockAnovaTable.svg" id="svg_image_1_8_1" width="592" height="186" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_1_8_1");</script> </p>
<p>The anova table adds a few extra columns:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Degrees of freedom</dt>
<dd>They also add up to the value in the <em>Total</em> row, (<em>n</em> &minus; 1).</dd>
<dt>Mean sums of squares</dt>
<dd>These are the sums of squares divided by their degrees of freedom.</dd>
<dt>F-ratios</dt>
<dd>For the blocks and treatments, the F-ratio divides the mean sum of squares by
the mean residual sum of squares.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">Tests</p>
<p>The F-ratio for differences between the treatments compares the variability explained
by the treatments to the residual (unexplained) variation. The larger the F-ratio,
the stronger the evidence for a difference between treatments. A formal hypothesis
test is based on the F-ratio and its p-value is the probability of getting as big
an F-ratio as that recorded if all treatment means were equal. It is interpreted
in the same way as all other p-values.</p>
<dl>
<dt>p-value &gt; 0.1</dt>
<dd>No evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
<dt>0.1 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.05</dt>

</dl>
<p>A p-value can also be found to test whether there are differences between the
