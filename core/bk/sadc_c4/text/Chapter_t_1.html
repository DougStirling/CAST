<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; Distributions</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Importance of normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are sometimes useful as models for data, but the main reason for their importance is that sample means and many other summary statistics have approximately normal distributions.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; Shape of normal distributions</h3>
<p>All normal distributions look the same on a scale of standard deviations from the mean.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; Sketching a normal distribution</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are centred on their mean, µ, and have hardly any area beyond 3σ  on each side. A small area (about 5%) is over 2 standard deviations away from the mean.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 &nbsp; Some normal probabilities</h3>
<p>The probabilities of being within (σ, 2σ, and 3σ) of the mean are (0.68, 0.95 and 0.997) for all normal distributions. This is a close match to the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb for numerical data sets.</p>
<h3>1.1.5 &nbsp; Z-scores</h3>
<p>Any value, x, can be translated into a z-score that gives the number of standard deviations above the mean.</p>
<h3>1.1.6 &nbsp; Finding normal probabilities</h3>
<p>Z-scores have a standard normal distribution (µ = 0 and σ = 1). The probability of a value less than x can be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>1.1.7 &nbsp; Other probabilities</h3>
<p>The probability that X is greater than a specified value or is between two values can also be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>1.1.8 &nbsp; Normal tables</h3>
<p>If a computer is not available, tables of probabilities for the standard normal distribution are used to find normal probabilities.</p>
<h3>1.1.9 &nbsp; Finding normal quantiles</h3>
<p>The inverse problem of finding the x-value corresponding to a given probability is also solved using z-scores. If normal tables are used, they must be looked up differently.</p>
<h3>1.1.10 &nbsp; Normal probability plots</h3>
<p>A normal probability plot is an informal graphical method to help assess whether a data set comes from a normal distribution. Curvature in the probability plot suggests that the data may not be normal.</p>
