  <p>CAST contains several alternative e-books that cover the material in  introductory statistics courses. This e-book is the 'general' one â€” it uses data sets and scenarios of general interest, whereas other 
    e-books use examples from specific subject areas.</p>
  <p>Since similar statistical methods are used in most application areas, the 
    statistical concepts covered by the different e-books are mostly the same. 
    You can therefore study any CAST e-book to learn these concepts. However 
    you may find it more interesting to read applications that are related to 
    your professional interests if a more relevant CAST e-book has been written.</p>


<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideoButton('Show introductory video');</script>

<p>After looking at the introductory video, you can move directly to Chapter 1 where you will learn about the importance of using data when making decisions, typical data structures and the need to use statistics to get useful information from data.</p>
