<h1 class="sectionName">4.1 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">4.1.1 &nbsp; More than one variable</h2>

<p class="heading">The data matrix</p>
	<p>Many datasets contain several measurements from each <strong>individual</strong> (or plant, item
		or other unit). Each measurement type is called a <strong>variable</strong>. </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/structures/images/dataMatrix.gif" width="258" height="283"> </p>
	<p>A data set with more than one variable is called <strong>multivariate</strong>.
One with two
variables is called <strong>bivariate</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.1.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Scatterplots</p>
	<p>A scatterplot shows each individual as a single cross against a vertical axis
		(for the variable, <i>Y</i>) and a horizontal axis (for the other variable, <i>X</i>). </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/scatterValues.gif" width="279" height="189"> </p>
	<p>By convention,  the variable on the vertical axis is called <i>Y</i> and
		the variable on the horizontal axis is called <i>X</i>. </p>





<h2 class="pageName">4.1.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Scatterplots are needed to display  relationships</p>
	<p>The relationship between two variables cannot be determined from examination
 of the two variables in isolation. The two datasets shown in the scatterplots
below have the <strong>same marginal distributions</strong> for X and Y, but the variables are related
in very different ways.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/s_sameMargins.gif" width="509" height="211"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">4.1.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Marginal distributions</p>
<p><span class="full_text">Although 
		they do not contain information about the relationship between the variables, 
	a display of the marginal distributions can be usefully <strong>added</strong> to a scatterplot to enhance it, perhaps highlighting skewness in X and Y.</span></p>

<h2 class="pageName">4.1.5 &nbsp; Time series</h2>

<p class="heading">Time-ordering of univariate data</p>
	<p>Some data sets are apparently univariate, but the measurements are made sequentially 
		in time.  A data set of this form is called a <strong>time series</strong>.</p>
	<p>The time at which each measurement was made may be treated as an additional 
		numerical variable, and the measurement can then be plotted against time. 
		This type of scatterplot is often called a <strong>time series plot</strong>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/s_timeSeries.gif" width="504" height="300"></p>





<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">4.2 &nbsp; Association &amp; causal relationships</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">4.2.1 &nbsp; Interest in relationships</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>We are often interested in relationships between variables. The correlation between two numerical variables summarises their relationship; a contingency table  contains information about the relationship between two categorical variables.</p>
<p>When the individuals can be split into groups, a categorical variable can
be used to define group membership. Differences between the groups can then be
expressed as a relationship between the grouping variable and other variables.
The following questions are essentially asking the same in two different ways:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Do boys and girls aged 14 perform the same at maths?</dt>
	<dt>Is there a relationship between gender and mark in a maths test?</dt>
</dl>
<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
	evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>
	

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Relationships can be much harder to interpret than you might think</p>
</div></div>





<h2 class="pageName">4.2.2 &nbsp; Causal and non-causal relationships</h2>

<p>When two variables are related, we say that there is <strong>association</strong> between them.</p>
	<p class="heading">Causal relationships</p>
	<p>A <strong>causal relationship</strong> arises when we can conclude that one variable has a <strong>direct
influence</strong> on the other.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln1.gif" width="297" height="65"></p>
	<p class="heading">Non-causal relationships</p>
	<p>In non-causal relationships, the association between the two variables is not completely the result of 
		one variable directly affecting the other.</p>
	<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln2.gif" width="297" height="154"></td>
			<td><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln3.gif" width="297" height="120"></td>
			</tr>
	</table></div>
	<p>If two variables are <strong>not</strong> causally related, it is impossible 
		to tell whether changes to one variable, <em>X</em>, will result in changes to 
		the other variable, <em>Y</em>.</p>
	<p>The scatterplot below shows data from a sample of towns in a region. Neither variable directly affects the other. (The size of the towns is a lurking variable since larger towns have more churches and also more deaths.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/cancerChurch.gif" width="325" height="272"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.2.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Is a relationship causal?</p>
	<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
		the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
		adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change.</p>
	<p>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
	collected. <strong>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</strong></p>
	<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
	<p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables called <strong>lurking variables</strong> that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
  it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.2.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Individuals / units</p>
	<p>Most data sets consist of one or more values that are recorded from each of 
		a set of <strong>individuals</strong> (or plants, plots of land, repetitions of an experiment or 
		other 'units'). There are two different ways in which data can be collected from these units.</p>
<p class="heading">Types of data collection</p>
	<p>In an <strong>observational study</strong>, we passively 
		record (observe) values from each unit. Usually these units are sampled from some population.</p>
	<p>In an <strong>experiment</strong>, the researcher actively changes some characteristics 
		of the units before the data are collected. The values of some variables are therefore <strong>under the control of the experimenter</strong>. In other words, the experimenter 
		is able to <strong>choose</strong> each individual's values for some variables.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.2.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Observational studies and experiments</p>
	<p>The method of data collection has a major influence on whether a relationship 
		can be interpreted as causal.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Observational study</dt>
		<dd>There is usually the potential for a lurking 
				variable to underlie any observed relationship, so it is difficult to interpret 
		relationships.</dd>
		<dt>Experiment</dt>
		<dd>Provided the experiment has been designed well, there is little chance of lurking variables 
		driving the observed relationships, so any relationship will be causal.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>In a <strong>badly</strong> designed experiment however, lurking variables 
		can still cause difficulties in interpreting relationships.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">4.3 &nbsp; Understanding relationships</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">4.3.1 &nbsp; Strength of a relationship</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Strength of relationship</p>
<p>The most important information that a scatterplot shows is the <strong>strength</strong> of the relationship between the variables. The closer the points to a straight line or curve, the stronger the relationship.</p>
<p>If higher values of one variable tend to be associated with higher values
 of the other variable, the crosses on the scatterplot will be in a band with
positive slope and the relationship is said to be <strong>positive</strong>. If high values of one variable tend to be associated with low values of the 
	other variable, we say that there is a <strong>negative</strong> relationship.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/relationship/images/s_types.gif" width="398" height="323"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">4.3.2 &nbsp; Outliers</h2>

<p>The strength of the relationship between two variables is usually the most 
  important information that we gain from a scatterplot but a scatterplot may display other features.</p>
<p class="heading">Outliers</p>
<p>Values that seem 'different' from the rest of the data are called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
<p>An outlier may be an extreme value of one or other variable, but an individual
may be an outlier even though neither X nor Y is unusual on its own. One point
is an outlier in each of the three data sets below.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers.gif" width="312" height="157">       <img class="gif" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers2.gif" width="142" height="158"></p>
<p>The point is an
outlier in the righthand data set  because it lies well above the main group
of points &mdash; its y-value is much higher than others with similar x-values.</p>
<p class=heading>Importance of outliers</p>
<p>Outliers are features of a data set that <strong>must</strong> be carefully 
	checked. An outlier is often caused by a recording or transcription error, 
	so...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>First check that the values of the variables 
			are correctly recorded.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes an outlier arises because an individual is fundamentally different 
	from the others.  Identifying what makes the individual different  often gives considerable insight into the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The individuals should be further examined (perhaps 
			collecting further information from them) to try to assess whether the 
			outlier individual has distinct characteristics.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An outlier that is either extreme or that has other distinctive characteristics 
	would often be deleted from the data set, but should be mentioned in a report 
	about the data.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.3.3 &nbsp; Clusters</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>Sometimes the cloud of crosses separates into two or more groups which are 
		called <strong>clusters</strong>. As with outliers, clusters provide important 
		information that should be further investigated.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/relationship/images/s_clusters.gif" width="241" height="222"></p>
	<p>The individuals should be  examined (perhaps collecting further 
		information from them) to  assess whether the clusters correspond to
 individuals with distinct characteristics. For example, the clusters may correspond
 to males and females, or  two different species of plant.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.3.4 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h2>

<p class="heading">Interpreting outliers or clusters</p>
	<p>We have described some information that may be read from a scatterplot. But
		how strong must the corrresponding patterns be before we should report them? </p>
	<p>In both univariate and bivariate data sets, outliers or clusters must be <strong> distinct</strong> before we should conclude that they are real,
		in the absence of further external information confirming that the
		individuals are distinct. </p>
<p>Particularly in small data sets, outliers, clusters and other patterns may arise <strong>by chance</strong>, without being associated with any real features in the
		individuals. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Be careful not to overinterpret features in scatterplot unless they 
				are well defined, especially if the sample size is small.</p>
</div></div>

	



<h2 class="pageName">4.3.5 &nbsp; Explanatory and response variables</h2>

<p class=heading>Causal relationships</p>
	<p>In many bivariate data sets, the relationship between the two variables is 
		not symmetric. From the nature of the variables and the way that the data were collected, it may be clear that one variable, X, can potentially influence the other, Y, but that the opposite is impossible.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln1.gif" width="297" height="65"></p>
<p>In such data, the variable X is called the <strong>explanatory variable</strong> and Y is called the <strong>response</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading>Experiments</p>
	<p>In an experiment,  the person conducting the experiment controls the values
of the explanatory variable. A well-designed experiment
always ensures that the relationship between the explanatory variable and response
is causal.</p>
<p class=heading>Observational studies</p>
	<p>If the person collecting the data has no control over either of the variables,
and simply records a pair of values from each individual, then the data are called <strong>observational</strong>.
If one variable is an earlier measurement than the other, we may also
be able to treat it as an explanatory variable and the later variable as the
response. </p>
<p>Even if the relationship is not causal, we are sometimes interested in <strong>predicting</strong> the
value of one variable from the other. The variable being predicted would then
be treated as the response.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">4.4 &nbsp; Correlation</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">4.4.1 &nbsp; Units for X and Y</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Units and strength of a relationship</p>
	<p>A numerical summary of the strength of the relationship between two variables
should not depend on the units in which we measure the two variables. The strength
of the two relationships between Angle and Temperature are the same in both of
the scatterplots below.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/correlation/images/s_units.gif" width="550" height="219"></p>
	<p>We therefore start by defining <strong>units-free</strong> versions of the two variables and will summarise the strength of the relationship in terms of them.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.4.2 &nbsp; Units-free variables (z-scores)</h2>

<p class="heading">Z-scores</p>
	<p>The <strong>standardised</strong> form of a variable X is found by subtracting its mean then dividing by its standard deviation,</p>
	<div class="centred">
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" class="centred">

				<th style="margin:0px; padding:0px" valign="middle"><span class="bold">standardised value,</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>

			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	<p>The resulting values are  called <strong>z-scores</strong> and are the same,
whatever the units in which X was originally recorded.</p>
<p class="heading">Properties of z-scores</p>
	<p>A standardised variable always has zero mean and standard deviation one. </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/correlation/images/standardMeanSD.gif" width="110" height="18"> </p>
	<p>From the  <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('centerSpread6')">70-95-100

	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">

			<li>About 70% of z-scores will be between -1 and +1</li>
			<li>About 95% of z-scores will be between -2 and +2</li>
			<li>Almost all z-scores will be between -3 and +3</li>
		</ul>
	</div></div>
	<p>An individual's z-score tells you how many standard deviations it is above the mean. From its value, you can tell whether the value is very high (say over +2) or low (say under -2) in relation to the other values  of the variable.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.4.3 &nbsp; Correlation coefficient</h2>

<p class="heading">Definition</p>
<p>The <strong>correlation coefficient</strong> is usually defined by the formula </p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/correlation/images/corrDefn2.gif" width="213" height="67"></p>
<p>It is however easier to understand if written in terms of standardised versions

	<p>The correlation coefficient, <i>r</i>, is a good description of the strength

<h2 class="pageName">4.5.4 &nbsp; Least squares</h2>

<p class="heading">Aim of small residuals</p>
	<p>The residuals from a linear model (vertical distances from the crosses 
		to the line) indicate how closely the model's predictions  match the actual responses in the data. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/leastSqrs/images/s_allResids.gif" width="354" height="310"> </p>
	<p>'Good' values for <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> can be
objectively chosen to be the values that minimise the residual sum of squares.
This is the <strong>method
of least squares</strong> and the values of <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> are
called  <strong>least squares 
		estimates</strong>.</p>
<p>The diagram below respresents the squared residuals as blue squares. The least squares estimates minimise the total blue area.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">4.5.5 &nbsp; Curvature and outliers</h2>

<p class="heading">Nonlinear relationships</p>
	<p>A simple linear model is only appropriate when the cloud of crosses 
	in a scatterplot of the data is regularly spread around a straight line. If the crosses are scattered round a <strong>curve</strong>, the relationship is called <strong>nonlinear</strong> and
other models must be used.</p>
<p class="heading">Outliers</p>
<p>Another problem arises if there are <strong>outliers</strong> &mdash; observations that do not conform to the 
		pattern and variability exhibited by the rest of the data. In a linear model, 
		the most important type of outlier is a data point that lies at a distance 
		from the line that would fit through the rest of the data. </p>
	<p>The individual corresponding to any outlier should be carefully examined. Recording
		or transcription errors may be the cause. Alternatively, it may be possible to determine some
		distinguishing characteristic of the individual that underlies the unusual response
		measurement. </p>
	<p>If an outlier is extreme enough, or if a special cause for its unusual behaviour can be
		found from outside information, the individual can be classified as aberrant
		and deleted from the data set.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>It is important to <strong>look at any data set graphically</strong> before
fitting a linear model to check that no curvature or outliers is present.</p>
	</div></div>
	



<h2 class="pageName">4.5.6 &nbsp; Residual plots</h2>

<p class="heading">Detecting problems with the model</p>
	<p>If outliers or curvature are present in a data set, they are often visible 
		in a scatterplot of the response against the explanatory variable. However 
		these features are usually clearer if the <strong>residuals</strong> are plotted 
		against <i>X</i> rather than the original response.</p>
