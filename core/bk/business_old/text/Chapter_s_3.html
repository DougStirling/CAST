<h2 class="pageName">3.1.1 &nbsp; Bivariate data sets</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">The data matrix</p>
	<p>Many datasets contain several measurements from each <strong>individual</strong> (or plant, item
		or other unit). Each measurement type is called a <strong>variable</strong>. </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/structures/images/dataMatrix.gif" width="258" height="283"> </p>
	<p>A data set with more than one variable is called <strong>multivariate</strong>.
One with two
variables is called <strong>bivariate</strong>.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.1.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Scatterplots</p>
	<p>A scatterplot shows each individual as a single cross against a vertical axis
		(for the variable, <i>Y</i>) and a horizontal axis (for the other variable, <i>X</i>). </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/scatterValues.gif" width="279" height="189"> </p>
	<p>By convention,  the variable on the vertical axis is called <i>Y</i> and
		the variable on the horizontal axis is called <i>X</i>. </p>





<h2 class="pageName">3.1.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Scatterplots are needed to display  relationships</p>
	<p>The relationship between two variables cannot be determined from examination
 of the two variables in isolation. The two datasets shown in the scatterplots
below have the <strong>same marginal distributions</strong> for X and Y, but the variables are related
in very different ways.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/scatterplot/images/s_sameMargins.gif" width="509" height="211">       <img class="gif" src="../../../en/relationship/images/outliers2.gif" width="142" height="158"></p>
<p>The point is an
outlier in the righthand data set  because it lies well above the main group
of points &mdash; its y-value is much higher than others with similar x-values.</p>
<p class=heading>Importance of outliers</p>
<p>Outliers are features of a data set that <strong>must</strong> be carefully 
	checked. An outlier is often caused by a recording or transcription error, 
	so...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>First check that the values of the variables 
			are correctly recorded.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes an outlier arises because an individual is fundamentally different 
	from the others.  Identifying what makes the individual different  often gives considerable insight into the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The individuals should be further examined (perhaps 
			collecting further information from them) to try to assess whether the 
			outlier individual has distinct characteristics.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An outlier that is either extreme or that has other distinctive characteristics 
	would often be deleted from the data set, but should be mentioned in a report 
	about the data.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.2.3 &nbsp; Clusters</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>Sometimes the cloud of crosses separates into two or more groups which are 
		called <strong>clusters</strong>. As with outliers, clusters provide important 
		information that should be further investigated.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/relationship/images/s_clusters.gif" width="241" height="222"></p>
<p>In such data, the variable X is called the <strong>explanatory variable</strong> and Y is called the <strong>response</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading>Experiments</p>
	<p>In an experiment,  the person conducting the experiment controls the values
of the explanatory variable. A well-designed experiment
always ensures that the relationship between the explanatory variable and response
is causal.</p>
<p class=heading>Observational studies</p>
	<p>If the person collecting the data has no control over either of the variables,
and simply records a pair of values from each individual, then the data are called <strong>observational</strong>.
If one variable is an earlier measurement than the other, we may also
be able to treat it as an explanatory variable and the later variable as the
response. </p>
<p>Even if the relationship is not causal, we are sometimes interested in <strong>predicting</strong> the
value of one variable from the other. The variable being predicted would then
be treated as the response.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">3.3.1 &nbsp; Units for X and Y</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Units and strength of a relationship</p>
	<p>A numerical summary of the strength of the relationship between two variables
should not depend on the units in which we measure the two variables. The strength
of the two relationships between Sales (of ice cream) and Temperature are
the same in both of the scatterplots below.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/correlation/images/s_units_c.gif" width="550" height="219"></p>
	<p>The resulting values are  called <strong>z-scores</strong> and are the same,
whatever the units in which X was originally recorded.</p>
<p class="heading">Properties of z-scores</p>
	<p>A standardised variable always has zero mean and standard deviation one. </p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/correlation/images/standardMeanSD.gif" width="110" height="18"> </p>
	<p>From the  <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('centerSpread6')">70-95-100 
	rule-of-thumb</a>, </p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<ul>
			<li>About 70% of z-scores will be between -1 and +1</li>
			<li>About 95% of z-scores will be between -2 and +2</li>
			<li>Almost all z-scores will be between -3 and +3</li>
		</ul>
	</div></div>
	<p>An individual's z-score tells you how many standard deviations it is above the mean. From its value, you can tell whether the value is very high (say over +2) or low (say under -2) in relation to the other values  of the variable.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.3.3 &nbsp; Correlation coefficient</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Definition</p>
<p>The <strong>correlation coefficient</strong> is usually defined by the formula </p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/correlation/images/corrDefn2.gif" width="213" height="67"></p>
<p>It is however easier to understand if written in terms of standardised versions
of <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>,</p>
<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/correlation/images/corrDefn.gif" width="110" height="44"> </p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The correlation coefficient is a kind of <strong>average of the products</strong> of the z-scores.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">How does <i>r</i> relate to the shape of a scatterplot?</p>
<p>The following properties of <i>r</i> explain in general terms how its value 
	is related to the strength of a relationship in any particular scatterplot.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">3.3.4 &nbsp; Scatterplots and the value of r</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">How does <i>r</i> relate to the shape of a scatterplot?</p>
<p>The properties on the previous page describe the general behaviour of the correlation coefficient, 
	but do not give enough resolution for you to anticipate the type of scatterplot 
	that might have correlation coefficient 0.8 say, or 0.96.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/correlation/images/s_rValue.gif" width="550" height="452"> </p>
	<p>'Good' values for <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> can be
objectively chosen to be the values that minimise the residual sum of squares.
This is the <strong>method
of least squares</strong> and the values of <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> are
called  <strong>least squares 
		estimates</strong>.</p>
<p>The diagram below respresents the squared residuals as blue squares. The least squares estimates minimise the total blue area.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/leastSqrs/images/s_sqrResids.gif" width="359" height="316"> </p>




<h2 class="pageName">3.4.5 &nbsp; Curvature and outliers</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Nonlinear relationships</p>
	<p>A simple linear model is only appropriate when the cloud of crosses 
	in a scatterplot of the data is regularly spread around a straight line. If the crosses are scattered round a <strong>curve</strong>, the relationship is called <strong>nonlinear</strong> and
other models must be used.</p>
<p class="heading">Outliers</p>
<p>Another problem arises if there are <strong>outliers</strong> &mdash; observations that do not conform to the 
		pattern and variability exhibited by the rest of the data. In a linear model, 
		the most important type of outlier is a data point that lies at a distance 
		from the line that would fit through the rest of the data. </p>
	<p>The individual corresponding to any outlier should be carefully examined. Recording
		or transcription errors may be the cause. Alternatively, it may be possible to determine some
		distinguishing characteristic of the individual that underlies the unusual response
		measurement. </p>
	<p>If an outlier is extreme enough, or if a special cause for its unusual behaviour can be
		found from outside information, the individual can be classified as aberrant
		and deleted from the data set.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>It is important to <strong>look at any data set graphically</strong> before
fitting a linear model to check that no curvature or outliers is present.</p>
	</div></div>
	



<h2 class="pageName">3.4.6 &nbsp; Residual plots</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Detecting problems with the model</p>
	<p>If outliers or curvature are present in a data set, they are often visible 
		in a scatterplot of the response against the explanatory variable. However 
		these features are usually clearer if the <strong>residuals</strong> are plotted 
		against <i>X</i> rather than the original response.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/leastSqrs/images/s_residPlot.gif" width="557" height="264"></p>
	<p><strong>Different lines</strong> minimise the sum of squares of horizontal and vertical distances.</p>
	<p class="heading">About the two least squares lines</p>
	<p>The two least squares lines can be  written in terms of standardised 
		variables,</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" class="centred">
		<tr>
			<th>Equation of least squares line to predict Y from X</th>

		</tr>
	</table></div>
	<p>where <i>r</i> is the correlation coefficient between <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>. 
		Since <i>r</i> is always less than 1, the least squares line for predicting <i>Y</i> from <i>X</i> is the more horizontal (closer to being parallel to 
		the x-axis) of the two lines.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/leastSqrs/images/s_dualLines.gif" width="410" height="313"> </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/curvature/images/s_quadraticModel.gif" width="374" height="327">
	<p>A model may be useful for predicting <i>Y</i> from values of <i>X</i> that are within the range of x-values in our data, but we
		should be very cautious about using it to predict <em>Y</em> outside this range.
		This is called <strong>extrapolation</strong> and it can be badly in error. </p>
