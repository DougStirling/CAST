<h2 class="pageName">8.1.1 &nbsp; Interest in relationships</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>We are often interested in relationships between variables. The correlation between two numerical variables summarises their relationship; a contingency table  contains information about the relationship between two categorical variables.</p>
<p>When the individuals can be split into groups, a categorical variable can
be used to define group membership. Differences between the groups can then be
expressed as a relationship between the grouping variable and other variables.
The following questions are essentially asking the same in two different ways:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Do boys and girls aged 14 perform the same at maths?</dt>
	<dt>Is there a relationship between gender and mark in a maths test?</dt>
</dl>
<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
	evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>
	

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Relationships can be much harder to interpret than you might think</p>
</div></div>





<h2 class="pageName">8.1.2 &nbsp; Causal and non-causal relationships</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>When two variables are related, we say that there is <strong>association</strong> between them.</p>
	<p class="heading">Causal relationships</p>
	<p>A <strong>causal relationship</strong> arises when we can conclude that one variable has a <strong>direct
influence</strong> on the other.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln1.gif" width="297" height="65"></p>
	<p class="heading">Non-causal relationships</p>
	<p>In non-causal relationships, the association between the two variables is not completely the result of 
		one variable directly affecting the other.</p>
	<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">

			</tr>
	</table></div>
	<p>If two variables are <strong>not</strong> causally related, it is impossible 
		to tell whether changes to one variable, <em>X</em>, will result in changes to 
		the other variable, <em>Y</em>.</p>
	<p>The scatterplot below shows data from a sample of towns in a region. Neither variable directly affects the other. (The size of the towns is a lurking variable since larger towns have more churches and also more deaths.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/cancerChurch.gif" width="325" height="272"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Is a relationship causal?</p>
	<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
		the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
		adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change.</p>
	<p>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
	collected. <strong>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</strong></p>
	<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
	<p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables called <strong>lurking variables</strong> that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
  it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Individuals / units</p>
	<p>Most data sets consist of one or more values that are recorded from each of 
		a set of <strong>individuals</strong> (or plants, plots of land, repetitions of an experiment or 
		other 'units'). There are two different ways in which data can be collected from these units.</p>
<p class="heading">Types of data collection</p>
	<p>In an <strong>observational study</strong>, we passively 
		record (observe) values from each unit. Usually these units are sampled from some population.</p>
	<p>In an <strong>experiment</strong>, the researcher actively changes some characteristics 
		of the units before the data are collected. The values of some variables are therefore <strong>under the control of the experimenter</strong>. In other words, the experimenter 
		is able to <strong>choose</strong> each individual's values for some variables.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.1.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Observational studies and experiments</p>
	<p>The method of data collection has a major influence on whether a relationship 
		can be interpreted as causal.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Observational study</dt>
		<dd>There is usually the potential for a lurking 
				variable to underlie any observed relationship, so it is difficult to interpret 
		relationships.</dd>
		<dt>Experiment</dt>
		<dd>Provided the experiment has been designed well, there is little chance of lurking variables 
		driving the observed relationships, so any relationship will be causal.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>In a <strong>badly</strong> designed experiment however, lurking variables 
		can still cause difficulties in interpreting relationships.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">8.2.1 &nbsp; Experiments and treatments</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
	<p>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
	one or more explanatory variables.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
	<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
		Depending on the type of experiment, these units could be people, animals, trees, areas in a field, shops in a retail chain, ...</p>
	<p>In the experiments that we will examine here, a single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.</p>
	<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
	<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit. These controlled characteristics are  explanatory variables and are called <strong>factors</strong> in the context of an experiment. The different values 
		of the controlled characteristics are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>
	<p>The decision about which  treatment is applied to 
				each experimental unit is called the <strong>experimental 
	design</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="pageName">8.2.2 &nbsp; Variability in experimental units</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Differences between experimental units</p>
	<p>In practice, it is usually impossible to conduct experiments with experimental units that are identical. The experimental units usually  have 
  characteristics that vary from unit to unit.</p>
	<p>These differences between the experimental units result in variability in the response measurements that are made from them, even if all receive the same treatment.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.2.3 &nbsp; A badly designed experiment</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Bad experimental design</p>
	<p>If the treatments are allocated to experimental units in a way that is associated with their naturally varying characteristics, the apparent relationship between the treatments and the response can be distorted.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/designIntro/images/lurking2.gif" width="297" height="120"></p>
	<p>This is similar to the effect of  lurking variables in observational studies.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_varyingUnits.gif" width="371" height="334"></p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Good experimental design can avoid the potential effect of lurking 
			variables.</p>
	</div></div>
	



<h2 class="pageName">8.2.4 &nbsp; Confounding</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Confounding</p>
	<p>The design of an experiment may make it <strong>impossible</strong> to 
		disentangle the effects of the treatment and other characteristics of the experimental uits. If the treatment is perfectly correlated with another 
		variable, the effects of the two variables <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished. 
	The treatment and variable are then said to be <strong>confounded</strong>.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>It is particularly important to avoid confounding in an experiment.</p></div></div>
	<p>In an experiment, <em>treatment A</em> was applied to 10 experimental units in 2010 and <em>treatment B</em> was used on 10 similar units in 2011.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_confounded.gif" width="340" height="134"></p>
	<p>It is <strong>impossible</strong> to tell whether the higher mean response for <em>treatment A</em> than <em>treatment B</em> was caused by the different treatments or other differences between the two years.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.2.5 &nbsp; Randomisation</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Avoiding lurking variables</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>An important goal of experimental design is to minimise association 
	between allocation of the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units.</p></div></div>
	<p>If the varying characteristics of the experimental units are understood and measured before the experiment is conducted, treatments can be allocated to ensure that there is no association. (See the later page about <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('designIntro7')">blocking in experiments</a>.)</p>
	<p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
	<p>When the differing characteristics of the experimental units are unmeasured, 
		 association between them and the treatments can be minimised by randomly 
		allocating treatments to the experimental units. This is called <strong>randomisation</strong> of the treatments and the experimental design is called a <strong>completely randomised 
			design</strong>. </p>
	<p>Randomisation does not <strong>guarantee</strong> that there will be no association 
		between the treatments and characteristics of the experimental units &mdash; by chance, 
		there may be some association. However...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Randomisation means that is unlikely that such lurking 
				variables will affect the conclusions.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Mechanics of randomisation</p>
	<p>The simplest way to randomise allocation of treatments to the experimental units is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Number the available experimental units from 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Find a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
		<li>Allocate the treatments in order to the unit numbers given by the permutation.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Finding the random permutation is fairly easy in a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write the numbers 1 to <em>n</em> in a spreadsheet column</li>
		<li>Generate random numbers in an adjacent column &mdash; in Excel, type &quot;=RAND()&quot; in each cell.</li>
		<li>Select the two columns and use a menu command to sort the rows into ascending order of the random numbers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This gives a random permutation of the numbers 1 to <em>n</em>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_randomisation.gif" width="482" height="281"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.2.6 &nbsp; Replication</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Causes of variation</p>
	<p>In a completely randomised experiment,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some variation in the response measurements is caused by <strong>differences between the treatments</strong>. The experiment is conducted to discover the effect of the treatments.</li>
		<li><strong>Random variation</strong> is a catch-all that refers to all variation  that cannot 
		be explained in terms of the treatments.</li>
	</ul>
<p class="heading">Distinguishing the treatment effect and random variation</p>
	<p>To find the effect of the treatments on the response, it is essentionl that we can distinguish it from random 
	variation.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>There must be enough data to <strong>estimate random variation</strong> separately from variation caused by the treatments. </p>
	</div></div>
	<p><strong>Replication</strong> involves repeat measurements for each treatment. The variation <strong>within</strong> each treatment is all random variation.</p>
	<p>Understanding the amount of random variation is necessary before you can interpret the effect of the treatments.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/designIntro/images/s_replication.gif" width="550" height="335"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.2.7 &nbsp; Blocking</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Known differences between the experimental units</p>
	<p>When nothing is known about the differences between the experimental units 
		before the experiment is conducted, we can do no better than to randomise allocation 
		of treatments to the units.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>This design can be improved when more is known about the differences between the experimental 
				units.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Randomised block designs</p>
	<p>Ideally all experimental units are virtually identical (minimum random variation) but in practice they are often highly variable. A better design groups similar experimental units into <strong>blocks</strong>.</p>
	<p>In a <strong>randomised block design</strong>, a separate experiment is conducted within each block with  treatments  randomly allocated to its experimental units. Although all data are analysed together, the lower random variation <strong>within each block</strong>  means that differences between the treatments can be more accurately estimated.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple block design</p>
	<p>Although it is not essential,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If possible, researchers usually try to define blocks that have the same size and use each treatment the same number of times within each block. </p>
	</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Comparison of completely randomised and randomised block designs</p>
	<p>Grouping experimental units into blocks of similar units and using a randomised block design gives more accurate estimates of the treatment effects than a completely randomised design that ignores the blocks.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">8.3.1 &nbsp; Purpose</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">What is the purpose of the experiment?</p>
	<p>Before conducting an experiment it is important to clearly state its objectives.  In defining the goals of the experiment, it is 
		important that people with intimate knowledge of the process or subject area are 
	included in the team which is charged with designing and running the experiment. </p>
<p>Quite frequently,... </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A clear statement of the problem can lead to process improvement without 
				any experimentation, simply through creating a greater understanding of the process.</p>
</div></div>





<h2 class="pageName">8.3.2 &nbsp; Experimental units and measurements</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class=heading>What experimental units should be used?</p>
	<p>It is desirable for experimental units to be as similar as possible, so every
		attempt should be made to make the experimental units homogeneous.	</p>
	<p>Often however, the experimenter has little influence on the choice of experimental 
		units and must contend with whatever variability exists. Grouping them into block of similar units (and using a randomised block design) will make the results more accurate.</p>
	<p class="heading">What response variable should be recorded?</p>
	<p>In an experiment, there is sometimes a single obvious response measurement 
		from an experimental unit, but often there are several variables which can be considered 
		as response measurements.</p>
<p>A subject expert would need to decide on which 
		was most relevant to the aims of the experiment.</p>
	<p class=heading> Controlled variables</p>
	<p>Thought also needs to be given to which variables need to be controlled
		(the input variables) and what settings should be used for these variables
		in different experimental runs.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">8.3.3 &nbsp; Experiments with human subjects</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Ethical issues arise</p>
	<p>There are a few practicalities that complicate experimentation with human subjects.
		For ethical reasons, experiments involving potential danger to the subjects are not
		possible. Even if there is no known danger, the subjects should be aware of what is
		involved in the experiment and must give informed consent. </p>
	<p class=heading> Controls</p>
	<p>Treatments that involve change  should usually be compared to a  'treatment' in which there is no change. Individuals for whom there has been no change are called <strong>controls</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading> Placebos</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the act of administering a treatment to a human subject may itself
		affect the response, irrespective of the treatment effect. For example, if a drug
		is being assessed for its ability to reduce headaches, the knowledge that medication
		has been administered may make the subject feel better, even if the drug has no active
		ingredient. </p>
	<p>To avoid the psychological effect of the treatment on the subject being confounded 
		with the effect of the drug, an indistinguishable 'treatment' with no effect may 
		be given to the control group of subjects; this is called a <strong>placebo</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading> Double-blind experiments</p>
	<p>A further complication may arise when the measured response from each subject
		may be affected by knowledge of the treatment applied. If the experimenter knows
		which treatment has been applied to each experimental unit, there may be a
		subconscious tendency to systematically over- or under-assess one treatment.</p>
	<p>In a <strong>double-blind</strong> experiment, neither the experimenter 
		not the subject knows which treatment has been applied. Again, the aim is to ensure that other factors 
		do not act as lurking variables to confound comparisons of the treatments.</p>
