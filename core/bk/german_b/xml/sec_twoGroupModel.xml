	<p>Many data sets involve numerical measurements from individuals that are classified into two groups. Models are described for data with this structure.</p>

<page dir='de/twoGroupModel' filePrefix='twoGroupModel_b1'>As with single-group data, the populations underlying two-group data sets are usually of more interest than the specific sample data.</page>
<page dir='de/twoGroupModel' filePrefix='twoGroupModel_b2'>Two-group data sets are often modelled as separate random samples from two normal populations.</page>
<page dir='de/twoGroupModel' filePrefix='twoGroupModel3'>The normal model has four parameters &amp;mdash; the means and standard deviations in the two groups.</page>
<page dir='de/twoGroupModel' filePrefix='twoGroupModel4'>The parameters of the normal model can be estimated by the sample means and standard deviations in the two groups.</page>
<page dir='de/twoGroupModel' filePrefix='twoGroupModel5'>The difference between the population means is of particular interest. The difference between the sample means provides an estimate. It varies from sample to sample and has a distribution.</page>
