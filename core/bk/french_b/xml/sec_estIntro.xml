<page dir="fr/estIntro" filePrefix="estIntro_b1">When data are collected, we are usually more interested in the unknown population distribution from which we assume that the data were generated.</page>
<page dir="fr/estIntro" filePrefix="estIntro_b2">A few numerical summaries of a population distribution (parameters) often capture its most interesting characteristics. The corresponding sample statistics provide estimates.</page>
<page dir="fr/estIntro" filePrefix="estIntro3">This page gives a few examples where sample statistics are used to estimate important population parameters.</page>
<page dir="fr/estIntro" filePrefix="estIntro4">The difference between the population parameter and a sample estimate is called the error in the estimate.</page>
<page dir="fr/estIntro" filePrefix="estIntro_b5">Estimation errors vary from sample to sample and have distributions.</page>
<page dir="fr/estIntro" filePrefix="estIntro6">A good estimator has errors that are close to zero. The error distribution should ideally be centred on zero (unbiased) and have low standard deviation (standard error). The standard error is the standard deviation of both the estimator and the estimation error.</page>
<page dir="fr/estIntro" filePrefix="estIntro7">An interval estimate is a range of values within which we are 'confident' that the unknown population parameter lies.</page>
