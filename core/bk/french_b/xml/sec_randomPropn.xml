<page dir="fr/randomPropn" filePrefix="randomPropn1">The population proportion in a category is called its probability. Proportions and probabilities can be obtained from categorical and numerical variables.</page>
<page dir="fr/randomPropn" filePrefix="randomPropn2">The sample proportion is a statistic that varies from sample to sample. The sample count in a category is also random with a discrete distribution.</page>
<page dir="fr/randomPropn" filePrefix="randomPropn_b3">The sample count in a category has a standard distribution called a binomial distribution with parameters n and &amp;pi;.</page>
<page dir="fr/randomPropn" filePrefix="randomPropn_b4">The binomial distribution can be used to find probabilities relating to sample counts.</page>
<page dir="fr/randomPropn" filePrefix="randomPropn5">When the sample size is large, the distribution of the sample count in a category becomes close to a normal distribution.</page>
<page dir="fr/randomPropn" filePrefix="randomPropn_b6">When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find binomial probabilities.</page>
