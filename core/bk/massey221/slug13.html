<p class="heading">Normal Linear Model</p>

<p>Although linearity and constant variance are the most important assumptions that
are needed for the inference reported by Minitab to be reliable, we also need two more:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Normal distribution
</dt>
    <dd>The response should have a normal distribution at each value of the explanatory 
	  variable. This is an assumption about the <strong>conditional</strong> distribution 
	  of the response at each x-value not the marginal distribution. In the context 
	  of the slug data, this assumption means that the log-weights of the 5&nbsp;cm 
	  slugs should have a normal distribution. Similarly, the log-weights of the 
	  1&nbsp;cm slugs should be normally distributed, etc.</dd>

<dt>Independence
</dt>
<dd>All observations must be independently obtained. Independence is a function of how the
data were collected. It is most often violated when the observations are collected in
sequence &mdash; outside influences may affect a series of adjacent values, making them correlated.
The slug data were collected in sequence over 4 years, so there is potential for this
assumption to be violated if slugs in one year (or season) are markedly different from those
at other times.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>When all four assumptions hold &mdash; linearity, constant variance, normality 
	and independence &mdash; the model is called a <strong>normal linear model</strong>.
