<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug1'>The slug data are introduced and a scatterplot of the raw data is shown</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug2'>A least squares line is fitted to the original measurements and the curvature in the original plot is highlighted in a plot of residuals.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug3'>A lowess curve is fitted through the data, again highlighting the curvature. (Fitting lowess curves is explained in a linked page.)</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug4'>Weight, being related to volume, might be expected to be proportional to the cube of length. A transformation of length is therefore tried to linearise the relationship.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug5'>This page simply demonstrates that the least squares coefficients are random -- they would be different if a different sample of slugs was collected.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug6'>Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the parameters are described and interpreted.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug7'>The assumption of constant error variance is violated in the linear model of weight against length-cubed. It is shown that the model results in prediction intervals that are too narrow at some lengths and too wide at others.</page>
