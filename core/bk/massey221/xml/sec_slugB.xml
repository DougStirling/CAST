<section name='Linear model for log(weight)'>


<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug8'>Transformation of the response is needed to fix non-constant variance. If weight is proportional to length-cubed, the logs of the two variables will be linearly related. An outlier is evident when this model is fitted.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug9'>This page explaines how the parameters of the log-log model can be used to predict weight from length.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug10'>Prediction intervals are described. On the original axes, these intervals are much wider for long slugs than for short ones and match reasonably what would be expected from the data.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug11'>Based on Minitab output, a confidence interval for the slope is given and interpreted. </page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug12'>A test is made for whether the 'power' parameter is 3, and this is interpreted in terms of the shapes of the slugs.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug13'>The normal linear model assumptions are briefly mentioned.</page>
<page dir='bk/massey221' filePrefix='slug14'>The main four diagnostic plots are described. The diagnostic plots for the slug data are compared to those from simulated data to help assess them.</page>
