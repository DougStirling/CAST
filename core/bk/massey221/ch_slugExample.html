<p>The case study in this chapter develops a statistical model for a data set 
that describes physical characteristics of slugs. Simple models are initially 
fitted to the data set, and diagnostic plots are used to highlight problems. A 
nonlinear model is eventually discovered that fits the data well and it is used 
to gain information about the body shapes of the slugs.</p>
<p>Several of the methods that were learnt in the previous chapter are used in 
the analysis.</p>
<p>The pages in this chapter were initially written as a separate CAST module. 
They contain some buttons that display additional information in an extra window, 
but most of this extra information is already contained in the previous chapter.</p>
