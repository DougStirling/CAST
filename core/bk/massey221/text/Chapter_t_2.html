<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Case Study: Slug Data</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Linear model for weight</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; The data set</h3>
<p>The slug data are introduced and a scatterplot of the raw data is shown</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Linear model</h3>
<p>A least squares line is fitted to the original measurements and the curvature in the original plot is highlighted in a plot of residuals.</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Lowess line</h3>
<p>A lowess curve is fitted through the data, again highlighting the curvature. (Fitting lowess curves is explained in a linked page.)</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Weight vs length cubed</h3>
<p>Weight, being related to volume, might be expected to be proportional to the cube of length. A transformation of length is therefore tried to linearise the relationship.</p>
<h3>2.1.5 &nbsp; Variability of coefficients</h3>
<p>This page simply demonstrates that the least squares coefficients are random -- they would be different if a different sample of slugs was collected.</p>
<h3>2.1.6 &nbsp; Inference</h3>
<p>Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the parameters are described and interpreted.</p>
<h3>2.1.7 &nbsp; Problem with non-constant variance</h3>
<p>The assumption of constant error variance is violated in the linear model of weight against length-cubed. It is shown that the model results in prediction intervals that are too narrow at some lengths and too wide at others.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Linear model for log(weight)</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Log transform for const variance</h3>
<p>Transformation of the response is needed to fix non-constant variance. If weight is proportional to length-cubed, the logs of the two variables will be linearly related. An outlier is evident when this model is fitted.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Interpreting model for log data</h3>
<p>This page explaines how the parameters of the log-log model can be used to predict weight from length.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Predictions from log data</h3>
<p>Prediction intervals are described. On the original axes, these intervals are much wider for long slugs than for short ones and match reasonably what would be expected from the data.</p>
<h3>2.2.4 &nbsp; Confidence interval for slope</h3>
<p>Based on Minitab output, a confidence interval for the slope is given and interpreted. </p>
<h3>2.2.5 &nbsp; Testing for same slug shape</h3>
<p>A test is made for whether the 'power' parameter is 3, and this is interpreted in terms of the shapes of the slugs.</p>
<h3>2.2.6 &nbsp; Normal linear model</h3>
<p>The normal linear model assumptions are briefly mentioned.</p>
<h3>2.2.7 &nbsp; Diagnostic residual plots</h3>
<p>The main four diagnostic plots are described. The diagnostic plots for the slug data are compared to those from simulated data to help assess them.</p>
