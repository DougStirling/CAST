<p class="heading notPrinted">Information from the variation in data</p>
<p>Variation in data is not simply an annoyance &mdash; the variation itself can 
		hold important information.</p>
<p>Simply sorting a data set into order can highlight features that are not obvious in the raw data, such as the lack of values between 3.4 and 4.9 in the data below.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.1.2 &nbsp; Basic dot plot</h2>

<img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_dotPlot.gif" width="72" height="324" align="right">
<p class="heading notPrinted">Dot plots</p>
<p>Some ranges of values 
		are more common than others &mdash; they have higher <strong>density</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest graphical display of data that shows where there is high and low density is a <strong>dot
		plot</strong>. This shows each value as a cross (or dot) against a
		numerical axis.</p>
	<p>The gap between 3.4 and 4.9 is more obvious on the right than in a textual
list of values, whether ordered or not.</p>
	<br clear="all">





<h2 class="pageName">2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Jittering the crosses</p>
	<p>In all but the smallest data sets, the crosses on a basic dot plot overlap, making it difficult to identify regions of high density.</p>
	<p>Randomly moving crosses away from the axis reduces this problem by separating the crosses:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_jitteredDotPlot.gif" width="398" height="72"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Note that the vertical jittering is random and therefore tells you nothing about the data.</p>
	




<h2 class="pageName">2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Stacked dot plots</p>
	<p><strong>Stacking</strong> the crosses into columns is usually better than
jittering them.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stackedDotPlot.gif" alt="" width="400" height="150"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Stacking highlights regions of high density well (tall stacks).</p>
	


<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.2 &nbsp; Tiges et à feuilles parcelles</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.2.1 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h2>

<p class=heading>Digits instead of crosses</p>
	<p>Stem and leaf plots are closely related to stacked dot plots. The crosses are replaced by digits that provide a little more detail about the values that they represent.</p>
	<p class=heading>Stems and leaves</p>
	<p>In a stem and leaf plot, the axis is  replaced by a column of 'stems' &mdash; the most significant digits of the values in the data. The digits that replace the crosses are called 'leaves' and give a further significant digit of each value on a stem.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stemLeaf.gif" alt="" width="141" height="165"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>A final refinement is to sort the leaves into increasing order on each stem.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.2.2 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h2>

<p class=heading>Need for more flexibility</p>
	<p>Sometimes basic stem and leaf plots are not flexible enough
&mdash; there would be either too many or too few rows of leaves to show the varying
density well.</p>
	<p>Repeating each stem 2 times (with leaves 0-4 on the lower copy and leaves
5-9 on the upper one) or 5 times (with leaves 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8-9 on the
different copies) gives intermediate numbers of stems.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_splitStems.gif" alt="" width="550" height="550"><br clear="all">
	</p>



<h2 class="pageName">2.2.3 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h2>

<p class=heading>Smoothness</p>
	<p>When drawing a stem and leaf plot, the aim is for a smooth shape to the stem
and leaf plot, and this is usually achieved by between 10 and 20 rows of leaves.</p>
	<p class=heading>Drawing by hand</p>
	<p>When data are analysed on a computer, a stacked dot plot usually describes a distribution of values more clearly than a stem and leaf plot.</p>
	<p>However stem and leaf plots are easy to draw by hand:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Decide on the stems to use &mdash; usually between 10 and 20 of them.</li>
		<li>Scan down the values identifying the leaf digits and writing them against the value's stem.</li>
		<li>Finally, sort the leaves on each stem into order.<br clear="all">
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>To simplify drawing, values are truncated to give their stems and leaf digits,
not rounded. For example, 7.98 and 7.90 would both be displayed as leaf '9' on
the stem '7'.</p>



<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.3 &nbsp; Comprendre les distributions</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.3.1 &nbsp; Outliers</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Outliers</p>
	<p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data are 
		called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
	<p>An outlier may have been 
		incorrectly recorded, or there may have been other anomalous circumstances
associated with it. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything
atypical can be found, outliers should be deleted from the data set and their
deletion noted in any reports about the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Outliers and skew distributions</p>
	<p>Deciding whether a value is an outlier or not is affected by the shape of
the distribution of values for the rest of the data.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Symmetric distribution</dt>
	</dl>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/outlierSymmetric.gif" width="443" height="156"> </p>
<dl>
		<dt>Skew distribution</dt>
		<dd>A distribution with a long tail to one side is called a <strong>skew</strong> distribution
&mdash; positively skew if the long tail is to the right and negatively skew if the
long tail is to the left. It  is not unusual for the extreme value in a very
skew distribution to be a  fair distance from the other values and may not be
an outlier.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/outlierSkew.gif" width="443" height="156"> </p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.3.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>If a dot plot, stem and leaf plot or histogram separates into two or more
groups of  values (clusters), this suggests that there may be more fundamental
differences between the 'individuals' in the groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_clusters.gif" width="499" height="140"></p>
	<p>Further investigation	should be made of	the individuals in the  clusters to find whether they also differ in other ways.</p>
	<p>If the clusters were less distinct, especially in small data sets, you would need external supporting evidence before concluding that the individuals separated into meaningful groups.</p>

  


<h2 class="pageName">2.3.3 &nbsp; Distribution des valeurs</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Distribution of values</p>
	<p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, the <strong>distribution
of values</strong>  also contains useful information. Important features
are:</p>
<ul>
		<li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
		<li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
		<li>Whether a distribution is <strong>symmetric</strong> or  <strong>skew</strong> — do the tails appear similar at both sides?</li>
		<li>Other aspects of the <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 
		concepts of centre and spread are particularly important.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.4 &nbsp; Extra information about individuals</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Extra information</p>
<p>When only a single value is known from each individual (or plant, item, etc),
all that can be discovered is the shape of the distribution of these values.</p>
<p>Additional information  about each individuals
may give insight into why some values are bigger or smaller than others. Different
types of information may be available. The simplest is a unique <strong>name</strong> for
the individuals &mdash; a textual label. These names may help us to understand why
values are outliers or group into clusters in a 
dot plot or stem and leaf plot.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.5 &nbsp; Distinguer les groupes connus</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Multiple groups of individuals</p>
<p>Sometimes we know that the individuals belong to two or more groups before
the data are collected or, equivalently, that they have different values of an
extra categorical variable.</p>
<p>Information about groups is best displayed by plotting the separate groups
against a common axis.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_stackedGroups.gif" width="399" height="348"></p>
<p class="heading">Back-to-back stem and leaf plots</p>
<p>Stem and leaf plots can be used to compare two groups of individuals,
if drawn on different
sides of a common column of stems. (They are less useful if there are three or
more groups.)</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_backToBack.gif" width="264" height="249"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.6 &nbsp; Dangers de la surinterprétation</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Dangers of overinterpretation</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Features in the distribution <strong>of a small data set</strong> may not
be meaningful.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Be careful <strong>not to overinterpret</strong> patterns in small
		data sets. Clusters, outliers or skewness may appear by chance even if there is
		no meaningful basis to these features. </p>
<p>Pronounced outliers or clusters may be taken as indicative of
		something meaningful in the underlying process. However <strong>less pronounced
			outliers or clusters must be supported by outside evidence</strong> before these features
		can be interpreted as meaningful.</p>
