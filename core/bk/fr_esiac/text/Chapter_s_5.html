<p class=heading>Annual rainfall in Samaru, Nigeria</p>
	<p>In most of Africa, the most important climatic variable is rainfall. Rainfall 
		is usually highly seasonal and failure of crops is normally associated with 
		late arrival of rain or low rainfall. A better understanding of the distribution 
		of rainfall can affect the crops that are grown and when they are planted.</p>
	<p>The  annual rainfall (in mm) in Samaru, Northern Nigeria between 
	1928 and 1983 will be used as an example in this section.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">5.1.2 &nbsp; Proportions cumulatives</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Cumulative proportions</p>
<p>The proportion of 
		values in the data set that are less than or equal to any value, <em>x</em>,  is 
	called its <strong>cumulative proportion</strong>.</p>
<p>For the median and quartiles, the cumulative proportions  are:</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Proportion below</th>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<td class="top">Lower quartile</td>
<td class="top" align="center">0.25</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<td>Median</td>
<td align="center">0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<td class="bottom">Upper quartile</td>
<td class="bottom" align="center">0.75</td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>The proportion of values <strong>greater</strong> than<em> x</em> is one minus its cumulative 
	proportion,</p>
<p class=eqn> Pr(values &gt;&nbsp;<em>x</em>)&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;1 - 
	Pr(values &lt;= <em>x</em>) </p>
<p class=heading>Equality</p>
<p>For continuous data, we do not need to distinguish between the proportion of values <strong>less than</strong> <em>x</em> and the proportion that are <strong>less than or equal to</strong> <em>x</em>. Provided the values are recorded accurately enough,</p>
<ul>
	<li>these two proportions are usually equal for most <em>x</em> of interest, 
		and</li>
	<li>since the same value rarely appears more than once, the difference is 
		unlikely to be more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub><em>n</em></sub>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However for discrete data (counts)  it is  important to distinguish
the terms 'less than' and 'less than or equal to'.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.1.3 &nbsp; Graphique des proportions cumulatives</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Cumulative distribution function</p>
	<p>The cumulative proportion of values less than or equal to <em>x</em> can 
		be found for any <em>x</em>. They can be shown together in a single graph 
		of the cumulative proportion against <em>x</em>. This is called the <strong>cumulative 
			distribution function</strong> of the variable.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/percentile/images/s_cdf.gif" width="403" height="273"></p>
	<p>The cumulative distribution function for a data set with <em>n</em> values
 is a step function that rises from 0.0 below the minimum <em>x</em>-value to
1.0 at the maximum <em>x</em> in the data. It increases by <sup>1</sup>/<sub><em>n</em></sub> at
each value in the data set.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">5.2 &nbsp; Percentiles</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">5.2.1 &nbsp; Centiles</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Finding percentiles</p>
	<p>Given any proportion, <em>p</em>, 
		between 0 and 1, we can find a value <em>x</em> such that approximately this 
		proportion, <em>p</em>, of values is <em>x</em> or lower in our data set. 
		This is called the <em>p</em>'th <strong>quantile</strong> in the data set. 
		When <em>p</em> is given as a percentage, the same value is called the <em>p</em>'th <strong>percentile</strong>.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The <em>p</em>'th percentile is the value <em>x</em> such that <em>p</em> percent of the data set are <em>x</em> or lower.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>Percentiles can be read from a graph of the cumulative distribution function.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/percentile/images/s_percentile.gif" width="450" height="275"></p>
	<p class=heading>Details (optional)</p>
	<p>It may not be possible to find a value, <em>x</em>, such that <strong>exactly </strong><em>p</em> percent
of the data are lower, expecially if the sample size is not a multiple of 100.
If <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;56, the cumulative distribution function is a step
function that rises by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>56</sub> at each data value, so it is
impossible to find an <em>x</em>-value for which exactly say 43% of values are
lower.</p>
<p>There is no universally accepted general definition of percentiles and different
statistical programs give slightly different values. The differences are minor
and should not affect your interpretation of the data.</p>



<h2 class="pageName">5.2.2 &nbsp; Afficher les percentiles</h2>

<p class=heading>25, 50 and 75% percentiles</p>
	<p>The 50th percentile is the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles are the
 lower and upper quartiles. A box plot therefore shows these percentiles.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/percentile/images/s_quartiles.gif" width="404" height="326"></p>
	<p class=heading>Displaying other percentiles</p>
		<p>For some data sets, other percentiles are more important than the 25th and
 75th ones. A similar 'box' can be used to graphically display any other percentiles.
 It is best to alter the way the box is drawn to avoid confusion with the standard
 box plot.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/percentile/images/s_percentile_1090.gif" width="440" height="350"></p>
	




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.4 &nbsp; En comparant des groupes</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Joined-up quartiles</p>
	<p>Box plots are an effective way to compare the distributions of different 
		groups of values. When the groups are ordered, an alternative to the conventional 
		display of the box plots is to join up the medians, quartiles and extremes 
		of the groups in shaded bands.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/percentile/images/s_quartileBands.gif" width="550" height="313"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.5 &nbsp; En comparant des groupes d'autres percentiles</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Joined-up percentiles</p>
	<p>A similar display  can be used with other percentiles.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/percentile/images/s_percentileBands.gif" width="550" height="219"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">5.2.6 &nbsp; Une meilleure définition des centiles (Advanced)</h2>

<p class=heading>Different definitions of percentiles</p>
	<p>It was mentioned earlier that there are several competing definitions 
		of the upper and lower quartile. All such definitions split the data approximately 
		into quarters but there is not a unique way to do this.</p>
	<p>There is even less agreement about the precise definition of other percentiles, 
		and different computer software finds them in different ways. The definitions are usually based on a smoothed version of the cumulative distribution function.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/percentile/images/s_smoothCdf.gif" width="491" height="276"></p>
	<p>The differences between the different definitions are small if the data set
is large.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If your conclusion about the data would change 
				with a different definition of the percentiles, you are over-interpreting 
				the data.</p>
