<page dir="en/moreVariation" filePrefix="moreVariation1" summaryDir="en/moreVariation" summaryFilePrefix="s_moreVariation1" videoDir="en/moreVariation" videoFilePrefix="v_moreVariation1">If a data set contains an outlier, the mean and especially the standard deviation can be badly affected. The values may be obviously wrong when the 70-95-100 rule is applied in the context of the data but examining a dot plot or box plot is best.</page>
<page dir="en/moreVariation" filePrefix="moreVariation2" summaryDir="en/moreVariation" summaryFilePrefix="s_moreVariation2" videoDir="en/moreVariation" videoFilePrefix="v_moreVariation2">The standard deviation within groups is usually lower than the overall standard deviation.</page>
<page dir="en/moreVariation" filePrefix="moreVariation3" summaryDir="en/moreVariation" summaryFilePrefix="s_moreVariation3" videoDir="en/moreVariation" videoFilePrefix="v_moreVariation3">Splitting a data set into groups of 'similar' values results in more accurate predictions of future values if the group membership is known. The grouping is said to explain some of the overall variation.</page>
<page dir="en/moreVariation" filePrefix="moreVariation4" note="(advanced)" summaryDir="en/moreVariation" summaryFilePrefix="s_moreVariation4" videoDir="en/moreVariation" videoFilePrefix="v_moreVariation4">The square of the standard deviation is called the variance; its value is harder to understand but it is the basis of important advanced statistical methods. The degrees of freedom are the number of pieces of information contributing to the standard deviation (or variance).</page>
<page dir="en/moreVariation" filePrefix="moreVariation5" note="(advanced)" summaryDir="en/moreVariation" summaryFilePrefix="s_moreVariation5" videoDir="en/moreVariation" videoFilePrefix="v_moreVariation5">The root mean squared error summarises how close the values in a data set are to a target, k.</page>
<page dir="en/moreVariation" filePrefix="moreVariation6" note="(advanced)" summaryDir="en/moreVariation" summaryFilePrefix="s_moreVariation6" videoDir="en/moreVariation" videoFilePrefix="v_moreVariation6">The standard deviation is similar to the root mean squared error, but summarises distances to the mean of the data. Its value can be interpreted in terms of the average area of squares on a graph.</page>
