<page dir="en/seasonal" filePrefix="seasonal2" summaryDir="en/seasonal" summaryFilePrefix="s_seasonal2" videoDir="en/seasonal" videoFilePrefix="v_seasonal2">Moving averages with order equal to the number of seasons can smooth out seasonal variation.</page>

<page dir="en/seasonal" filePrefix="seasonal4" summaryDir="en/seasonal" summaryFilePrefix="s_seasonal4" videoDir="en/seasonal" videoFilePrefix="v_seasonal4">Subtracting the seasonal effect from the raw data is called seasonally adjusting the data and the resulting values are called deseasonalised.</page>
