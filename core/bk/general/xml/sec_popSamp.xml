<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp1" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp1" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp1">A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</page>
<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp2" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp2" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp2">A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</page>
<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp3" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp3" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp3">When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</page>
<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp4" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp4" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp4">As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </page>
<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp5" note="(optional)" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp5" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp5">Sampling with replacement from a finite population permits the same value to be selected two or more times. Sampling without replacement ensures that there are no such duplicates.</page>
<page dir="en/popSamp" filePrefix="popSamp6" summaryDir="en/popSamp" summaryFilePrefix="s_popSamp6" videoDir="en/popSamp" videoFilePrefix="v_popSamp6">Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</page>
