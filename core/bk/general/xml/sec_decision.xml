<page dir="en/decision" filePrefix="decision1" summaryDir="en/decision" summaryFilePrefix="s_decision1" videoDir="en/decision" videoFilePrefix="v_decision1">In many applications, a different action is taken if the null hypothesis is 'accepted' or 'rejected'. Two different types of error are possible from such a decision &amp;mdash; accepting the null hypothesis when it is false, or rejecting it when it is true.</page>
<page dir="en/decision" filePrefix="decision2" summaryDir="en/decision" summaryFilePrefix="s_decision2" videoDir="en/decision" videoFilePrefix="v_decision2">The decision rule is based on a sample statistic. For tests about some parameters, the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors can be calculated.</page>
<page dir="en/decision" filePrefix="decision3" summaryDir="en/decision" summaryFilePrefix="s_decision3" videoDir="en/decision" videoFilePrefix="v_decision3">Many tests are conducted with a pre-specified probability of a Type I error &amp;mdash; the significance level. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value for the test is lower than the significance level.</page>
<page dir="en/decision" filePrefix="decision4" summaryDir="en/decision" summaryFilePrefix="s_decision4" videoDir="en/decision" videoFilePrefix="v_decision4">The power of a hypothesis test is one minus the probability of a Type II error. At a fixed significance level, increasing the sample size improves the power of the test.</page>
