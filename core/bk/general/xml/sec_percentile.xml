<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile1" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile1" videoDir="en/percentile" videoFilePrefix="v_percentile1">A data set containing annual rainfalls in Samaru, Nigeria, will be used for illustrative purposes.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile2" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile2" videoDir="en/percentile" videoFilePrefix="v_percentile2">Half the data are lower than the median. A quarter and three quarters are lower than the lower and upper quartiles. At any other value, x, the proportion of data values that are x or lower is called its cumulative proportion.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile3" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile3" videoDir="en/percentile" videoFilePrefix="v_percentile3">A graph of the cumulative proportion below x against x is a step function that increases from zero (at small x) to one (at high x).</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile4" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile4" videoDir="en/percentile" videoFilePrefix="v_percentile4">Given any target proportion, p, it is possible to find a corresponding value, x, for which approximately this proportion of values is x or lower. For example, the percentile for p = 50% is the median.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile5" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile5" videoDir="en/percentile" videoFilePrefix="v_percentile5">The 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100'th percentiles are displayed as a box plot. Other percentiles can be displayed in a similar shaded rectangle.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile6" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile6" videoDir="en/percentile" videoFilePrefix="v_percentile6">Box plots are useful for comparing groups. If the groups are in order (e.g. the months of a year), the median, quartiles and extremes can be joined and shaded as bands. This effectively describes how the distribution of values varies.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile7" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile7" videoDir="en/percentile" videoFilePrefix="v_percentile7">In some applications, different percentiles are important. They can also be joined and shaded as bands to compare ordered groups.</page>
<page dir="en/percentile" filePrefix="percentile8" note="(advanced)" summaryDir="en/percentile" summaryFilePrefix="s_percentile8" videoDir="en/percentile" videoFilePrefix="v_percentile8">The graph of cumulative probabilities is a step function. Most software reports percentiles that are equivalent to reading values off a smoothed version of this step function.</page>
