<page dir="en/multiplicative" filePrefix="multiplicative1" summaryDir="en/multiplicative" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiplicative1" videoDir="en/multiplicative" videoFilePrefix="v_multiplicative1">In some time series, the different components affect the data multiplicatively rather than additively. If the data are replaced by their logs, a multiplicative model becomes additive.</page>
<page dir="en/multiplicative" filePrefix="multiplicative2" summaryDir="en/multiplicative" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiplicative2" videoDir="en/multiplicative" videoFilePrefix="v_multiplicative2">In a multiplicative model, the seasonal pattern has greater amplitude when the trend is higher.</page>
<page dir="en/multiplicative" filePrefix="multiplicative3" summaryDir="en/multiplicative" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiplicative3" videoDir="en/multiplicative" videoFilePrefix="v_multiplicative3">A multiplicative model is fitted by using an additive model with the log data. The resulting forecasts are also of the log data, and so must be back-transformed to give a forecast in the original units.</page>
<page dir="en/multiplicative" filePrefix="multiplicative4" summaryDir="en/multiplicative" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiplicative4" videoDir="en/multiplicative" videoFilePrefix="v_multiplicative4">Many types of data should be modified before attempting to interpret them in a time series plot. Seasonal adjustment, transforming to constant dollars and use of per capita data are examples.</page>
<page dir="en/multiplicative" filePrefix="multiplicative5" summaryDir="en/multiplicative" summaryFilePrefix="s_multiplicative5" videoDir="en/multiplicative" videoFilePrefix="v_multiplicative5">Time series can describe processes that are discrete or continuous, and the measurements of continuous processes can be aggregates or snap-shots. The values can also be either discrete or continuous.</page>
