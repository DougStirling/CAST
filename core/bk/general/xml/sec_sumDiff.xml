<page dir="en/sumDiff" filePrefix="sumDiff1" summaryDir="en/sumDiff" summaryFilePrefix="s_sumDiff1" videoDir="en/sumDiff" videoFilePrefix="v_sumDiff1">The mean of a random sample is approximately normal with s.d. equal to σ divided by √n. The sum of a random sample is also approximately normal, but its s.d. is σ times √n.</page>
<page dir="en/sumDiff" filePrefix="sumDiff2" summaryDir="en/sumDiff" summaryFilePrefix="s_sumDiff2" videoDir="en/sumDiff" videoFilePrefix="v_sumDiff2">The sum and difference of two independent normal variables is also normally distributed. If they have the same standard deviation, σ, the  sum and difference  both have standard deviation 1.414σ. (Their variance is 2σ².)</page>
<page dir="en/sumDiff" filePrefix="sumDiff3" summaryDir="en/sumDiff" summaryFilePrefix="s_sumDiff3" videoDir="en/sumDiff" videoFilePrefix="v_sumDiff3">This page generalises the results to the sum and difference of variables whose standard deviations may be different.</page>
<page dir="en/sumDiff" filePrefix="sumDiff4" summaryDir="en/sumDiff" summaryFilePrefix="s_sumDiff4" videoDir="en/sumDiff" videoFilePrefix="v_sumDiff4">If two variables are independent and have normal distributions, probabilities relating to their sum and difference can be found using the formulae for the mean and standard deviation of sums and differences.</page>
