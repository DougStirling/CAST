<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Summarising Relationships</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Correlation</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Units for X and Y</h3>
<p>A numerical description of the strength of a relationship should not be affected by rescaling the variables.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Units-free variables (z-scores)</h3>
<p>Standardising a variable gives z-scores that do not depend on the units of the original variable. (The correlation coefficient will be defined in terms of z-scores for X and Y.)</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Correlation coefficient</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient summarises the strength of the relationship between X and Y. It is +1 when the scatterplot crosses are on a straight line with positive slope, -1 when on a line with negative slope, and zero when X and Y are unrelated.</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Scatterplots and the value of r</h3>
<p>You should be able to estimate the value of r from looking at a scatterplot and imagine a scatter of crosses corresponding to any value of r.</p>
<h3>2.1.5 &nbsp; Nonlinear relationships</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient is only a good measure of the strength of a relationship if the points in a scatterplot are scattered round a straight line, not a curve.</p>
<h3>2.1.6 &nbsp; R does not tell the whole story</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient cannot identify curvature, outliers or clusters and can be misleading if these features are present. A scatterplot must always be examined too.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Least squares</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Predicting Y from X</h3>
<p>A line or curve is useful for predicting the value of Y from a known value of X.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Linear models</h3>
<p>A straight line can often be used to predict one variable from another.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Fitted values and residuals</h3>
<p>The difference between the actual value of Y and the value predicted by a line is called a residual. Small residuals are clearly desirable.</p>
<h3>2.2.4 &nbsp; Least squares</h3>
<p>The sum of squared residuals describes the accuracy of predictions from a line. The method of least squares positions the line to minimise the sum of squared residuals.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Simple diagnostics</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; Curvature and outliers</h3>
<p>A linear model is not appropriate if there are either curvature or outliers in a scatterplot of the data. Outliers should be carefully examined.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Residual plots</h3>
<p>Outliers and curvature in the relationship are often displayed more clearly in a plot of residuals.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Predicting Y and predicting X</h3>
<p>Least squares does not treat Y and X symmetrically. The best line for predicting Y from X is different from the best line for predicting X from Y.</p>
