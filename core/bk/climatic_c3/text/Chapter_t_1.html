<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; Relationships between Variables</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Bivariate data sets</h3>
<p>Many data sets contain two or more measurements from each individual. Even when the main interest is in one variable, the others can help to understand its distribution.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h3>
<p>The main display that shows the relationship between two variables is a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h3>
<p>Univariate displays don't show relationships between variables.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>A scatterplot of two variables can be enhanced with box plots or histograms on the margins of a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>1.1.5 &nbsp; Time series</h3>
<p>When a single measurement is made at regular intervals, the data are called a time series. Time series data can be treated as bivariate, with time being the second variable.</p>
<h2>1.2 &nbsp; Understanding relationships</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 &nbsp; Strength of a relationship</h3>
<p>The main feature of interest in a scatterplot is the strength of the relationship between the two variables.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>An extreme value of one or both of the variables is an outlier. An unusual combination of values is also called an outlier.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>If the crosses on a scatterplot separate into clusters, different groups of individuals are suggested.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h3>
<p>In small data sets, there may be considerable variability, so patterns should be strongly evident before they are reported.</p>
<h3>1.2.5 &nbsp; Explanatory and response variables</h3>
<p>One variable can often be classified as an explanatory variable that either causally affects the reponse variable, or is useful for predicting its value.</p>
<h2>1.3 &nbsp; Bivariate categorical distributions</h2>
<h3>1.3.1 &nbsp; Relationships between variables</h3>
<p>If two categorical variables can be treated as a response and explanatory variable, the explanatory variable can be used to split the individuals into groups. If neither variable can be treated as explanatory, we need other ways to describe their association.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 &nbsp; 3-dimensional bar charts</h3>
<p>Bivariate distributions can be displayed in 3-dimensional bar charts but there are better ways to show the data.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 &nbsp; Clustered bar charts</h3>
<p>A 2-dimensional bar chart can be used to display the joint distribution of two categorical variables, with the bars clustered by one or other of the variables.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>The two marginal distributions are found by adding the joint frequencies (or proportions) across rows or down columns of a contingency table.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 &nbsp; Conditional distributions</h3>
<p>Conditional distributions are obtained by scaling the rows (or columns) of a contingency table to make them all sum to 1.0.</p>
<h3>1.3.6 &nbsp; More about conditional distributions</h3>
<p>Be careful to distinguish between the conditional distribution of Y given X, and that of X given Y.</p>
<h3>1.3.7 &nbsp; Conditional vs marginal distns</h3>
<p>Proportional Venn diagrams are a useful way to display joint distributions and to understand the relationships between conditional and marginal distributions.</p>
