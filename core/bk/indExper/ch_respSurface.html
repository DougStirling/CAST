  <p>After the number of 'important' factors has been reduced to two or three, 
		it is possible to investigate in more detail how these factors affect the 
		response. When the factors are numerical, it is possible to model the mean 
		response with a nonlinear function of the factors. The experimental design 
		must involve three or more levels of each factor in order to fit a model that 
		has quadratic terms in all factors.</p>
	<p>If the factors are proportions of ingredients that must add to one, a similar 
		quadratic model is used, but the experiment must be designed in a different 
		way. </p>
