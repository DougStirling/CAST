<page dir='en/oneFactorInd' filePrefix='oneFactorInd1'>In the simplest type of experiment, there are no known differences between the experimental units and a single factor is varied. In a completely design, the different levels of the factor are randomly allocated to the pool of experimental units.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactorInd' filePrefix='oneFactorInd2'>This page gives a few data sets from completely randomised experiments for a single factor.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactorInd' filePrefix='oneFactorInd3'>Varying the controlled factor causes variability in the response -- explained variation. Other response variability remains unexplained.</page>
<page dir='en/oneFactorInd' filePrefix='oneFactorInd4'>The mean responses at the different factor levels summarise differences between the treatments -- the explained variation.</page>
