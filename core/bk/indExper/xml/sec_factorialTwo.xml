<page dir='en/factorialTwo' filePrefix='factorialTwo_i1'>In an experiment for two factors, treatments are combinations of levels for the factors. A factorial experiment uses the same number of replicates for all possible treatments and randomly allocates them to the experimental units.</page>
<page dir='en/factorialTwo' filePrefix='factorialTwo_i2'>This page shows examples of factorial experiments for two factors.</page>
<page dir='en/factorialTwo' filePrefix='factorialTwo3'>Sometimes the effect of changing one factor depends on the level of the other factor. A factorial experiment is needed to assess this interaction between factors.</page>
<page dir='en/factorialTwo' filePrefix='factorialTwo4'>In an experiment for one factor, a second factor can be varied without reducing the accuracy of the estimate for the first factor. It is far more efficient to assess two factors in a single factorial experiment than in separate experiments for the two factors.</page>
<page dir='en/factorialTwo' filePrefix='factorialTwo_i5' note='(advanced)'>Sometimes two factors are thought to affect a response but in an experiment they cannot be independently adjusted. In other experiments, it is impossible to set the value of the 'controlled' factor precisely so the factor level varies randomly.</page>
