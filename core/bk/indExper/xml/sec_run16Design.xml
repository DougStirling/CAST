<page dir='en/run16Design' filePrefix='run16Design1'>A complete factorial experiment for 4 factors can be designed with 16 runs. All main effects and interactions can be estimated.</page>
<page dir='en/run16Design' filePrefix='run16Design2'>If factor E is confounded with the 4-factor interaction between A, B, C and D in a complete factorial experiment for these 4 factors, all main effects and 2-factor interactions can be independently estimated.</page>
<page dir='en/run16Design' filePrefix='run16Design3'>The additional factors E, F, G and H should be confounded with 3-factor interactions between A, B, C and D. The factors are orthogonal and are not confounded with 2-factor interactions, but some 2-factor interactions are confounded with others.</page>
<page dir='en/run16Design' filePrefix='run16Design4'>The factors E, F, ... can be confounded with any selection of the interactions between A, B, C and D. When there are 9 or more factors, it is impossible to avoid confounding main effects with 2-factor interactions.</page>
