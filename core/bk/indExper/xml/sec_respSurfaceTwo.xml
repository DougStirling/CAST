<page dir='en/respSurfaceTwo' filePrefix='respSurfaceTwo1'>Nonlinear relationships between a response and two numerical factors can be modelled by adding quadratic terms and an interaction to the linear model.</page>
<page dir='en/respSurfaceTwo' filePrefix='respSurfaceTwo2'>The quadratic model defines a surface that can take various different shapes, and may have a maximum, minimum or saddle point, depending on the values of the model parameters.</page>
<page dir='en/respSurfaceTwo' filePrefix='respSurfaceTwo3'>The quadratic model cannot be fitted using data from a factorial experiment in which both factors take two levels, even if augmented with centre points. A central composite design adds 'star points' to the factorial model.</page>
<page dir='en/respSurfaceTwo' filePrefix='respSurfaceTwo4'>The quadratic model corresponds to a surface in 3 dimensions. Contours on this surface can be used to represent the surface on paper.</page>
<page dir='en/respSurfaceTwo' filePrefix='respSurfaceTwo5'>An analysis of variance table can be used to test the significance of the model terms.</page>
