<page dir='en/runOtherDesign' filePrefix='runOtherDesign1'>The number of runs in a fractional factorial design must be a power of 2. A table shows the resolution possible for designs with up to 64 runs.</page>
<page dir='en/runOtherDesign' filePrefix='runOtherDesign2'>For 8-11 factors, a Plackett-Burman design uses only 12 runs, as opposed to the 16 runs needed for a fractional factorial experiment. The factors are still orthogonal.</page>
<page dir='en/runOtherDesign' filePrefix='runOtherDesign3'>A Plackett-Burman design for 16-19 factors in 20 runs is much less expensive than the 32 runs needed for a fractional factorial experiment. Plackett-Burman designs exist for any multiple of 4 runs.</page>
<page dir='en/runOtherDesign' filePrefix='runOtherDesign4'>Repeating the runs in a resolution III design with the high and low levels for all factors swapped, results in a resolution IV design. Foldover designs can be used sequentially to augment a previous resolution III design. Some foldover Plackett-Burman designs are resolution IV designs with fewer runs than any fractional factorial design.</page>
