<page dir='en/incompleteFact' filePrefix='incompleteFact1'>In many studies with a high number of potential factors, an initial experiment is conducted to identify which factors are most important.</page>
<page dir='en/incompleteFact' filePrefix='incompleteFact2'>The number of runs for a complete factorial design increases exponentially with the number of factors. Even a single replicate can be prohibitively expensive if there are many factors. </page>
<page dir='en/incompleteFact' filePrefix='incompleteFact3'>There are experimental designs that for a subset of the runs needed for a complete factorial experiment. Such a design should ensure that all factors are orthogonal.</page>
<page dir='en/incompleteFact' filePrefix='incompleteFact4'>If there are fewer runs than required for a complete factorial, it is impossible to independently estimate all possible interactions between factors -- some interactions get mixed up (confounded) with main effects and other interactions.</page>
