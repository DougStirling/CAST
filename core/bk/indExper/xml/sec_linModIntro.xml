<section name='Model for response'>


<page dir='en/linModIntro' filePrefix='linModIntro1'>The response is usually modelled as the sum of two terms, a term for explained variation that depends on the factor level and a random term with a normal distribution describing unexplained variation.</page>
<page dir='en/linModIntro' filePrefix='linModIntro2'>If the relationship between the response and x is nonlinear, the mean response can be modelled with a quadratic function of x. An even more general model uses a separate parameter for the mean response at each x that is used; it is also appropriate for a categorical explanatory variable.</page>
<page dir='en/linModIntro' filePrefix='linModIntro3'>The simplest model for an experiment with one numerical controlled variable, x, is a linear model in which the mean response is a linear function of x.</page>
<page dir='en/linModIntro' filePrefix='linModIntro4'>All models involve unknown parameters. The least squares estimates of the parameters minimise the sum of squared residuals.</page>
<page dir='en/linModIntro' filePrefix='linModIntro5'>If only 2 values of a numerical factor are used in an experiment, a linear model has identical fit to a model that treats the factor as categorical. If 3 values of the factor have been used, a quadratic model is equivalent to a model that treats the factor as categorical.</page>
<page dir='en/linModIntro' filePrefix='linModIntro6'>Evenly spaced values of a numerical factor can be replaced by any other evenly spaced values, such as 1, 2, ... without changing the fit of the model. A numerical or categorical factor with 2 levels is often modelled as a numerical factor with values -1 and +1.</page>
