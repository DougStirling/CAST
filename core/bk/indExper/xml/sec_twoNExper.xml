<page dir='en/twoNExper' filePrefix='twoNExper1'>If several factors must be assessed, factorial designs with more than 2 levels per factor usually involve too many runs of the experiment.</page>
<page dir='en/twoNExper' filePrefix='twoNExper2'>The factor levels can be coded as -1 and +1 and treated as numerical variables. The main effects for the factors are differences between the response means at the two levels.</page>
<page dir='en/twoNExper' filePrefix='twoNExper3'>Interactions can be modelled with terms that are products of the +/-1 values of the coded main effect variables. The main effects and interactions are orthogonal in a factorial design.</page>
<page dir='en/twoNExper' filePrefix='twoNExper4'>If there are no replicates, the full model with all interactions has no residual degrees of freedom. Some high-order interactions must be negligible (assumed to be zero) before tests can be performed.</page>
<page dir='en/twoNExper' filePrefix='twoNExper5'>A half-normal probability plot of the main effects and interactions can guide the choice of terms to contribute to the residual sum of squares.</page>
<page dir='en/twoNExper' filePrefix='twoNExper6'>Two-dimensional plots of the mean response against each factor can display the main effects and interactions.</page>
<page dir='en/twoNExper' filePrefix='twoNExper7'>If all factors are numerical, an alternative to replicating the complete design or assuming that high-order interactions are negligible is to conduct several runs of the experiment at an average level for all factor. This allows tests of all interactions and also provides a test for linearity.</page>
