<section name='Quadratic model for three factors'>


<page dir='en/respSurfaceThree' filePrefix='respSurfaceThree1'>A factorial experiment using 2 levels for each factor must be augmented by star points to allow a quadratic model to be fitted. An alternative is to use a Box-Behnken design in which each factor only takes 3 different levels. </page>
<page dir='en/respSurfaceThree' filePrefix='respSurfaceThree2'>A quadratic model for three factors defines a surface in 4 dimensions. It can be displayed as 'slices' through this 4-dimensional surface at fixed values of one factor.</page>
<page dir='en/respSurfaceThree' filePrefix='respSurfaceThree3'>The significance of the quadratic model's terms can be tested in an analysis of variance table. Care must be taken when a response surface is interpreted since deletion of insignificant terms may changes its shape.</page>
