  <p>If an experiment is being designed for a small number of factors, a complete 
		factorial design can be used. Ideally the design should be replicated or, 
		if all factors are numerical, additional experimental runs might be conducted 
		at the centre point of the design in order to estimate the error variance.</p>
	<p>However the number of runs of the experiment required for a full factorial 
		design increases exponentionally as the number of factors increase. If there 
		are many factors, a complete factorial is prohibitively expensive, so alternative 
		experimental designs should be used that require far fewer runs than a complete 
		factorial.</p>
