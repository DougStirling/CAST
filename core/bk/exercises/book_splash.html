<p class="heading">Important statistical skills</p>

<p>Statistical methods are always used in the context of a problem in some applied 
discipline such as medicine, business, economics, ecology, etc. Important skills 
are: </p>

<ul>
<li>collection of information that is relevant to the problem,</li>
<li>selection of an appropriate way to analyse the data, and</li>
<li>using the results of the analysis to answer questions in the context and terminology 
of the application area.</li>
</ul>

<p>These skills are best learned through project work, but there are limited ways 
in which CAST can support large and open-ended projects.</p>
<p class="heading">Exercises</p>
<p>However there is a toolbox of statistical concepts and methods that should 
be mastered before embarking on project work. Exercises are short focused questions 
that provide a convenient way to gain mastery of the skills that are required 
for projects.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The exercises in this e-book are designed to help students learn the 
toolbox of statistical methods that are needed to solve practical problems.</p>
</div></div>

	
<p>It must however be remembered that these short exercises only cover some of 
the skills needed to become a competent user of statistics. Students also need 
some experience with practical problems, real data and open-ended questions through 
project work.</p>
<p>Such project work is beyond the scope of the current exercises in CAST.</p>
