<page dir='en/sumDiff' filePrefix='e_sumDiff1'>This page gives an exercise that asks for a probability relating to the sum of difference of two independent variables.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='e_twoGroupInf1'>This page asks for a probability about either the difference between two single variables or two group means.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='e_twoGroupInf2'>Two exercises on this page ask confidence intervals about the difference between two group means based on sample means and standard deviations; the second is a little harder than the first.</page>
<page dir='en/twoGroupInf' filePrefix='e_twoGroupInf3'>This page provides an exercise that gives practice in evaluating p-values for hypothesis tests and interpreting them.</page>
