<page dir='en/testPropn' filePrefix='e_testPropn1'>The exercise in this page asks you to use a binomial distribution to perform a hypothesis test about a population proportion and interpret the results.</page>
<page dir='en/testPropn' filePrefix='e_testPropn2'>The exercise in this page uses a normal approximation to find the p-value for the above test.</page>
<page dir='en/testPropn' filePrefix='e_testPropn3'>The p-value is found more accurately if a continuity correction is used with a normal distribution. This exercise is similar to the previous one but requires use of a continuity correction.</page>
