<section name='Proportions and percentiles'>


<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='e_percentile1'>In this page, you will draw cumulative distribution functions based for various data sets. In the first exercise, the cdf is drawn from the individual data values (displayed as a dot plot); in the second, the values are grouped into classes (as a histogram).</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='e_percentile2'>In the two exercises on this page, you should identify which of a set of cumulative distribution functions matches each of a set of dot plots or histograms.</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='e_percentile3'>In this exercise, a proportion should be expressed as a percentage, a rate per x values, or a rate of once per y values (return period)</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='e_percentile4'>An exercise gives practice at finding proportions from the cumulative distribution function of real climatic data.</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='e_percentile5'>This is similar to the exercise on the previous page but asks for a mixture of percentages, rates and return periods.</page>
<page dir='en/percentile' filePrefix='e_percentile6'>In this page, two exercises give practice at finding percentiles, again based on the cumulative distribution function of climatic data.</page>
