<section name='Confidence interval for mean'>


<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='e_ciMean1'>This exercise displays an estimate and standard error and asks for an approximate 95% confidence interval. Various different types of parameters are estimated (not just means).</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='e_ciMean2'>This exercise gives practice with the calculations for finding the 95% confidence interval for a mean when the population standard deviation is known.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='e_ciMean3'>This exercise is similar to the previous one but requires use of a t distribution since the population standard deviation is unknown.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='e_ciMean4'>In this exercise, confidence intervals are requested with a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels, but with known population standard deviation.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='e_ciMean5'>In this exercise, the questions involve a mixture of types with known and unknown population standard deviation and with 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='e_ciMean6'>This exercise asks how the sample size, sample standard deviation and confidence level affect the width of a CI for the mean.</page>
<page dir='en/ciMean' filePrefix='e_ciMean7'>In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</page>
