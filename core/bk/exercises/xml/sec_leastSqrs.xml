<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='e_leastSqrs1'>For several scenarios, you must identify the explanatory variable and response, then state whether the data are observational or experimental and whether the relationship is causal.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='e_leastSqrs2'>This exercise shows the equation of a straight line and asks you to sketch it.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='e_leastSqrs3'>The exercises on this page do the inverse of the previous exercise -- you are shown a straight line and asked to find its equation.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='e_leastSqrs4'>In this exercise, you are asked to select one of four statements that correctly describes the slope or intercept of a least squares line in the context of the data.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='e_leastSqrs5'>This exercise requests the least squares residual for a cross on a scatterplot.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='e_leastSqrs6'>In this exercise, you must identify which of four scatterplots is the correct residual plot when a linear model is fitted to a data set.</page>
<page dir='en/leastSqrs' filePrefix='e_leastSqrs7'>The exercise on this page gives a least squares line and asks for a prediction of the response, given the value of the explanatory variable.</page>
