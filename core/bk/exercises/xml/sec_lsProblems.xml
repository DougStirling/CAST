<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='e_curvature1'>This exercise asks you to identify the difficulties with using the least squares line to predict Y at a given X from the data in a displayed scatterplot (an outlier, curvature, a high-leverage point or extrapolation).</page>
<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='e_curvature2'>You are asked whether a logarithmic transformation of X or Y might linearise the data in a scatterplot (and also give constant variability).</page>
<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='e_curvature3'>In this exercise, a least squares line is fitted to a model that involves log(X) and/or log(Y). You are asked to use the equation of the line to predict Y from X.</page>
<page dir='en/curvature' filePrefix='e_curvature4'>This exercise shows a scatterplot of Y vs X, followed by three scatterplots involving transformations of Y and X (log, square and square root transformations). You are asked to match the scatterplots to the transformations.</page>
