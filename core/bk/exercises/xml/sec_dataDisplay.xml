<section name='Graphical displays'>
<topText><![CDATA[
	<p>The first four exercises in this section are about drawing different displays of data. It can be argued that these are not  important skills since a computer can produce them for you. However the exercises check that you understand how they are formed.</p>
	<p>The last three exercises are about interpreting these graphical displays.</p>

<page dir='en/valueDisplay' filePrefix='e_valueDisplay1'>In the two exercises on this page, you will drag leaves to form stem and leaf plots from a list of values. The second exercise creates stem and leaf plots with split stems. </page>
<page dir='en/valueDisplay' filePrefix='e_valueDisplay2'>This exercise asks you to drag the final two crosses of a stacked dot plot into the correct places of the display.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='e_boxPlot1'>The exercises on this page involve drawing box plots from sorted lists of values. For the second exercise, 'outliers' must be separately identified.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='e_density1'>In this page, you will draw histograms of different data sets.</page>
<page dir='en/boxPlot' filePrefix='e_boxPlot2'>The exercises on this page involve matching the shape of box plots to the corresponding dot plots.</page>
<page dir='en/density' filePrefix='e_density2'>The two exercises in this page ask you to use the shape of a histogram to find the proportion of values in a given range. The first exercise shows the number of values in each class, but the second requires the histogram area to be estimated 'by eye'.</page>
<page dir='en/displayInterp' filePrefix='e_displayInterp1'>In this exercise, you will interpret what distributions with symmetry, skewness, clusters or outliers tell you about the data.</page>
