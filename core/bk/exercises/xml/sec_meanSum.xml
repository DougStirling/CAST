<section name='Distribution of sample means and sums' shortName='Distributions of means &amp;amp; sums'>


<page dir='en/randomMean' filePrefix='e_randomMean1'>This exercise shows the distribution of the mean or sum of values from samples of different sizes from a normal population. You must match the distributions with their sample sizes.</page>
<page dir='en/randomMean' filePrefix='e_randomMean2'>This exercise examines understanding of the limiting normal distribution of the sample mean and sum as sample size increases, whatever the shape of the population distribution.</page>
<page dir='en/randomMean' filePrefix='e_randomMean3'>In this exercise, pop-up menus are used to specify the centre, spread and skewness of the distribution of a sample mean, sample sum or a single value, given the population distribution.</page>
<page dir='en/randomMean' filePrefix='e_randomMean4'>This exercise asks for the probability that the mean, the sum or a single value from a sample lies within some interval. Templates are provided to help evaluate the parameters of the sampling distribution and the z-scores for the endpoints of the interval.</page>
