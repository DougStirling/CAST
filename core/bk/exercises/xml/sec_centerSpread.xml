<section name='Describing centre and spread'>


<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='e_centerSpread1'>In this exercise, you should summarise the difference between two distributions in terms of their different centres and spreads.</page>
<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='e_centerSpread2'>An exercise requests estimates of the mean and median from different skew and symmetric stacked dot plots.</page>
<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='e_centerSpread3'>The first exercise asks for a rough 'guess' at the standard deviation of data sets from a stacked dot plot. The second exercise is similar but displays the data as a histogram or box plot.</page>
<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='e_centerSpread4'>In this exercise, general knowledge about the type of measurement is enough to roughly guess the value of the standard deviation.</page>
<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='e_centerSpread5'>The mean and standard deviation of a data set should give you a good idea of the likely distribution of values. The first exercise in this page asks you to sketch a stacked dot plot to match a given mean and standard deviation. In the second, a histogram should be drawn.</page>
<page dir='en/centerSpread' filePrefix='e_centerSpread6'>The two exercises on this page ask the effect of combining different groups of values or adding an outlier on the mean and standard deviation.</page>
