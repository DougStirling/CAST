<page dir='en/probSim' filePrefix='e_probSim1'>This exercise asks for probabilities about a card drawn at random from a standard pack of playing cards or when two dice are rolled.</page>
<page dir='en/probSim' filePrefix='e_probSim2'>A finite categorical population is shown as a bar chart and the probability of a randomly sampled value being in a range of categories must be found.</page>
<page dir='en/probSim' filePrefix='e_probSim3'>This exercise is simlar to the one on the previous page but relates to a numerical population that is summarised by a histogram. The probability must be estimated roughly 'by eye' from the area under the histogram.</page>
<page dir='en/probSim' filePrefix='e_probSim4'>In this exercise, probabilities are obtained from the areas under a probability density function.</page>
<page dir='en/probSim' filePrefix='e_probSim5'>This exercise relates to pairs of numbers drawn with or without replacement from a small finite population. The question asks for a probability about either the sum or difference of the two numbers.</page>
