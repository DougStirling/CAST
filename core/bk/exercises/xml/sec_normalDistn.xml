<section name='Normal distributions'>


<page dir='en/normalDistn' filePrefix='e_normalDistn1'>One exercise asks you to guess the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Another requests a sketch of a normal distribution given its mean and standard deviation.</page>
<page dir='en/normalDistn' filePrefix='e_normalDistn2'>Exercise asks for a normal probability by reading an area under a normal histogram (pdf).</page>
<page dir='en/normalDistn' filePrefix='e_normalDistn3'>The two exercises on this page are similar to the previous exercise, but the question must be first translated into one involving a z-score. In the first exercise, the required probability is read off a standard normal histogram (pdf); in the second, a normal table must be used.</page>
<page dir='en/normalDistn' filePrefix='e_normalDistn4'>Instead of the probability of getting a value within some range, the questions in this exercise ask for the expected number out of n items. </page>
<page dir='en/normalDistn' filePrefix='e_normalDistn5'>The two exercises on this page ask the inverse problem; given a probability, they ask for the corresponding range of values. The first exercise uses a standard normal histogram (pdf) to find the answer, whereas the second uses a normal table.</page>
<page dir='en/normalDistn' filePrefix='e_normalDistn6'>The exercise on this page asks a variety of different questions of the types above about normal distributions. The reader must pick the type of question before using the templates and normal table to answer.</page>
<page dir='en/normalDistn' filePrefix='e_normalDistn7'>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb gives the approximate probability of a value within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. Te exercise uses this rule of thumb to find some normal probabilities without formal calculations.</page>
