<p>The CAST e-book of exercises is still a work-in-progress and only the first 
seven chapters have been developed at present. More exercises about  models and inference for comparing groups and for regression are planned for a later release.</p>
<p>However older versions of CAST contained a few exercises about comparison of groups and regression and these have been included here 
in the hope that they will be of some use to the reader.</p>
