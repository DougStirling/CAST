<h1>Chapter 8 &nbsp; Comparing Groups</h1>
<h2>8.1 &nbsp; Comparing two means</h2>
<h3>8.1.1 &nbsp; Probabilities about sums and differences</h3>
<p>This page gives an exercise that asks for a probability relating to the sum of difference of two independent variables.</p>
<h3>8.1.2 &nbsp; Probabilities about differences</h3>
<p>This page asks for a probability about either the difference between two single variables or two group means.</p>
<h3>8.1.3 &nbsp; CI for difference between two means</h3>
<p>Two exercises on this page ask confidence intervals about the difference between two group means based on sample means and standard deviations; the second is a little harder than the first.</p>
<h3>8.1.4 &nbsp; Testing group means for equality</h3>
<p>This page provides an exercise that gives practice in evaluating p-values for hypothesis tests and interpreting them.</p>
<h2>8.2 &nbsp; Comparing two proportions</h2>
<h3>8.2.1 &nbsp; CI for difference between two proportions</h3>
<p>Two exercises on this page ask confidence intervals about the difference between two group proportions based on sample proportions; the second is a little harder than the first.</p>
<h3>8.2.2 &nbsp; Test about difference between two proportions</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for the hypotheses, p-value and conclusion when testing whether two group proportions are equal, both with one- and two-tailed alternatives.</p>
<h2>8.3 &nbsp; Paired data</h2>
<h3>8.3.1 &nbsp; 2-sample or paired t-test</h3>
<p>This exercise presents 3 different scenarios and asks whether the two means in each scenario should be compared with a 2-sample or a paired t-test.</p>
<h3>8.3.2 &nbsp; Conduct paired t-test</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you are presented with a set of paired data and asked to perform a test about whether the two means are equal.</p>
<h2>8.4 &nbsp; Comparing many groups</h2>
<h3>8.4.1 &nbsp; Anova table formulae</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page shows four formulae relating to an Anova table and ask you to match them with textual descriptions of how they are interpreted.</p>
<h3>8.4.2 &nbsp; Anova table values</h3>
<p>This exercise gives an analysis of variance table and asks you to find a few values from it.</p>
<h3>8.4.3 &nbsp; Conclusion from Anova table</h3>
<p>This exercise shows an analysis of variable table and asks for the conclusion, described in the context of the problem.</p>
<h2>8.5 &nbsp; Association in contingency tables</h2>
<h3>8.5.1 &nbsp; Expected cell counts</h3>
<p>This exercise shows a contingency table and asks for the expected cell count in one of the table cells, assuming the row and column variables are independent.</p>
<h3>8.5.2 &nbsp; Chi-squared test for independence</h3>
<p>In this exercise, the test statistic and p-value are provided for a chi-squared test applied to a contingency table. You are asked to interprete the result of the test.</p>
