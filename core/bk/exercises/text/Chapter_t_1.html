<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; One Numerical Variable</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Graphical displays</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>In the two exercises on this page, you will drag leaves to form stem and leaf plots from a list of values. The second exercise creates stem and leaf plots with split stems. </p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to drag the final two crosses of a stacked dot plot into the correct places of the display.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; Box plots</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page involve drawing box plots from sorted lists of values. For the second exercise, 'outliers' must be separately identified.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 &nbsp; Histograms</h3>
<p>In this page, you will draw histograms of different data sets.</p>
<h3>1.1.5 &nbsp; Shape of a box plot</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page involve matching the shape of box plots to the corresponding dot plots.</p>
<h3>1.1.6 &nbsp; Histogram areas and proportions</h3>
<p>The two exercises in this page ask you to use the shape of a histogram to find the proportion of values in a given range. The first exercise shows the number of values in each class, but the second requires the histogram area to be estimated 'by eye'.</p>
<h3>1.1.7 &nbsp; Information from distributions</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will interpret what distributions with symmetry, skewness, clusters or outliers tell you about the data.</p>
<h2>1.2 &nbsp; Describing centre and spread</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 &nbsp; Ideas of centre and spread</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you should summarise the difference between two distributions in terms of their different centres and spreads.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 &nbsp; Mean and median</h3>
<p>An exercise requests estimates of the mean and median from different skew and symmetric stacked dot plots.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 &nbsp; Standard deviation from graph</h3>
<p>The first exercise asks for a rough 'guess' at the standard deviation of data sets from a stacked dot plot. The second exercise is similar but displays the data as a histogram or box plot.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 &nbsp; Standard deviation from general knowledge</h3>
<p>In this exercise, general knowledge about the type of measurement is enough to roughly guess the value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>1.2.5 &nbsp; Rough graph from mean and st devn</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation of a data set should give you a good idea of the likely distribution of values. The first exercise in this page asks you to sketch a stacked dot plot to match a given mean and standard deviation. In the second, a histogram should be drawn.</p>
<h3>1.2.6 &nbsp; Clusters and outliers (advanced)</h3>
<p>The two exercises on this page ask the effect of combining different groups of values or adding an outlier on the mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h2>1.3 &nbsp; Proportions and percentiles</h2>
<h3>1.3.1 &nbsp; Cumulative distribution functions</h3>
<p>In this page, you will draw cumulative distribution functions based for various data sets. In the first exercise, the cdf is drawn from the individual data values (displayed as a dot plot); in the second, the values are grouped into classes (as a histogram).</p>
<h3>1.3.2 &nbsp; Shape of the cumulative distribution function</h3>
<p>In the two exercises on this page, you should identify which of a set of cumulative distribution functions matches each of a set of dot plots or histograms.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 &nbsp; Percentages, rates and return periods</h3>
<p>In this exercise, a proportion should be expressed as a percentage, a rate per x values, or a rate of once per y values (return period)</p>
<h3>1.3.4 &nbsp; Percentages from cumulative distn function</h3>
<p>An exercise gives practice at finding proportions from the cumulative distribution function of real climatic data.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 &nbsp; Rates and return periods from c.d.f.</h3>
<p>This is similar to the exercise on the previous page but asks for a mixture of percentages, rates and return periods.</p>
<h3>1.3.6 &nbsp; Percentiles</h3>
<p>In this page, two exercises give practice at finding percentiles, again based on the cumulative distribution function of climatic data.</p>
<h2>1.4 &nbsp; Transformations</h2>
<h3>1.4.1 &nbsp; Linear transformations</h3>
<p>In this exercise, a data set is shown and a question is asked about the proportion of values that are less than a cutoff which is expressed in different units.</p>
<h3>1.4.2 &nbsp; Mean and st devn after linear transformations</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks for the mean and standard deviation of a data set after linear transformation.</p>
<h3>1.4.3 &nbsp; Nonlinear transformations</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you are asked to identify which of three nonlinearly transformed dot plots correspond to square, log and square root transformations of a data set. </p>
