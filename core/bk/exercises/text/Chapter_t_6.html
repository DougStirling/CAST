<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Estimating Parameters</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Populations and samples</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Distinction between populations and samples</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks whether three statements describe populations or samples.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Distinction between parameters and estimates</h3>
<p>This exercise asks whether three statements describe parameters or estimates.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Standard error</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Standard error of mean</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page shows a data set with the sample mean and st devn. The standard error of the mean must be calculated.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>This exercise states the value of either the standard deviation or the standard error or the mean. The question asks for an interval containing about 95% of the values or an interval with 95% confidence of including the popn mean.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Factors affecting the standard deviation and standard error</h3>
<p>This exercise asks 3 questions about the effect of sample size and spread of sample values on the sd and se, and about the interpretation of the se and sd.</p>
<h2>6.3 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean</h2>
<h3>6.3.1 &nbsp; Confidence interval from standard error</h3>
<p>This exercise displays an estimate and standard error and asks for an approximate 95% confidence interval. Various different types of parameters are estimated (not just means).</p>
<h3>6.3.2 &nbsp; 95% confidence interval, known sigma</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice with the calculations for finding the 95% confidence interval for a mean when the population standard deviation is known.</p>
<h3>6.3.3 &nbsp; 95% confidence interval, unknown sigma</h3>
<p>This exercise is similar to the previous one but requires use of a t distribution since the population standard deviation is unknown.</p>
<h3>6.3.4 &nbsp; Other confidence levels, known sigma</h3>
<p>In this exercise, confidence intervals are requested with a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels, but with known population standard deviation.</p>
<h3>6.3.5 &nbsp; Mixture of levels, known &amp; unknown Ïƒ</h3>
<p>In this exercise, the questions involve a mixture of types with known and unknown population standard deviation and with 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels.</p>
<h3>6.3.6 &nbsp; Factors affecting width of CI</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, sample standard deviation and confidence level affect the width of a CI for the mean.</p>
<h3>6.3.7 &nbsp; Interpreting a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</p>
<h2>6.4 &nbsp; Estimating proportions</h2>
<h3>6.4.1 &nbsp; Standard error of proportion</h3>
<p>A template is provided in this exercise to help evaluate the standard error of a sample proportion.</p>
<h3>6.4.2 &nbsp; 95% confidence interval for probability</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice at evaluating an approximate 95% confidence interval for a probability.</p>
<h3>6.4.3 &nbsp; Other confidence levels</h3>
<p>This exercise requests a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence intervals for a probability. A normal density can be used to find the relevant z-score and a template helps evaluate the 'plus-minus' value.</p>
<h3>6.4.4 &nbsp; Factors affecting width of confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, confidence level and population probability affect the width of a CI for the probability.</p>
<h3>6.4.5 &nbsp; Interpreting a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise presents 3 different statements about a 95% confidence interval and asks which is correct.</p>
