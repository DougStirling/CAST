<p>Variability in a set of measurements is often explained by random sampling 
from some population or distribution and probability is used to describe the resulting 
randomness.</p>
<p>The normal and binomial distributions are the two most commonly used distributions 
in statistics. In particular, the sum and mean of a random sample have distributions 
that are close to normal if the sample size is large.</p>
