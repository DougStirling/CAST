<h1>Chapter 3 &nbsp; Two Numerical Variables</h1>
<h2>3.1 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 &nbsp; More than one variable</h3>
<p>Many data sets contain two or more measurements from each individual. Even when the main interest is in one variable, the others can help to understand its distribution.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h3>
<p>The main display that shows the relationship between two variables is a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 &nbsp; Limitations of univariate displays</h3>
<p>Univariate displays don't show relationships between variables.</p>
<h3>3.1.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>A scatterplot of two variables can be enhanced with box plots or histograms on the margins of a scatterplot.</p>
<h3>3.1.5 &nbsp; Time series</h3>
<p>When a single measurement is made at regular intervals, the data are called a time series. Time series data can be treated as bivariate, with time being the second variable.</p>
<h2>3.2 &nbsp; Understanding relationships</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 &nbsp; Strength of a relationship</h3>
<p>The main feature of interest in a scatterplot is the strength of the relationship between the two variables.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 &nbsp; Outliers</h3>
<p>An extreme value of one or both of the variables is an outlier. An unusual combination of values is also called an outlier.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 &nbsp; Clusters</h3>
<p>If the crosses on a scatterplot separate into clusters, different groups of individuals are suggested.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h3>
<p>In small data sets, there may be considerable variability, so patterns should be strongly evident before they are reported.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 &nbsp; Explanatory and response variables</h3>
<p>One variable can often be classified as an explanatory variable that either causally affects the reponse variable, or is useful for predicting its value.</p>
<h2>3.3 &nbsp; Correlation</h2>
<h3>3.3.1 &nbsp; Units for X and Y</h3>
<p>A numerical description of the strength of a relationship should not be affected by rescaling the variables.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 &nbsp; Units-free variables (z-scores)</h3>
<p>Standardising a variable gives z-scores that do not depend on the units of the original variable. (The correlation coefficient will be defined in terms of z-scores for X and Y.)</p>
<h3>3.3.3 &nbsp; Correlation coefficient</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient summarises the strength of the relationship between X and Y. It is +1 when the scatterplot crosses are on a straight line with positive slope, -1 when on a line with negative slope, and zero when X and Y are unrelated.</p>
<h3>3.3.4 &nbsp; Scatterplots and the value of r</h3>
<p>You should be able to estimate the value of r from looking at a scatterplot and imagine a scatter of crosses corresponding to any value of r.</p>
<h3>3.3.5 &nbsp; Nonlinear relationships</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient is only a good measure of the strength of a relationship if the points in a scatterplot are scattered round a straight line, not a curve.</p>
<h3>3.3.6 &nbsp; R does not tell the whole story</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient cannot identify curvature, outliers or clusters and can be misleading if these features are present. A scatterplot must always be examined too.</p>
<h2>3.4 &nbsp; 最小二乘法</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 &nbsp; 从X预测Y</h3>
<p>要从已知的X的值预测Y的值，一条直线或曲线是有用的。</p>
<h3>3.4.2 &nbsp; 线性模型</h3>
<p>一条直线(一种线性关系)经常被用来从一个变量预测另一个变量。</p>
<h3>3.4.3 &nbsp; 拟合值和残差</h3>
<p>Y的真实值与由线性关系得到的预测值的差被称为残差。很明显小的残差更 合我们的意。</p>
<h3>3.4.4 &nbsp; 最小二乘</h3>
<p>残差平方和描述线性预测的精确性。最小二乘法是通过最小化残差平方和 从而获得所要的直线</p>
<h3>3.4.5 &nbsp; 弯曲和异常点</h3>
<p>当从数据的散点图可以观察到曲线关系或异常点时，线性模型不再适用。 异常点应当被仔细地检查。</p>
<h3>3.4.6 &nbsp; 残差图</h3>
<p>在残差图中异常点和曲线关系会被更明显地显示。</p>
<h3>3.4.7 &nbsp; 预测Y和X(高级部分)</h3>
<p>在最小二乘法里，Y和X不是被同样地对待。通过X预测Y得到的最佳线性关 系和通过Y预测X得到的最佳线性关系是不同的。</p>
<h2>3.5 &nbsp; Nonlinear relationships</h2>
<h3>3.5.1 &nbsp; Transformations and correlation</h3>
<p>The correlation coefficient does not adequately describe the strength of a nonlinear relationship. Transforming the variables to linearise the relationship helps.</p>
<h3>3.5.2 &nbsp; Transformations and models</h3>
<p>If a relationship is nonlinear, a linear model can often be fitted to transformed response or explanatory variables.</p>
<h3>3.5.3 &nbsp; Quadratic models</h3>
<p>An alternative solution to nonlinearity is to fit a quadratic curve the data, again using the principle of least squares.</p>
<h3>3.5.4 &nbsp; Dangers of extrapolation</h3>
<p>Since the form of a relationship is unknown beyond the range of x-values in the data, it is always dangerous to extrapolate.</p>
