<p>When only a single
measurement is made from each individual (or unit) in a group, we
cannot associate variation in that measurement with other
characteristics of the individuals &mdash; all variation is <strong>unexplained</strong>.
</p> <p>When two or more measurements are made from each
individual, we may be be able to associate variation in one measurement
with changes in the other measurements; this can <strong>explain</strong>
some of the variation. If two measurements are made from each
individual, the data are called <strong>bivariate</strong>.
Examples are ... </p>
<ul> <li>Blood pressure and weight of males in their 50s</li>
<li>Floor area and sale price of houses in a town</li> <li>Carbohydrate
content and moisture content of corn</li>
</ul><p>Our aim with such data is to find information about
the <strong>relationship</strong>
between the variables. New methods of graphical
and numerical summary are required to capture this information.
