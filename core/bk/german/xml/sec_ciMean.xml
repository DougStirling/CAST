<section name='Confidence interval for mean'>

<page dir='de/ciMean' filePrefix='ciMean1'>The estimation error for any unbiased estimator, has approximately 0.95 probability of being between -2SE and +2SE. An approximate 95% confidence interval for the parameter is therefore the estimate &amp;plusmn; 2SE.</page>
<page dir='de/ciMean' filePrefix='ciMean2'>If the population standard deviation is known, the standard error can be found exactly. A 95% confidence interval is the sample mean &amp;plusmn; twice this. (Or more exactly, 1.96 times the standard error.)</page>
<page dir='de/ciMean' filePrefix='ciMean3'>A simulation shows that 95% confidence intervals are random &amp;mdash; they vary from sample to sample. About 95% of samples give confidence intervals that include the true parameter.</page>
<page dir='de/ciMean' filePrefix='ciMean4'>In practice, the population standard deviation is usually unknown. If the population SD is simply replaced by its sample equivalent, the interval estimate has a lower confidence level than 95%.</page>
<page dir='de/ciMean' filePrefix='ciMean5'>To get a 95% confidence level, a t-value from tables must replace the constant 1.96.</page>
<page dir='de/ciMean' filePrefix='ciMean6'>A simulation demonstrates that the resulting 95% confidence intervals have probability 0.95 of including the population mean.</page>
<page dir='de/ciMean' filePrefix='ciMean7'>Some examples of 95% confidence intervals for population means are given and interpreted.</page>
