	<p>If categorical data are collected from two groups of individuals, we are usually interested in comparing the proportions in the categories.</p>

<page dir='de/twoGroupPropn' filePrefix='twoGroupPropn1'>Two-group categorical data can be modelled as samples from two categorical populations with different probabilities of 'success'.</page>
<page dir='de/twoGroupPropn' filePrefix='twoGroupPropn2'>The difference between two sample proportions has a distribution that is approximately normal and whose parameters can be estimated using earlier results about the mean and standard deviation of differences.</page>
<page dir='de/twoGroupPropn' filePrefix='twoGroupPropn3'>The standard deviation of the difference between two sample proportions can be estimated. From this, a 95% confidence interval is developed for the difference between two probabilities.</page>
<page dir='de/twoGroupPropn' filePrefix='twoGroupPropn4'>A hypothesis test is developed to assess whether two population probabilities are the same.</page>
