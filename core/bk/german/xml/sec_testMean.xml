<section name='Tests about means'>

<page dir='de/testMean' filePrefix='testMean1'>For numerical populations, the null and alternative hypotheses usually specify values for the population mean. Tests are based on the sample mean.</page>
<page dir='de/testMean' filePrefix='testMean2'>When testing a single parameter, we often use a test statistic that 'standardises' an estimate of the parameter &amp;mdash; subtracting the hypothesised value and dividing by its standard error. This test statistic describes the statistical distance of the estimate from the null hypothesis value and has a distribution that is close to a standard normal distribution.</page>
<page dir='de/testMean' filePrefix='testMean3'>The p-value can be easily derived if the population standard deviation is known. The p-value is approximately correct even when the population distribution is not normal.</page>
<page dir='de/testMean' filePrefix='testMean4'>When the population standard deviation is unknown, a different test statistic must be used. It has a standard distribution known as a t distribution.</page>
<page dir='de/testMean' filePrefix='testMean5'>The t distribution is used to obtain a p-value for tests about a population mean when the standard deviation is unknown.</page>
