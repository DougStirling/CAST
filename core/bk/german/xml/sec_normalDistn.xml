<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn1">Normal distributions are sometimes useful as models for data, but the main reason for their importance is that sample means and many other summary statistics have approximately normal distributions.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn2">All normal distributions look the same on a scale of standard deviations from the mean.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn3">Normal distributions are centred on their mean, µ, and have hardly any area beyond 3&#963;  on each side. A small area (about 5%) is over 2 standard deviations away from the mean.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn4">The probabilities of being within (&#963;, 2&#963;, and 3&#963;) of the mean are (0.68, 0.95 and 0.997) for all normal distributions. This is a close match to the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb for numerical data sets.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn5">Any value, x, can be translated into a z-score that gives the number of standard deviations above the mean.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn6">Z-scores have a standard normal distribution (µ = 0 and &#963; = 1). The probability of a value less than x can be translated into a probability about a z-score.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn7">The probability that X is greater than a specified value or is between two values can also be translated into a probability about a z-score.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn8">If a computer is not available, tables of probabilities for the standard normal distribution are used to find normal probabilities.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn9">The inverse problem of finding the x-value corresponding to a given probability is also solved using z-scores. If normal tables are used, they must be looked up differently.</page>
<page dir="de/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn10" note="(advanced)">A normal probability plot is an informal graphical method to help assess whether a data set comes from a normal distribution. Curvature in the probability plot suggests that the data may not be normal.</page>
