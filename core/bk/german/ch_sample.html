<p>Most data sets contain one or more measurements from each of a
collection of
individuals (or other units). The measurements of interest usually vary
in ways that cannot
be explained in terms of other measurements from the individuals.
</p><p>This unexplained variability can be modelled by
considering the data
to be a random sample from some underlying population.
</p><p>Modelling unexplained variability in this way allows
us
to better assess features in the data. In particular, we can use it
to assess the stability (and hence accuracy) of summary statistics,
such as a sample mean
or sample proportion.
