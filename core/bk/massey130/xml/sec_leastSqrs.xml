<page dir="en/leastSqrs" filePrefix="leastSqrs3" summaryDir="en/leastSqrs" summaryFilePrefix="s_leastSqrs3" videoDir="en/leastSqrs" videoFilePrefix="v_leastSqrs3">The difference between the actual value of Y and the value predicted by a line is called a residual. Small residuals are clearly desirable.</page>
<page dir="en/leastSqrs" filePrefix="leastSqrs4" summaryDir="en/leastSqrs" summaryFilePrefix="s_leastSqrs4" videoDir="en/leastSqrs" videoFilePrefix="v_leastSqrs4">The sum of squared residuals describes the accuracy of predictions from a line. The method of least squares positions the line to minimise the sum of squared residuals.</page>

Outliers should be carefully examined.</page>

The best line for predicting Y from X is different from the best line for predicting X from Y.</page>
