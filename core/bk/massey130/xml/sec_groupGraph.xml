<section name="Bar charts to compare groups">

<page dir="bk/massey130" filePrefix="groupGraph1" summaryDir="bk/massey130" summaryFilePrefix="s_groupGraph1">Tables of grouped data are often displayed graphically with bar charts. Bar charts of proportions within groups are usually easier to compare than bar charts of the raw values.</page>
<page dir="en/groupGraph" filePrefix="groupGraph3" summaryDir="en/bivarCat" summaryFilePrefix="s_bivarCat3">The bars can be clustered together by group or by category.</page>
<page dir="en/groupGraph" filePrefix="groupGraph4" summaryDir="en/groupedCat" summaryFilePrefix="s_groupedCat4">If there are many groups, stacking the bars often makes it easier to compare the groups.</page>
<page dir="en/groupGraph" filePrefix="groupGraph5" summaryDir="en/groupGraph" summaryFilePrefix="s_groupGraph5">If there are only two categories in each group, there is no need to present both proportions. A simple bar chart of one proportion is sufficient and allows the scale to be expanded if the proportion is small for all groups.</page>
<page dir="en/groupGraph" filePrefix="groupGraph6" summaryDir="en/bivarCat" summaryFilePrefix="s_bivarCat2">Three-dimensional versions of clustered and stacked bar charts make it harder to understand the data and can be misleading.</page>
