<page dir="en/correlation" filePrefix="correlation3" summaryDir="en/correlation" summaryFilePrefix="s_correlation3" videoDir="en/correlation" videoFilePrefix="v_correlation3">The correlation coefficient summarises the strength of the relationship between X and Y. It is +1 when the scatterplot crosses are on a straight line with positive slope, -1 when on a line with negative slope, and zero when X and Y are unrelated.</page>
<page dir="en/correlation" filePrefix="correlation4" summaryDir="en/correlation" summaryFilePrefix="s_correlation4" videoDir="en/correlation" videoFilePrefix="v_correlation4">You should be able to estimate the value of r from looking at a scatterplot and imagine a scatter of crosses corresponding to any value of r.</page>
<page dir="en/correlation" filePrefix="correlation6" summaryDir="en/correlation" summaryFilePrefix="s_correlation6" videoDir="en/correlation" videoFilePrefix="v_correlation6">The correlation coefficient cannot identify curvature, outliers or clusters and can be misleading if these features are present. A scatterplot must always be examined too.</page>
