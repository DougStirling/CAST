<page dir="bk/massey120" filePrefix="e_valueDisplay1">In the two exercises on this page, you will drag leaves to form stem and leaf plots from a list of values. The second exercise creates stem and leaf plots with split stems. </page>
<page dir="bk/massey120" filePrefix="e_boxPlot1">This exercise asks you to drag the final two crosses of a stacked dot plot into the correct places of the display.</page>
<page dir="bk/massey120" filePrefix="e_density1b">The exercises on this page involve drawing box plots from sorted lists of values. For the second exercise, 'outliers' must be separately identified.</page>


<page dir="en/univarCat" filePrefix="e_univarCat3">In this exercise, you will produce a Pareto diagram by reordering the bars of a bar chart, then find a proportion or percentage relating to the most important or least important categories.</page>

<page dir="en/transform" filePrefix="e_transform1">In this exercise, a data set is shown and a question is asked about the proportion of values that are less than a cutoff which is expressed in different units.</page>
<page dir="en/transform" filePrefix="e_transform2">The exercise on this page asks for the mean and standard deviation of a data set after linear transformation.</page>
<page dir="en/transform" filePrefix="e_transform3">In this exercise, you are asked to identify which of three nonlinearly transformed dot plots correspond to square, log and square root transformations of a data set. </page>

<page dir="en/curvature" filePrefix="e_curvature2" nameOverride="Transformations for regression">You are asked whether a logarithmic transformation of X or Y might linearise the data in a scatterplot (and also give constant variability).</page>
<page dir="en/curvature" filePrefix="e_curvature3">In this exercise, a least squares line is fitted to a model that involves log(X) and/or log(Y). You are asked to use the equation of the line to predict Y from X.</page>
<page dir="en/curvature" filePrefix="e_curvature4">This exercise shows a scatterplot of Y vs X, followed by three scatterplots involving transformations of Y and X (log, square and square root transformations). You are asked to match the scatterplots to the transformations.</page>
