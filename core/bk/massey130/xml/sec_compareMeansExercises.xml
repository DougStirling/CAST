<page dir="en/twoGroupInf" filePrefix="e_twoGroupInf1" note="Optional# (Optional)">This page asks for a probability about either the difference between two single variables or two group means.</page>
<page dir="en/twoGroupInf" filePrefix="e_twoGroupInf2">Two exercises on this page ask confidence intervals about the difference between two group means based on sample means and standard deviations; the second is a little harder than the first.</page>
<page dir="en/twoGroupInf" filePrefix="e_twoGroupInf3" nameOverride="Testing two group means for equality">This page gives an exercise in which you will find p-values for hypothesis tests about equality of two means and interpreting them.</page>
<page dir="en/testPaired" filePrefix="e_testPaired1">This exercise presents 3 different scenarios and asks whether the two means in each scenario should be compared with a 2-sample or a paired t-test.</page>
<page dir="en/testPaired" filePrefix="e_testPaired2">In this exercise, you are presented with a set of paired data and asked to perform a test about whether the two means are equal.</page>
<page dir="en/multiGroup" filePrefix="e_multiGroup1">The exercise on this page shows four formulae relating to an Anova table and ask you to match them with textual descriptions of how they are interpreted.</page>
<page dir="en/multiGroup" filePrefix="e_multiGroup2">This exercise gives an analysis of variance table and asks you to find a few values from it.</page>
<page dir="en/multiGroup" filePrefix="e_multiGroup3">This exercise shows an analysis of variable table and asks for the conclusion, described in the context of the problem.</page>
