<p>This  CAST e-book has been designed for the paper <em>161.130 Introductory

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideoButton('Show introductory video');</script>

<p>After looking at the introductory video, you can move directly to Chapter 1 where you will learn about the importance of using data when making decisions, typical data structures and the need to use statistics to get useful information from data.</p>

<p>Note that on some pages, there is a small triangle in the top right corner. This is a menu from which you can see  different versions of the page with perhaps business examples or other non-biological ones.</p>
