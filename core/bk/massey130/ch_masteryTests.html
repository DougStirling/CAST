  <p>The initial chapters of this CAST e-book overlap with the New Zealand high school syllabus (NCEA).</p>
  <p>In the Massey University paper 161.120, this initial material is assessed by three online mastery tests:</p>
  <dl>
  	<dt>Mastery Test 1</dt>
  	<dd>This test examines the material in Chapters 2 and 3 of the e-book &mdash; basic graphical and numerical summaries of a single variable.</dd>
  	<dt>Mastery Test 2</dt>
  	<dd>The second test examines the material in Chapters 4 and 5 &mdash; relationships between two numerical variables, contingency tables and time series.</dd>
  	<dt>Mastery Test 3</dt>
  	<dd>The last test examines the material in Chapters 6, 7 and 8 &mdash; probability, normal distributions and binomial distributions.</dd>
</dl>
	<p>The three sections below contain questions that are almost identical to those that will be asked in the mastery tests, but they give more help and feedback about wrong answers.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We strongly encourage you to try the exercises in this chapter before attempting the mastery tests.</p>
