<p class="heading">Ordering</p>
	
<p>Sometimes the categories in a table or bar chart have a natural ordering. For 
example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Mortality rates and other demographic information is often tabulated by age 
group</li>
<li>In education, participation and achievement is often tabulated by educational 
level</li>
<li>Characteristics of prisoners are often tabulated by the length of their sentence 
or number of previous sentences</li>
<li>Many tables show how a summary value changes over a period of years</li>
</ul>
<p>In such tables, the categories should be kept in this natural order.</p>
<p>When there is no natural ordering of the categories, the order of the categories 
in a table or bar chart is arbitrary. For example, in a frequency table (or the 
corresponding bar chart) of causes of death, there is no natural way to order 
the causes (heart disease, stroke, accident,&nbsp;...) so they can be placed in 
any order on a bar chart.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Alphabetical ordering of the categories is rarely best.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Ordering by size</p>
	
<p>When there is no natural ordering of categories, it is often useful to arrange 
them in decreasing order of their values. The larger values are often more 'important' 
in some way, so this ordering helps them to stand out.</p>
<p>When this type of ordered bar chart is drawn for values that are a partition 
of some total, it is often called a <strong>Pareto diagram</strong>. It is named 
after an Italian economist in the late 1800's who found that about 80 percent 
of the wealth of a region was concentrated in less than 20 percent of the population. 
(Pareto diagrams are particularly useful in industrial quality control and quality 
improvement where information is collected about the causes of problems in manufacturing 
processes.)</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>However if there is a category 'Other' or 'Unknown', then it should be kept
at the end, even if its value is larger than others.</p>

<p class="heading">R&amp;D expenditure in OECD</p>

<p>The barchart below shows the expenditure on Research and Development in all 
OECD countries in 2005 (or the latest available figures), expressed as a percentage 
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>

<p>The countries are initially arranged alphabetically. Click the checkbox <strong>Sorted 
values</strong> to rearrange them in decreasing order of R&amp;D expenditure. 
In the reordered table, it is easier to identify the countries with highest and 
lowest R&amp;D expenditure and to understand the rank of individual countries.</p>
