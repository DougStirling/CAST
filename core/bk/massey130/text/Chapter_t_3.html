<h1>Chapter 3 &nbsp; Summary Statistics</h1>
<h2>3.1 &nbsp; Median, quartiles &amp; box plots</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h3>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain detailed information that is distracting when two or more data sets are being compared.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h3>
<p>The median and quartiles split a batch of values into four equal-sized sets of values. A box plot is a graphical display of the median, quartiles and extremes.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 &nbsp; Interpreting a box plot's shape</h3>
<p>A box plot clearly shows the centre, spread and skewness of a data set. It splits the corresponding histogram into 4 approximately equal areas.</p>
<h3>3.1.4 &nbsp; Comparison of groups</h3>
<p>Box plots are particularly effective for displaying differences between several groups of values.</p>
<h3>3.1.5 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h3>
<p>Box plots are relatively stable, and contain less 'noise' than other displays. They can concisely describe differences between even small groups.</p>
<h2>3.2 &nbsp; Describing centre and spread</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 &nbsp; Centre and spread</h3>
<p>The centre of a distribution is a 'typical value'. The spread describes how far the values are from the centre.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 &nbsp; Median, range and IQR</h3>
<p>The median is a summary of the centre of a distribution. The range and inter-quartile range both describe spread.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 &nbsp; Summaries of centre</h3>
<p>The median and mean are alternative measures of the centre of a distribution.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 &nbsp; Properties of median and mean</h3>
<p>When a data set is not symmetric, the mean and median may differ substantially.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h3>
<p>The standard deviation is the most commonly used numerical summary of the spread of values in a data set.</p>
<h3>3.2.6 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb is useful for understanding the numerical value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>3.2.7 &nbsp; Understanding means and st devns</h3>
<p>It is possible to roughly guess the mean and standard deviation from a histogram and roughly sketch a symmetric histogram matching any given mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>3.2.8 &nbsp; Warnings about mean &amp; st devn</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation cannot give any indication of the existance of outliers, skewness or clusters. A dot plot or histogram should be examined before reporting these numerical summaries.</p>
<h3>3.2.9 &nbsp; Mean and st devn for discrete data</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation can be evaluated easily from a frequency table.</p>
