<h2>12.1 &nbsp; Lurking variables</h2>
<h3>12.1.1 &nbsp; Misleading marginal correlation</h3>
<p>Variables Y and X may be positively correlated overall, but have zero or even negative correlation at each value of a categorical variable, Z. The variable Z is called a lurking (or hidden) variable.</p>
<h3>12.1.2 &nbsp; Misleading marginal difference in means</h3>
<p>A lurking variable can also distort the difference between the means of Y in two groups (i.e. for two values of a categorical variable, X).</p>
<h3>12.1.3 &nbsp; Simpsons paradox</h3>
<p>If X, Y and Z are all categorical, a reversal of the marginal relationship between X and Y and their conditional relationships for different values of Z is called Simpson's paradox.</p>
<h3>12.1.4 &nbsp; Other examples with lurking variables</h3>
<p>A few extra examples are shown where a hidden variable, Z, can result in a misleading conclusion from the marginal relationship. A full analysis using Z is always more complex but is essential to understand the relationship.</p>
<h2>12.2 &nbsp; Different sampling schemes</h2>
<h3>12.2.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h3>
<p>More accurate estimates can sometimes be obtained by taking separate random samples within different parts of the population.</p>
<h3>12.2.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h3>
<p>When individuals are grouped in clusters, it is often cheaper to sample complete clusters rather than separate individuals.</p>
<h3>12.2.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling</h3>
<p>When the target population is spread over a wide area, it may be cheaper to take a sample from only a few regions (groups of individuals), than to sample from all the regions.</p>
<h2>12.3 &nbsp; Experiments with blocks</h2>
<h3>12.3.1 &nbsp; Variability of experimental units</h3>
<p>In most experiments, the experimental units that are available differ from each other and this variability results in less accurate estimates of the effect of the treatment.</p>
<h3>12.3.2 &nbsp; Blocks of similar experimental units</h3>
<p>There is often enough information about differences between the experimental units before the experiment begins to allow them to be grouped into similar blocks of units.</p>
<h3>12.3.3 &nbsp; Randomised block design</h3>
<p>If the experimental units have been grouped into similar blocks, a randomised block design randomly allocates treatments separately within each block.</p>
<h3>12.3.4 &nbsp; Randomised block examples</h3>
<p>This page shows a few data sets from randomised block experiments.</p>
<h3>12.3.5 &nbsp; Comparison of designs</h3>
<p>Randomised block designs result in more accurate estimates of the effects of the factors of interest than in a completely randomised experiment with the same experimental units.</p>
