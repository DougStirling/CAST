<h1>Chapter 11 &nbsp; Data Presentation</h1>
<h2>11.1 &nbsp; Presenting data in tables</h2>
<h3>11.1.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>11.1.2 &nbsp; Gridlines and white space</h3>
<p>Never use gridlines to box all values in a table. In large multi-column tables, reading across rows is easier with occasional hairlines of light shading, but otherwise consider using white space to separate associated groups of rows or columns.</p>
<h3>11.1.3 &nbsp; Layout and annotation</h3>
<p>Use white space to group related rows and columns. Rearranging rows or columns may bring values that should be compared closer. Summarise and interpret in the body of a report but do not simply repeat values.</p>
<h3>11.1.4 &nbsp; Significant digits and data noise</h3>
<p>The meaningful information is 'signal'. Information that does not help understanding of the data is 'noise'. Noise includes data noise and unnecessary embellishments to the table. Decreasing the significant digits displayed often decreases data noise.</p>
<h3>11.1.5 &nbsp; Meaningful variables</h3>
<p>Showing proportions in a multi-column table instead of frequencies makes it easier to compare groups. Ratios of variables can be easier to interpret than their raw values.</p>
<h3>11.1.6 &nbsp; Swapping rows and columns</h3>
<p>It is easier to compare values down rows than across columns. Interchanging the rows and columns of a table can make it easier to make comparisons.</p>
<h3>11.1.7 &nbsp; Reordering rows</h3>
<p>Rearranging the rows (or columns) may make the information in large tables stand out better.</p>
<h3>11.1.8 &nbsp; Example</h3>
<p>An example shows a published table whose presentation can be improved in many ways.</p>
<h2>11.2 &nbsp; Presenting bar and pie charts</h2>
<h3>11.2.1 &nbsp; Bar charts</h3>
<p>The simplest graphical display of a table of values is a bar chart. The bars can be drawn either vertically or horizontally. If the values are partitions of a total, a second axis with percentages can be added.</p>
<h3>11.2.2 &nbsp; Ordering of categories</h3>
<p>If there is no natural ordering of the categories in a bar chart, it is often informative to arrange them in decreasing order of the values. If the values are partitions of a total, cumulative percentages can be added.</p>
<h3>11.2.3 &nbsp; Importance of zero and -ve values</h3>
<p>If possible, all bars should start at zero, so bar length is proportional to the values. If the axis does not include zero, this should be clearly indicated with zig-zags on the bars or axis. Negative values can be represented with bars hanging below the axis.</p>
<h3>11.2.4 &nbsp; Chartjunk</h3>
<p>Three-dimensional representations of bar charts should be avoided.</p>
<h3>11.2.5 &nbsp; Misleading bar charts</h3>
<p>It is misleading to replace simple bars with 2- or 3-dimensional objects whose height represents the values since the visual impression depends on the area or volume of the objects.</p>
<h3>11.2.6 &nbsp; Chartjunk for pie charts</h3>
<p>Three-dimensional pie charts should be avoided.</p>
<h3>11.2.7 &nbsp; Misleading stacked bar charts</h3>
<p>Avoid splitting a picture into segments to form a stacked bar chart. The resulting picture often misrepresents the values for the different categories.</p>
<h2>11.3 &nbsp; Bar charts to compare groups</h2>
<h3>11.3.1 &nbsp; Bar charts of frequencies and proportions</h3>
<p>Tables of grouped data are often displayed graphically with bar charts. Bar charts of proportions within groups are usually easier to compare than bar charts of the raw values.</p>
<h3>11.3.2 &nbsp; Clustered bar charts</h3>
<p>The bars can be clustered together by group or by category.</p>
<h3>11.3.3 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts</h3>
<p>If there are many groups, stacking the bars often makes it easier to compare the groups.</p>
<h3>11.3.4 &nbsp; Two categories</h3>
<p>If there are only two categories in each group, there is no need to present both proportions. A simple bar chart of one proportion is sufficient and allows the scale to be expanded if the proportion is small for all groups.</p>
<h3>11.3.5 &nbsp; Chartjunk</h3>
<p>Three-dimensional versions of clustered and stacked bar charts make it harder to understand the data and can be misleading.</p>
<h2>11.4 &nbsp; Other ways to present data</h2>
<h3>11.4.1 &nbsp; Distinguishing groups</h3>
<p>The crosses on a scatterplot can be coloured to distinguish different groups, or differing symbols can be used.</p>
<h3>11.4.2 &nbsp; Showing size</h3>
<p>Scatterplots are often used when the crosses correspond to different geographical regions. If these differ in size, the crosses can be replaced by circles whose area is proportional to the size ï¿½ e.g. area, population or GDP.</p>
<h3>11.4.3 &nbsp; Dynamic scatterplots</h3>
<p>Changes over time can be animated and this is particularly useful for scatterplots. When the crosses represent countries or regions, it is often possible to pick out ones that behave differently from the rest. </p>
<h3>11.4.4 &nbsp; Maps with pie and bar charts</h3>
<p>Maps can have other simple bar and pie charts superimposed on each region. Only simple information about each region should be displayed in this way.</p>
<h3>11.4.5 &nbsp; Distorted population maps</h3>
<p>In most conventional maps, the areas of the regions are proportional to their land areas. The shapes of the regions can be distorted to make their areas proportional to their populations.</p>
<h3>11.4.6 &nbsp; Other distorted maps</h3>
<p>It is sometimes informative to distort a map to make the areas of regions proportional to other measurements. These measurements must be partitions of a meaningful total so that the combined measurement for two regions would be their total.</p>
<h2>11.5 &nbsp; Data presentation principles</h2>
<h3>11.5.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>11.5.2 &nbsp; Types of publication</h3>
<p>Information may be published in executive reports, for archival purposes or in documents for the general public. Publication is increasingly done electronically rather than on paper. Resolution, availability of colour, production cost and ease of formatting are issues that should be considered.</p>
<h3>11.5.3 &nbsp; From data to information</h3>
<p>Reports generally only summarise the most important features of the available data. Identifying the important features is subjective and is similar to extracting the signal from a noisy electronic communication.</p>
<h3>11.5.4 &nbsp; Tables, graphs and text</h3>
<p>Reports should contain a balance of tables, graphs and text. Annotations on graphs can highlight important features.</p>
<h3>11.5.5 &nbsp; Combining simple graphs</h3>
<p>Several simple graphs can sometimes be linked together in a single display. They should usually be either drawn on a common time axis or a map.</p>
<h3>11.5.6 &nbsp; Advanced graphs</h3>
<p>Most reports only contain simple graphs such as the general-purpose ones described in this chapter. More advanced graphs are needed to effectively display some specific types of data but they are generally too complex for reports intended for the general public.</p>
<h3>11.5.7 &nbsp; Innovative graphics</h3>
<p>Some excellent graphics have been devised to display particular data sets. There is still scope for innovation.</p>
