<h1>Chapter 7 &nbsp; Basic Data Collection</h1>
<h2>7.1 &nbsp; Association &amp; causal relationships</h2>
<h3>7.1.1 &nbsp; Interest in relationships</h3>
<p>For most data sets, we are interested in understanding the relationships between the variables. However interpreting relationships must be done with care.</p>
<h3>7.1.2 &nbsp; Causal and non-causal relationships</h3>
<p>If the relationship between X and Y is causal, it is possible to predict the effect of changing the value of X.</p>
<h3>7.1.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h3>
<p>Causality can only be deduced from how the data were collected â€” the data values themselves do not contain any information about causality.</p>
<h3>7.1.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h3>
<p>In an observational study, values are passively recorded from individuals. Experiments are characterised by the experimenter's control over the values of one or more variables.</p>
<h3>7.1.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h3>
<p>Causal relationships can only be deduced from well-designed experiments.</p>
<h2>7.2 &nbsp; Sampling in practice</h2>
<h3>7.2.1 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h3>
<p>Samples are usually collected to estimate population characteristics. The ordinary variation caused by the sampling scheme is called sampling error. Practical difficulties with conducting the survey can cause biased estimates (non-sampling errors).</p>
<h3>7.2.2 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h3>
<p>Coverage error and non-response error prevent some individuals being included in the sample.</p>
<h3>7.2.3 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h3>
<p>Interviewer error and instrument error can result in 'incorrect' measurements from the sampled individuals.</p>
<h3>7.2.4 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h3>
<p>Survey information is collected by a variety of mechanisms, from mailed questionnaires to telephone. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h2>7.3 &nbsp; Simple experiments</h2>
<h3>7.3.1 &nbsp; Experiments and treatments</h3>
<p>Experiments are conducted to assess the effect of some categorical or numerical explanatory variable on a response. Experiments are characterised by the fact that the researcher can control the values of the explanatory variable that are used.</p>
<h3>7.3.2 &nbsp; Variable experimental units</h3>
<p>In many experiments, the units on which the experiment is conducted are not identical. The varying characteristics of the experimental units may affect the response.</p>
<h3>7.3.3 &nbsp; A badly designed experiment</h3>
<p>If the treatments are badly allocated to experimental units, the experiment may over- or under-estimate their effect.</p>
<h3>7.3.4 &nbsp; Confounding</h3>
<p>If the experimental units that are chosen to get one treatment also differ in other ways, it will be impossible to tell whether it is the treatment or the other distinct characteristics of the units that affects the response.</p>
<h3>7.3.5 &nbsp; Randomisation</h3>
<p>Random allocation of treatments to experimental units avoids systematic over- or under-estimation of treatment effects.</p>
<h3>7.3.6 &nbsp; Replication</h3>
<p>If each treatment is used in more than one experimental unit, unit-to-unit variability can be assessed. This gives information about whether differences between the treatments are more than chance differences.</p>
<h2>7.4 &nbsp; Practical issues in design</h2>
<h3>7.4.1 &nbsp; Purpose</h3>
<p>Why is the experiment being conducted and how will the results be used?</p>
<h3>7.4.2 &nbsp; Experimental units and measurements</h3>
<p>In an experiment, what experimental units will be used? What response variable will be recorded? Which variables will be controlled?</p>
<h3>7.4.3 &nbsp; Experiments with human subjects</h3>
<p>Other practical issues are involved when conducting experiments on human subjects.</p>
