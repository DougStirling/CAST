<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Sampling and Probability</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h3>
<p>A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h3>
<p>A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h3>
<p>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Sampling error and sample size</h3>
<p>As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>Sampling with replacement from a finite population permits the same value to be selected two or more times. Sampling without replacement ensures that there are no such duplicates.</p>
<h3>6.1.6 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h3>
<p>Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</p>
<h2>6.2 &nbsp; Sampling from a distribution</h2>
<h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; Data as representatives</h3>
<p>We often have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data are collected. The data are representative of some wider situation and we want to generalise from the data to describe features of this more general situation.</p>
<h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h3>
<p>If data collection was repeated, perhaps from different individuals, the values would be different. All such data sets should give similar but not identical information. Interpretation of a data set should take into account this randomness.</p>
<h3>6.2.3 &nbsp; Model to explain randomness</h3>
<p>Many data sets are not generated as random samples from real finite populations. However it is often useful to treat the data as a random sample from some abstract population containing the measurements that might have been recorded.</p>
<h3>6.2.4 &nbsp; Information from a sample</h3>
<p>The mechanism of sampling from a population explains randomness. Although the population is unknown and we only have a single sample, the sample provides information about the population.</p>
<h2>6.3 &nbsp; Probability &amp; probability density</h2>
<h3>6.3.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h3>
<p>When randomly selecting one value from a population of N different values, the probability of getting any individual value is 1/N. More generally, the probability of sampling a value in any range is the proportion of population values in the range.</p>
<h3>6.3.2 &nbsp; Probabilities with infinite populations</h3>
<p>The probability of any type of value is again the proportion of such values in the population. It can also be interpreted as the limiting proportion from a sample of values if the sample size is increased indefinitely.</p>
<h3>6.3.3 &nbsp; Bar charts of discrete probabilities</h3>
<p>Infinite categorical or discrete populations can be described by bar charts of the probabilities.</p>
<h3>6.3.4 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h3>
<p>Infinite continuous numerical populations are described with a type of histogram called a probability density function.</p>
<h3>6.3.5 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters, µ and σ, can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</p>
<h3>6.3.6 &nbsp; Probability and area under the pdf</h3>
<p>When a value is sampled from an infinite continuous population, the probability that it is between a and b equals the area under the p.d.f. between these two values.</p>
<h3>6.3.7 &nbsp; Properties of probability (Optional (not examined))</h3>
<p>This page describes some rules that are obeyed by probabilities.</p>
<h2>6.4 &nbsp; Probabilities from tables</h2>
<h3>6.4.1 &nbsp; Joint probabilities</h3>
<p>Bivariate categorical data are modelled as a sample from a population that consists of pairs of categorical values. The joint probability for any pair of categories is their population proportion.</p>
<h3>6.4.2 &nbsp; Marginal probabilities</h3>
<p>The marginal probabilities for a variable are the population proportions for its possible values. They can be found by summing joint probabilities.</p>
<h3>6.4.3 &nbsp; Conditional probabilities</h3>
<p>Conditional probabilites for a variable are proportions in a sub-population containing a specific value for the other variable. They are found by scaling the joint probabilities in that sub-population.</p>
<h3>6.4.4 &nbsp; Graphical display of probabilities</h3>
<p>Joint, marginal and conditional probabilities can be displayed graphically.</p>
<h3>6.4.5 &nbsp; Association</h3>
<p>Two categorical variables, X and Y, are associated (related) when the conditional distribution of Y given X=x is different for different values of x. Knowing the value of X therefore tells you something about Y.</p>
<h3>6.4.6 &nbsp; Independence</h3>
<p>When the conditional distribution of Y is the same for all values of X, the variables are called independent. This special case is of practical importance.</p>
<h2>6.5 &nbsp; Simulation (optional)</h2>
<h3>6.5.1 &nbsp; Probability models and simulation</h3>
<p>Probability can be used to model complex situations. A simulation of the model involves using the model's probabilities to generate an instance of the situation. Repeating the simulation can give insight into the behaviour of the system.</p>
<h3>6.5.2 &nbsp; Simulation: Will the best team win?</h3>
<p>A simulation demonstrates that the best team is often not top of a league at the end of the season even if it has a much higher probability of winning individual matches than all other teams.</p>
<h3>6.5.3 &nbsp; Is there evidence of skill in a league?</h3>
<p>A simulation of a soccer league shows that the spread of points at the end of an actual soccer season is not consistent with all teams having equal abilities.</p>
<h3>6.5.4 &nbsp; Assessing unusual features in data</h3>
<p>The variability of displays from 'regular' populations (such as normal distributions) can be used to assess features in a single data set, such as outliers, clusters or skewness.</p>
<h3>6.5.5 &nbsp; Random numbers</h3>
<p>Simulations are based on randomly generated values. These are generally based on random numbers for which any value between 0 and 1 is equally likely.</p>
<h3>6.5.6 &nbsp; Generating categorical values</h3>
<p>A random categorical value can be easily generated from a random number between 0 and 1.</p>
