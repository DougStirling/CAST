  <p>This chapter starts with a few simple extensions to basic graphical displays that make them more useful.</p>
  <p>Variables often have skew distributions. Extreme skewness in a variable makes its distribution hard to display but a logarithmic transformation of the values often has a much more symmetric distribution. Transformations are also often effective for linearising nonlinear relationships between two variables.</p>
  <p>The chapter ends with a section about data sets with more than two variables. A few methods are presented that give information about the relationships between the variables.</p>
