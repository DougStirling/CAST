<page dir="en/testMean" filePrefix="testMean1" summaryDir="en/testMean" summaryFilePrefix="s_testMean1" videoDir="en/testMean" videoFilePrefix="v_testMean1">For numerical populations, the null and alternative hypotheses usually specify values for the population mean. Tests are based on the sample mean.</page>
<page dir="en/testMean" filePrefix="testMean2" summaryDir="en/testMean" summaryFilePrefix="s_testMean2" videoDir="en/testMean" videoFilePrefix="v_testMean2">If the population standard deviation is known, the distribution of the sample mean can be found when the null hypothesis is true. The p-value for the test is a tail area of this distribution.</page>
<page dir="en/testMean" filePrefix="testMean_b3" summaryDir="en/testMean" summaryFilePrefix="s_testMean3" videoDir="en/testMean" videoFilePrefix="v_testMean_b3">The p-value is most easily found from the 'statistical distance' between the sample and hypothesised means. The p-value can be found as a tail area of the standard normal distribution and is approximately correct even when the population distribution is not normal.</page>
<page dir="en/testMean" filePrefix="testMean4" summaryDir="en/testMean" summaryFilePrefix="s_testMean4" videoDir="en/testMean" videoFilePrefix="v_testMean4">When the population standard deviation is unknown, a different test statistic must be used. It has a standard distribution known as a t distribution.</page>
<page dir="en/testMean" filePrefix="testMean5" summaryDir="en/testMean" summaryFilePrefix="s_testMean5" videoDir="en/testMean" videoFilePrefix="v_testMean5">The t distribution is used to obtain a p-value for tests about a population mean when the standard deviation is unknown.</page>
