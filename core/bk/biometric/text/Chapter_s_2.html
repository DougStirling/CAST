<p>Variation in data is not simply an annoyance &mdash; the variation itself can

<p class="heading notPrinted">Dot plots</p>
<p>Some ranges of values 
		are more common than others &mdash; they have higher <strong>density</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest graphical display of data that shows where there is high and low density is a <strong>dot
		plot</strong>. This shows each value as a cross (or dot) against a
		numerical axis.</p>
	<p>The gap between 3.4 and 4.9 is more obvious on the right than in a textual
list of values, whether ordered or not.</p>
</td>
<td><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_dotPlot.gif" width="72" height="324"></td>
</tr></table>




<h2 class="pageName">2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Jittering the crosses</p>
	<p>In all but the smallest data sets, the crosses on a basic dot plot overlap, making it difficult to identify regions of high density.</p>
	<p>Randomly moving crosses away from the axis reduces this problem by separating the crosses:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_jitteredDotPlot.gif" width="398" height="72"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Note that the vertical jittering is random and therefore tells you nothing about the data.</p>
	




<h2 class="pageName">2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Stacked dot plots</p>
	<p><strong>Stacking</strong> the crosses into columns is usually better than
jittering them.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stackedDotPlot.gif" alt="" width="400" height="150"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Stacking highlights regions of high density well (tall stacks).</p>
	


<h2 class="pageName">2.1.5 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h2>

<p class=heading>Digits instead of crosses</p>
	<p>Stem and leaf plots are closely related to stacked dot plots. The crosses are replaced by digits that provide a little more detail about the values that they represent.</p>
	<p class=heading>Stems and leaves</p>
	<p>In a stem and leaf plot, the axis is  replaced by a column of 'stems' &mdash; the most significant digits of the values in the data. The digits that replace the crosses are called 'leaves' and give a further significant digit of each value on a stem.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_stemLeaf.gif" alt="" width="141" height="165"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>A final refinement is to sort the leaves into increasing order on each stem.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.1.6 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h2>

<p class=heading>Need for more flexibility</p>
	<p>Sometimes basic stem and leaf plots are not flexible enough
&mdash; there would be either too many or too few rows of leaves to show the varying
density well.</p>
	<p>Repeating each stem 2 times (with leaves 0-4 on the lower copy and leaves
5-9 on the upper one) or 5 times (with leaves 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8-9 on the
different copies) gives intermediate numbers of stems.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_splitStems.gif" alt="" width="550" height="550"><br clear="all">
	</p>



<h2 class="pageName">2.1.7 &nbsp; Drawing stem and leaf plots</h2>

<p class=heading>Smoothness</p>
	<p>When drawing a stem and leaf plot, the aim is for a smooth shape to the stem
and leaf plot, and this is usually achieved by between 10 and 20 rows of leaves.</p>
	<p class=heading>Drawing by hand</p>
	<p>When data are analysed on a computer, a stacked dot plot usually describes a distribution of values more clearly than a stem and leaf plot.</p>
	<p>However stem and leaf plots are easy to draw by hand:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Decide on the stems to use &mdash; usually between 10 and 20 of them.</li>
		<li>Scan down the values identifying the leaf digits and writing them against the value's stem.</li>
		<li>Finally, sort the leaves on each stem into order.<br clear="all">
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>To simplify drawing, values are truncated to give their stems and leaf digits,
not rounded. For example, 7.98 and 7.90 would both be displayed as leaf '9' on
the stem '7'.</p>



<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.2 &nbsp; Understanding distributions</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.2.1 &nbsp; Outliers</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Outliers</p>
	<p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data are 
		called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
	<p>An outlier may have been 
		incorrectly recorded, or there may have been other anomalous circumstances
associated with it. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything
atypical can be found, outliers should be deleted from the data set and their
deletion noted in any reports about the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Outliers and skew distributions</p>
	<p>Deciding whether a value is an outlier or not is affected by the shape of
the distribution of values for the rest of the data.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Symmetric distribution</dt>
	</dl>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/outlierSymmetric.gif" width="443" height="156"> </p>
<dl>
		<dt>Skew distribution</dt>
		<dd>A distribution with a long tail to one side is called a <strong>skew</strong> distribution
&mdash; positively skew if the long tail is to the right and negatively skew if the
long tail is to the left. It  is not unusual for the extreme value in a very
skew distribution to be a  fair distance from the other values and may not be
an outlier.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/outlierSkew.gif" width="443" height="156"> </p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.2.2 &nbsp; Clusters</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>If a dot plot, stem and leaf plot or histogram separates into two or more
groups of  values (clusters), this suggests that there may be more fundamental
differences between the 'individuals' in the groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_clusters.gif" width="499" height="140"></p>
	<p>Further investigation	should be made of	the individuals in the  clusters to find whether they also differ in other ways.</p>
	<p>If the clusters were less distinct, especially in small data sets, you would need external supporting evidence before concluding that the individuals separated into meaningful groups.</p>

  


<h2 class="pageName">2.2.3 &nbsp; Distribution of values</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Distribution of values</p>
	<p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, the <strong>distribution
of values</strong>  also contains useful information. Important features
are:</p>
<ul>
		<li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
		<li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
		<li>Whether a distribution is <strong>symmetric</strong> or  <strong>skew</strong> — do the tails appear similar at both sides?</li>
		<li>Other aspects of the <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 
		concepts of centre and spread are particularly important.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.4 &nbsp; Extra information about individuals</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Extra information</p>
<p>When only a single value is known from each individual (or plant, item, etc),
all that can be discovered is the shape of the distribution of these values.</p>
<p>Additional information  about each individuals
may give insight into why some values are bigger or smaller than others. Different
types of information may be available. The simplest is a unique <strong>name</strong> for
the individuals &mdash; a textual label. These names may help us to understand why
values are outliers or group into clusters in a 
dot plot or stem and leaf plot.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.5 &nbsp; Distinguishing known groups</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Multiple groups of individuals</p>
<p>Sometimes we know that the individuals belong to two or more groups before
the data are collected or, equivalently, that they have different values of an
extra categorical variable.</p>
<p>Information about groups is best displayed by plotting the separate groups
against a common axis.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_stackedGroups.gif" width="399" height="348"></p>
<p class="heading">Back-to-back stem and leaf plots</p>
<p>Stem and leaf plots can be used to compare two groups of individuals,
if drawn on different
sides of a common column of stems. (They are less useful if there are three or
more groups.)</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/displayInterp/images/s_backToBack.gif" width="264" height="249"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.6 &nbsp; Dangers of overinterpretation</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Dangers of overinterpretation</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Features in the distribution <strong>of a small data set</strong> may not
be meaningful.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Be careful <strong>not to overinterpret</strong> patterns in small
		data sets. Clusters, outliers or skewness may appear by chance even if there is
		no meaningful basis to these features. </p>
<p>Pronounced outliers or clusters may be taken as indicative of
		something meaningful in the underlying process. However <strong>less pronounced
			outliers or clusters must be supported by outside evidence</strong> before these features
		can be interpreted as meaningful.</p>





<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.3 &nbsp; Histograms and density</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.3.1 &nbsp; Density of values</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Density</p>
	<p>In a stacked dot plot (or stem and leaf plot), the highest stacks contain the most values. These stacks have the highest <strong>density</strong> of values.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_dotPlotCanopy.gif" name="dataImage" width="445" height="220"></p>
<p>Histograms more directly show how density varies along the axis.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.2 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Histograms</p>
<p>In a simple histogram, the axis is split into sub-intervals of equal width called <strong>classes</strong>. A rectangle is drawn above each class with height equal to the number of values  in the class &mdash; the <strong>frequency</strong> of the class.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_histo.gif" width="502" height="349"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.3 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h2>

<p class="heading">Aim of a 'smooth' histogram</p>
	<p>There is considerable freedom in the choice of histogram classes. The exact
shape depends on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Class width</li>
		<li>Start value for first class</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We usually choose classes with the aim of <strong>smoothness</strong> in the outline 
		of the histogram rectangles.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_classWidths.gif" width="368" height="360"></p>
	<p>The choice of 'best' classes is subjective, but...</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If your conclusions about what a histogram tells you about the data  depend on the choice of histogram classes, you are over-interpreting its shape.</p>
	</div></div>

	


<h2 class="pageName">2.3.4 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h2>

<p class="heading">Warning for small data sets</p>
	<p>For small data sets, changing the class width and the starting position for
the first class can give a <strong>surprising amount of variability in histogram
shape</strong>, so be extremely wary of over-interpreting features  such as
clusters or skewness.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is probably better to avoid using histograms unless there is a reasonable number of values &mdash; stacked dot plots are far less likely to mislead you over minor features.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.5 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h2>

<p class="heading">Relative frequency</p>
	<p>When all histogram classes are of equal width, histograms are often drawn 
		with a vertical axis giving the frequencies (counts) for each class. The vertical axis can alternatively be labelled with the <strong>relative frequencies</strong> (proportions) for the classes.</p>
	<p>(There is no harm in including both axes.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_relFreqHisto.gif" width="420" height="236"></p>
	<p class="heading">Area equals relative frequency</p>
	<p>An important property of histograms is that the proportion of values in one or more classes equals the proportion of the histogram area above these classes.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_area.gif" width="455" height="289"> </p>
	<p>Therefore,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Relative frequency = proportion of the total 
			area</p>
	</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.6 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Relative frequencies to compare two groups</p>
	<p>Histograms may be superimposed to compare two groups. However if the groups
differ in size,  it is usually more meaningful to compare relative frequencies
(proportions) than the counts in the classes.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Use <strong>relative frequency</strong> histograms to compare groups.</p>
</div></div>
	<p>For example,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_histoGroups.gif" width="456" height="461"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.7 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Mixed class widths</p>
<p>For some data sets, wider classes give a smoother histogram in some ranges of values (e.g. in the tail of a distribution) and narrower classes are better in other parts of the distribution (usually where there is greater density of values).</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p> In a correctly drawn histogram, each value contributes the same area. </p>
</div></div>
<p>Histograms can be drawn with mixed class widths, but it would be <strong>badly misleading</strong> to make the rectangle heights equal to either the class frequency or relative frequency.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_mixedClasses.gif" width="504" height="431"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.8 &nbsp; Understanding histograms</h2>

<p class="heading">Area and proportion of values</p>
<p>The details of drawing histograms by hand with varying class widths are unimportant
&mdash; a computer should be used. To interpret
their shape remember that</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>The proportion of the total area above any classes
equals the proportion of values in them.</p></div></div>
<p>For example,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_mixedProbs.gif" width="456" height="292"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.3.9 &nbsp; Frequency polygons</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Frequency polygons</p>
<p>A <strong>frequency polygon</strong> is closely related to a histogram with equal class widths. It joins the midpoints of the tops of the class rectangles and tends to give a smoother outline than the corresponding histogram.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_freqPoly.gif" width="448" height="237"></p>
<p>It is easier to distinguish and compare superimposed frequency polygons for two groups than the corresponding histograms.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_freqPoly2.gif" width="449" height="206"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.3.10 &nbsp; Kernel density estimates ((optional))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Kernel density estimates</p>
<p>A <strong>kernel density estimate</strong> is an alternative to a histogram that often results in a smoother display of the density of values. Each data value on the axis is replaced by a 'blob' of ink (kernel) and these kernels are stacked.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/density/images/s_kernel.gif" width="349" height="263"></p>
<p>The widths of the kernels can be adjusted &mdash; if they are too narrow, the display becomes jagged, but if they are too wide, the display becomes too spread out and detail is lost.</p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.3.11 &nbsp; Drawing histograms by hand ((optional))</h2>

<p class="heading">Frequency table</p>
<p>A computer is normally used to draw histograms. Hand-drawn histograms are
based on a <strong>frequency table</strong> that lists the histogram classes
and their frequencies.</p>
<p>To avoid ambiguity in the histogram, the class boundaries should be chosen to ensure that no data values are on boundaries. For example,</p>
<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/freqTable2.gif" width="280" height="150"></div>
<p class=heading>Height of a histogram rectangle</p>
<p>To draw a histogram by hand with equal class widths, each class rectangle
can be drawn with height equal to its class frequency. If class widths vary,
we need to calculate the <strong>density</strong> for each class with the formula:</p>
<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/density/images/densityDefn.gif" width="284" height="39"> </p>
<p>and use this for the rectangle heights.</p>





<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.4 &nbsp; Median, quartiles &amp; box plots</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.4.1 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h2>

<p class="heading">Unhelpful detail when comparing groups</p>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain a lot of detail about
the distribution of values in a data set. This level of detail is useful when
examining a single data set, but when several groups of values are being compared,
the detail distracts from the main differences between the groups.</p>
<p>For example, the jittered dot plots below do not concisely summarise the differences
between the five groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_jitteredGroups.gif" width="413" height="224"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.4.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h2>

<p class="heading">Five-number summary</p>
<p>Five values are enough to capture a lot of information about the distribution of values in a data set.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The two <strong>extremes</strong>  (i.e. the minimum and maximum values).</li>
	<li>The <strong>lower quartile</strong>, <strong>median</strong> and <strong>upper quartile</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These values split the data set into four groups with approximately equal numbers of values.</p>
<p class="heading">Box plot</p>
<p>A box plot displays the five-number summary graphically.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_boxPlotDefn.gif" width="445" height="225"></p>
<p class="heading">Details</p>
<p>The median, <em>m</em>, is the middle value if there is an odd number of values in the data set. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two.</p>
<p>Different authors give slightly different definitions for the upper and lower
quartiles. One definition of the lower quartile is the median of the lowest half
of the data &mdash; i.e. of the values lower than <em>m</em>. (The upper quartile
would then be defined as the median of the top half of the values.)</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Provided you are consistent, different definitions of the quartiles  should lead you to the same conclusions.</p>
</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">2.4.3 &nbsp; Interpreting a box plot's shape</h2>

<p class="heading">Box plots and histograms</p>
	<p>Since the median and quartiles split the data set into quartiles, they also  split a histogram of the data into four approximately equal areas.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">2.4.6 &nbsp; Comparison of groups</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Box plots to compare groups</p>
	<p>To display the distribution of values in a single set of data, a dot plot
or histogram is more useful than a box plot. However for comparison of <strong>two
or more groups</strong> of values box plots are particularly effective &mdash; they
highlight differences between the centres, spreads of values and skewness of
the groups.</p>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Stability of the shape of box plots</p>

		<dd>The <strong>range</strong> (maximum - minimum) and <strong>interquartile

	</dl>
	<p class=heading>Information from median and interquartile range</p>
	<p>Given the median and interquartile range, it is possible to sketch a bell-shaped 
		histogram that matches these values. Such a 'guess' is often close to the

	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/iqrAndHisto.gif" width="424" height="223"></p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.5.3 &nbsp; Summaries of centre</h2>

<p class=heading>Median</p>
	<p>Half of the data values are below the median and half are above it:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/medianProperties.gif" width="500" height="140"></p>
	<p class=heading>Mean</p>
	<p>The mean  is: </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/meanEqn.gif" width="70" height="35"> </p>
	<p>If each value in a dot plot was a solid object resting on a beam with negligible mass, the mean is the value at which the beam will balance.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_balance.gif" width="451" height="139"></p>
	<p>Because of the leverage exerted by points far from the centre, the mean is further into the tail of a skew distribution than you might expect.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.5.4 &nbsp; Properties of median and mean</h2>

<p>Although both describe aspects of the 'centre' of a distribution, the median and mean are 
		not the same and can occasionally have very different values.</p>
	<p class=heading>Social vs economic indicator</p>
	<p>For some data sets, <strong>the median can be considered to be a social indicator,
		whereas the mean can be interpreted as an economic indicator</strong>. In a company,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the median salary indicates what the 'average employee' earns
			(half of the employees earn more and half earn less)</li>
		<li>the mean salary reflects the total amount paid as salaries in the company
			(it is <em>total</em>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<em>n</em>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Outliers</p>
	<p>An outlier has little effect on the  median,
		but affects the mean more strongly. The median is
		said to be more <strong>robust</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Skew distributions</p>
	<p>When a distribution  is fairly symmetrical, the mean and median
		are similar, but if the distribution is skew, then the mean is usually further
into the tail of the distribution than the median.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_meanMedian.gif" width="452" height="143"> </p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.5.5 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>Range</dt>
		<dd>Difference between maximum and minimum values</dd>
		<dt>Inter-quartile range</dt>
		<dd>The middle half of the values are within an interval of this length</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>These are (relatively) easy to understand and explain to others, but neither are commonly used.</p>
	<p class="heading">Standard deviation</p>
	<p>The standard deviation is a 'typical' distance of values from the sample mean.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations.gif" width="434" height="166"> </p>
	<p>The  standard deviation  is denoted by the letter <span class="black em">s</span>  and
is defined by:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/sdDefn.gif" width="115" height="52"></p>
	<p>The numerator, <span class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/ssqDevns.gif" width="70" height="26"></span>, depends on the distances of the values to the mean, so it will be small if the values are all close to the mean and big if they are far from the mean.</p>
	<p class="heading">Variance</p>
	<p>The square of the standard deviation, <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, is called the
sample <strong>variance</strong>. Variances are sometimes reported and used but
standard deviations are easier to interpret since they have  the same units as
the original data (e.g. kilograms or dollars).</p>

 


<h2 class="pageName">2.5.6 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h2>

<p class="heading">'Quarter-range' rule of thumb</p>
	<p>For many data sets, the standard deviation is just under 
		a quarter of the range.</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations2.gif" width="454" height="158"></td>
	</tr>
</table></div>

	<p>This is a simple rule, but is only very approximate. The standard deviation 
		can be more than a quarter the range in distributions with short tails or 
		much less if there are long tails or outliers.</p>
	<p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb</p>
	<p>The <strong>70-95-100 rule</strong> is more accurate. In many distributions, </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Approximately 70% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
		<li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
		<li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule holds approximately for most reasonably symmetric data 
		sets, but for skew data or distributions with long tails, outliers or clusters, it is often less accurate.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.5.7 &nbsp; Understanding means and st devns</h2>

<p>Understanding the
		definition of the standard deviation is much less important than knowing
its properties and having a feel for what its numerical value tells you about
the data. </p>
	<p class="heading">Guessing <em>s</em> from histogram</p>
<p>About 95% of the values should 
		be within 2<em>s</em> of the mean, so after dropping the top 2.5% 
		and bottom 2.5% of the values (histogram area), the remainder should 
		span approximately 4<em>s</em>. Dividing this range by 4 should 
		approximate the standard deviation.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/guessSD.gif" width="288" height="154"> </p>
	<p class="heading">Sketching a histogram from the mean and <em>s</em></p>
<p>Similarly, you should 
		be able to draw a rough sketch of a symmetric histogram with any mean and
standard deviation that you are given. (It would be centred on the mean and 95%
of the area would be within 2<em>s</em> of this.)</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.5.8 &nbsp; Warnings about mean &amp; st devn</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">The shape of a distribution</p>
<div class="boxed"><p>The mean and standard deviation hold <strong>no information about the shape</strong> of a distribution, other than its centre and spread.</p></div>

	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_anscombe.gif" width="399" height="435"> </p>
	<p>Clusters, outliers and skewness are important features of a data set and should influence the analysis

<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.6 &nbsp; More about variation (optional)</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.6.1 &nbsp; Effect of outliers</h2>

<p class="heading">Outliers and the standard deviation</p>
	<p>The mean and standard deviation  are  inadequate descriptions 
		of distributions that have clusters, outliers or skewness.</p>
	<p>An outlier has a  strong influence on the mean of the 
		data and an even bigger effect on the standard deviation. In the data below, one measurement was missing and coded as '999'. If this value (999) is included, the mean is a feasible value, but the standard deviation should be recognised as being unreasonable.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/moreVariation/images/s_outlier.gif" width="500" height="277"></p>
	<p>A graphical display such as a dot plot is the best way to detect an outlier and you should <strong>always look at the data</strong> before summarising with a mean and standard deviation.</p>
	<p>An outlier should be carefully examined. Was the value incorrectly recorded? Was there something unusual about the individual from which the measurement was obtained? If we are convinced that there was something wrong about the value, it should be removed from the data set before further analysis.</p>
	



<h2 class="pageName">2.6.2 &nbsp; Standard deviation of grouped data</h2>

<p class="heading">Within-group and overall standard deviation</p>
	<p>In some data sets, the 'individuals' can be split into groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/moreVariation/images/s_groups.gif" width="499" height="351"></p>
	<p>When the three groups above (A, B and C) are combined,  all information about
the differences between the groups is lost. The overall variability
is also considerably larger than variability within the groups.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>The standard deviation of the combined data 
				set is often considerably higher than that of the separate groups.</p></div>

	<p>It is therefore better to separately describe the distributions within the

<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/transform/images/s_linear.gif" width="454" height="180"></p>
<p class="heading">Centre and spread</p>
<p>The centre and spread of the data are different, but the shape of the distribution
otherwise remains unchanged. The mean and standard deviation are related:</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><strong>new mean</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>a</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em> &nbsp;&times &nbsp;<strong>old mean</strong></span></p>
<p class=eqn> <span class="black"><strong>new sd</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp;<em><font size="+1">|</font>b<font size="+1">|</font></em> &nbsp;&times &nbsp;<strong>old sd</strong></span> </p>
<p>Note that if the scale factor, b, is negative, we must change its sign since
 the standard deviation must always be positive.</p>
<p>Most other measures of centre (e.g. the median) and spread (e.g. the interquartile
range) are similarly related.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.8.2 &nbsp; Log transformations</h2>

<p class="heading">Nonlinear transformations</p>
	<p>Nonlinear transformations arise when the values are replaced by a nonlinear function of the original measurements, such as their logarithm or inverse. They  have a more fundamental effect on
	the shape of a distribution than linear transformations. </p>
	<p>The most commonly used nonlinear transformation is:</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><strong>new value</strong> &nbsp; = log<sub>10</sub> <font size="+1">(</font><strong>old value</strong><font size="+1">)</font></span> </p>
	<p>Natural logarithms (base <em>e</em>) have a similar effect on the distribution
of values but base-10 logarithms are easier to interpret so we use them here.</p>
<p class="heading">Properties of logarithms</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Multiplying any value by 10 increases its logarithm by 1.</li>
		<li>Doubling any value increases its logarithm by log<sub>10</sub>(2) = 0.3010.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider four values 1, 10, 100 and 1000. The first two values are much closer 
		to each other than the last two values. However their logarithms are 0, 1, 
		2 and 3, so their logarithms are evenly spaced out.</p>
	<p class="heading">Effect on the shape of a distribution</p>
	<p>A logarithmic transformation selectively spreads out low values 
		in a distribution and compresses high values. It is therefore useful before
analysing skew data with a long tail towards the high values. It will spread
out a dense cluster of low values and may detect clustering or outliers that
would not be visible in graphical displays of the original data.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/transform/images/s_log.gif" width="499" height="236"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.8.3 &nbsp; When to use log transform?</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">'Quantities'</p>
	<p>Logarithmic transformation can only be used for data sets consisting of positive
 values &mdash; logarithms are undefined for negative or zero values. They are therefore
particularly useful for <strong>quantities</strong> &mdash; 
		i.e. amounts of something. Indeed, many researchers <strong>routinely</strong> apply
logarithmic transformation  to quantity data before analysis.</p>
<p class="heading notPrinted">When are they effective?</p>
	<p>A log transformation affects the shape of the distribution most when the
ratio of the largest to the smallest value in the data is large. When this ratio
is less than 10 (one <strong>order of magnitude</strong>) then the transformation
has much less influence on the shape of the distribution, as in the data set
below.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/transform/images/s_log2.gif" width="499" height="272"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.8.4 &nbsp; Power transformations ((advanced))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Power transformations</p>
	<p>A more general family of transformations that is flexible enough to  reduce
or eliminate the skewness in a wide range of data sets is:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/transform/images/boxCoxEqn.gif" width="409" height="106"> </p>
	<p>This family of <strong>power transformations</strong> includes many common ones:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/transform/images/powerTable.gif" width="363" height="254"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.8.5 &nbsp; Power transforms &amp; skewness</h2>

<p class="heading">Effect of power transformations</p>
<p>Power transformations affect the skewness of data.</p>
<p>If a power transformation with <em>p</em> &gt; 1 is applied to data with a
symmetric distribution, it will make the data skew with a long right tail. If
the power transformation has <em>p</em> &lt; 1, the distribution will become one
with a long left tail.</p>
<p>In practice, power transformations are used to do the opposite. They can change many skewness distributions into fairly symmetric ones.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.9 &nbsp; Discrete data (counts)</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.9.1 &nbsp; Discrete and continuous data</h2>

<p>It is important to distinguish  two types of numerical data. </p>
<dl>
	<dt>Discrete data</dt>
	<dd>When the values in the batch are whole numbers (<strong>counts</strong>), 
		the data set is called <strong>discrete</strong>.		</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Continuous data</dt>
	<dd>When the data are not constrained to be whole numbers, the data set is 
		called <strong>continuous</strong>.		</dd>
</dl>
<p class=heading>Dot plots for counts</p>
<p>Dot plots can be used to display count data. However since discrete values
are often repeated several times in a data set, the crosses need to be jittered
or, preferably, stacked.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/counts/images/s_stackedDots.gif" width="499" height="102"></p>
<p>If there is a stack for each integer value, the stacked dot plot is a complete representation of the data.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.9.2 &nbsp; Histograms for counts</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Displaying moderate or large counts</p>
	<p>For discrete data sets whose values are large counts, a histogram can be
used to give a 'smooth' summary of the shape of the distribution of values.</p>
	<p>If the counts are a bit smaller, the exact definition of the histogram classes becomes important. The class boundaries should end in '.5' to ensure that data values 
		do not occur on the boundary of two classes.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/counts/images/s_histo.gif" width="503" height="309"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.9.3 &nbsp; Bar charts</h2>

<p class="heading">Displaying small counts</p>
	<p>When the range of values in a discrete data set is small, a histogram can be drawn with class width 1 (and with class boundaries ending in '.5'). These classes are <strong>centred 
		</strong>on  1, 2, 3, etc. </p>
	<p>This can be improved by narrowing the histogram rectangles into bars to emphasise
the discrete nature of the data. This is called a <strong> bar chart</strong>.
