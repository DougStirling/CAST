<p class="heading notPrinted">Time series data</p>
	<p>Data sets whose measurements  are made sequentially at regular 
		intervals are called <strong>time series</strong>. We often want to forecast
future values of a time series.</p>
<p class="heading">The importance of plotting</p>
	<p>As with other data structures, the information 
		in a time series is most easily understood from a <strong>graphical</strong> display.
A <strong>time series plot</strong> is a type of scatterplot whose horizontal
axis shows the time-ordering of the values. Successive crosses are often  joined
by lines.</p>

<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">4.2 &nbsp; Smoothing</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">4.2.1 &nbsp; Moving averages</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Smoothing</p>
	<p>Random fluctuations in a time series are usually <strong>noise</strong> that  can obscure trend and other <strong>signal</strong> in the series. The values can be <strong>smoothed</strong> to reduce these random fluctuations and show 
	the systematic movement in the series more clearly.</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><strong>smoothed value</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp;<em><strong>centre</strong></em> ( <strong>original value</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>adjacent values</strong> )</span> </p>
	<p class="heading">Moving averages</p>
	<p>A <strong>3-point moving average</strong> replaces the value at time <i>i</i> by </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/runningMeanEqn.gif" width="210" height="25"> </p>
	<p>Moving 
		averages are also called <strong>running means</strong>. In the example below,
a 7-point moving average replaces each value with the mean of it and the 3 adjacent
 values on each side.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/smoothing/images/s_movingAverage.gif" width="501" height="249"></p>
	<p>The more adjacent values used, the greater the smoothing.</p>
	<p class="heading">Ends of the series</p>
	<p>Note that moving averages cannot be used to smooth the values at the two ends of the time series.</p>
	



<h2 class="pageName">4.2.2 &nbsp; More about moving averages</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Moving average with odd and even run lengths</p>
	<p>A moving average provides a smoothed value at the middle of the times of the values being averaged.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/movingAverage5.gif" width="249" height="218">          <img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/movingAverage4.gif" width="237" height="218"></p>
	<p>If averaging over an even number of values, the smoothed value is for a time between those of the data values, such as &quot;year 2005.5&quot;.</p>
	<p class="heading">A second stage of averaging for even run lengths</p>
	<p>To provide smoothed values at the same times as the raw data, we often take a further 2-point moving average.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/movingAverageDouble.gif" width="428" height="218"> </p>
	<p>This is equivalent to giving <strong>half weight</strong> to the two outermost values. If  based on moving averages of 4, this is called a 4-point centred moving average.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>These centred averages are particularly useful when analysing seasonal data. For example, 12-point centred moving averages are often used for monthly data.</p>
	</div></div>
	



<h2 class="pageName">4.2.3 &nbsp; Robust smoothing ((optional))</h2>

<p class="heading">Outliers and running medians</p>
	<p>Since medians are less sensitive to outliers than means, a more robust alternative to running means replaces each value by the <strong>median</strong> of it and adjacent values. A <strong>3-point running median</strong> is: </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/runningMedianEqn.gif" width="225" height="25"> </p>
	<p>and higher-order running medians will use more adjacent values. </p>
	<p class="heading">Comparison of means and medians</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Moving averages are more affected by outliers in the series</li>
		<li>Running medians often have a 'stepped' appearance &mdash; the smoothed series 
			is level for periods, followed by relatively sharp jumps.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/smoothing/images/s_meanMedian.gif" width="539" height="283"></p>
<p class=heading>Running medians, followed by moving averages</p>
<p>To take advantage of the best features of both moving averages and running 
		medians, these two techniques are often applied sequentially.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Firstly, low-order running medians are used to remove the influence of outliers.</li>
		<li>The resulting series is then further smoothed with low-order moving averages.</li>
	</ul>




<h2 class="pageName">4.2.4 &nbsp; Exponential smoothing</h2>

<p class="heading">Smoothing up to the end of the series</p>
	<p>We are usually most interested in the  latest values in a time
series, but moving averages  cannot provide smoothed values at the two ends of
the time series. <strong>Exponential 
smoothing</strong> works up to the end of the series:</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expSmoothInitial.gif" width="59" height="18"> </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expSmoothEqn.gif" width="175" height="25"></p>
	<p>where the smoothing constant, <i>a</i>, is a value between 0 and 1. The smoothed
value is a 'weighted average' of the actual value at that time and the previous
smoothed value.</p>
<p class="heading">Alternative formula</p>
	<p>The formula can also be expressed as </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expSmoothEqn2.gif" width="486" height="26"></p>
	<p>For example, if <em>a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2 </sub>, </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expSmoothHalf.gif" width="299" height="26"> </p>
	<p>The smoothed value puts more weight on the recent past (which is an intuitively sensible thing to do).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The closer <em>a</em> becomes to one, the greater the influence of the
actual value, and the less smoothing.</li>
		<li>The closer <em>a</em> becomes to zero, the more smoothing.</li>
</ul>
	<p class="heading">Forecasting future values</p>
	<p>If the most recent value is at time <em>i</em>, we forecast
the value at time <em>i</em> + <em>k</em> to be the last exponentially smoothed
value,</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expPredict.gif" width="252" height="23"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>If <i>a</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the forecast is just the last observed value 
			in the time series.</li>
		<li>As <i>a</i> is reduced, the forecast becomes more affected by earlier 
			values in the series.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="heading">Time series with trend</p>
	<p>If the time 
		series has an increasing trend, exponential smoothing will 
		tend to underestimate the trend. Similarly, the smoothed series will be too high if 
		there is a decreasing trend.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/smoothing/images/s_expSmoothTrend.gif" width="455" height="258"></p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Do not use exponential smoothing on a time series with trend.</p>
	</div></div>
	


<h2 class="pageName">4.2.5 &nbsp; Lowess smoothing of time series ((advanced))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Least squares smoothing of adjacent values</p>
	<p>Another method that  provides smoothed values up to both ends of a time series is called <strong>lowess</strong> (<strong>lo</strong>cally <strong>we</strong>ighted <strong>s</strong>catterplot <strong>s</strong>moothing). When used with time series, it is similar to running means except that instead of using the average of values at adjacent times, it fits a least squares line through them and uses this least squares line to estimate the smoothed value.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/lowessEqn.gif" width="309" height="21"></p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/smoothing/images/s_lowess.gif" width="513" height="272"></p>
	<p>The number of adjacent points used for each smoothed value can be adjusted. As this 'window' becomes wider, the values are smoothed more, but if it is too wide, detail is lost.</p>
	<p>Since a separate least squares line must be fitted to obtain each smoothed value, a computer must be used to apply this method.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.2.6 &nbsp; Lowess smoothing of scatterplots ((advanced))</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Local smoothing of scatterplots</p>
	<p>Lowess can be used to smooth time series but was originally developed as a general way to draw a smooth curve on any type of scatterplot. Again, the smoothed value for any observation is obtained by fitting a least squares line to the observations with adjacent values for the explanatory variable. The fitted values that are obtained in this way are joined with lines.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/smoothing/images/s_lowessScatter.gif" width="513" height="266"></p>
	<p>(Most computer software implements a version of lowess that is  a actually bit more complex than has been described here but our simpler version gives a good flavour of the method.)</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">4.3 &nbsp; Long-term trend</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">4.3.1 &nbsp; Linear trend</h2>

<p class="heading">Least squares</p>
	<p>Moving averages provide a good <strong>description</strong> of the trend
 in a time series but are less useful for <strong>forecasting</strong> future
values. For forecasting, it is better to describe trend  with a mathematical
equation,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>trend</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; function (<em> time</em> )</span> </p>
	<p>The simplest such model is a <strong>linear model</strong>,</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>trend</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>1</sub><em> time</em></span> </p>
	<p><em>b</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> can be estimated by <strong>least squares</strong> to
minimise</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/trend/images/rss.gif" width="233" height="26"> </p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/trend/images/s_linear.gif" width="456" height="311"></p>
	<p class="heading">Recoding the years</p>
	<p>The large intercept in the example above is avoided if the years are recoded
 so that
some year within the range of the data becomes &quot;year 0&quot;.</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>trend</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>1</sub> <font size="+1">(</font><em>time</em> &minus; 1960<font size="+1">)</font></span> </p>
	<p>This model is equivalent and gives the same fitted values and 
		forecasts. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/trend/images/s_linearRecoded.gif" width="456" height="311"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.3.2 &nbsp; Quadratic trend</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Quadratic models</p>
	<p>If the trend in a time series is nonlinear, a linear model should not be
used. A simple model that can explain some simple types of curvature is a <strong>quadratic
model</strong>:</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>trend</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>1</sub><em> time</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>2</sub><em> time</em><sup>2</sup></span> </p>
	<p>This has <strong>three</strong> parameters that 
		can be adjusted to improve the fit of the model. Residuals
 are again defined as</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>e<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>y<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<em>trend<sub>i</sub></em></span> </p>
	<p>and the <strong>least squares</strong> estimates of <em>b</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>
and <em>b</em><sub>2</sub>  are
the values that minimise the residual sum of squares,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><font size="+1">&Sigma;</font> <em>e<sub>i</sub></em><sup>2</sup></span> </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/trend/images/s_quadratic.gif" width="507" height="315"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.3.3 &nbsp; Forecasting</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Using linear and quadratic models for forecasting</p>
	<p>After fitting a linear or quadratic model by least squares, forecasting 
		is simply a matter of inserting future time values into its equation.</p>
	<p class="heading">Dangers in forecasting</p>
	<p>It is important to realise that the forecasts from linear or quadratic models
are highly dependent on the type of line or curve that is chosen for modelling.
The dangers are the same as those for extrapolation in bivariate relationships.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Beware forecasting many time periods into the future &mdash; the 
				shape of the actual trend line might be different from your model.</p>
</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">4.3.4 &nbsp; Polynomial trend</h2>

<p class="heading">Cubic and higher-degree polynomial models</p>
	<p>If a quadratic model does not adequately describe the shape of the trend in a time series, it is tempting to try to further increase the order of the polynomial,</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>trend</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>1</sub><em> time</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>2</sub><em> time</em><sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>3</sub><em> time</em><sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;...</span> </p>
	<p>This kind of polynomial model  can also be fitted by least squares.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/trend/images/s_polynomial.gif" width="550" height="327"></p>
	<p>A polynomial of degree 3 or 4 often provides a fairly smooth description
of trend but polynomial models usually behave badly (with sudden increases or
decreases) beyond the data points, so...</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Polynomial models of degree greater than 2 should not be used for forecasting.</p>
	</div></div>

	



<h2 class="pageName">4.3.5 &nbsp; Detrending a time series</h2>

<p class="heading">Residuals</p>
	<p>The residuals for a time series model subtract the trend from the values
and are called the <strong>detrended</strong> values,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>e<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>y<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<em>trend<sub>i</sub></em></span> </p>
	<p>If the model under consideration fits well, there should be no 
		pattern in the residuals &mdash; each should have the same chance of being positive 
		or negative.</p>
