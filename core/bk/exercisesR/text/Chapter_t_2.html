<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Two Numerical Variables</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Scatterplots and correlation</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Information from scatterplots</h3>
<p>This exercise expects you to interpret four scatterplots in terms of the relationship between the variables, clusters and outliers. Scatterplots of the data sets must be produced in an external statistics program.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Correlation coefficient, r</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will use an external statistical program to find the correlation coefficient between two variables.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Least squares</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; Slope and intercept</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to find the equation of the least squares line describing the relationship between two variables</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Interpreting the slope and intercept</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you are asked to select one of four statements that correctly describes the slope or intercept of a least squares line in the context of the data.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Predictions</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page describes a data set. You should find the least squares line and use it to predict the response, given a value for the explanatory variable.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Curvature, outliers and leverage</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; Regression problems</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to identify the difficulties with using the least squares line to predict Y at a given X from the data in a scatterplot (an outlier, curvature, a high-leverage point or extrapolation).</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Log transformations of X and Y</h3>
<p>You are asked whether a logarithmic transformation of X or Y might linearise the data in a scatterplot (and also give constant variability).</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Prediction from nonlinear model</h3>
<p>In this exercise, a least squares line is fitted to a model that involves log(X) and/or log(Y). You are asked to use the equation of the line to predict Y from X.</p>
