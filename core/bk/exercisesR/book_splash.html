<p class="heading">Important statistical skills</p>

<p>Statistical methods are always used in the context of a problem in some applied 
discipline such as medicine, business, economics, ecology, etc. Important skills 
are: </p>

<ul>
<li>collection of information that is relevant to the problem,</li>
<li>selection of an appropriate way to analyse the data, and</li>
<li>using the results of the analysis to answer questions in the context and terminology 
of the application area.</li>
</ul>

<p>A further practical skill that is important to statisticians is  gaining expertise in <strong>using a statistical program to analyse data</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Exercises involving external analysis of data</p>
<p>In practice, statisticians must use a statistical program to analyse data. The exercises in this e-book involve exporting data from CAST and performing some analysis in such a program. The data are exported in CSV format that can be imported into most statistical programs.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>These exercises both help to reinforce statistical concepts and give practice with using a statistical program to analyse data.</p>
