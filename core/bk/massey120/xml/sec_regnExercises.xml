<page dir="en/regnModel" filePrefix="e_regnModel1">The exercise on this page gives a normal linear regression model and asks for the distribution of the response at a fixed value of the explanatory variable.</page>
<page dir="en/regnEst" filePrefix="e_regnEst1">Any estimator's standard error gives information about its accuracy. The exercise on this page gives the standard error of a least squares line's slope and asks for a roughly calculated interval that is likely to include the underlying model's slope. (T values are not required in this exercise.)</page>
<page dir="en/regnEst" filePrefix="e_regnEst2">In the two exercises on this page, confidence intervals for a regression model's slope should be calculated from the least squares slope and its standard error. The second exercise is a little harder -- it asks for various confidence levels.</page>
<page dir="en/regnEst" filePrefix="e_regnEst3">This exercise asks for the characteristics of a data set that will result in more accurate estimation of the linear model's slope.</page>
<page dir="en/regnTest" filePrefix="e_regnTest1">This exercise gives the least squares slope and its standard error. The p-value for testing whether the regression slope is zero should be calculated and interpreted.</page>
