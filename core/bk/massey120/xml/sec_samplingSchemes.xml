<page dir="en/sampPractice" filePrefix="sampPractice1" summaryDir="en/sampPractice" summaryFilePrefix="s_sampPractice1" videoDir="en/sampPractice" videoFilePrefix="v_sampPractice1">More accurate estimates can sometimes be obtained by taking separate random samples within different parts of the population.</page>
<page dir="en/sampPractice" filePrefix="sampPractice2" summaryDir="en/sampPractice" summaryFilePrefix="s_sampPractice2" videoDir="en/sampPractice" videoFilePrefix="v_sampPractice2">When individuals are grouped in clusters, it is often cheaper to sample complete clusters rather than separate individuals.</page>
<page dir="en/sampPractice" filePrefix="sampPractice3" summaryDir="en/sampPractice" summaryFilePrefix="s_sampPractice3" videoDir="en/sampPractice" videoFilePrefix="v_sampPractice3">When the target population is spread over a wide area, it may be cheaper to take a sample from only a few regions (groups of individuals), than to sample from all the regions.</page>
