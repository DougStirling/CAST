<p class="heading">Proportions within groups</p>
<p>Although a contingency table fully describes categorical data from two or more
groups, it is a poor way to compare the distributions if there are different total
numbers in the groups.</p>
<p>Rather than tabulating the frequencies for each group, it is more informative
to tabulate the <strong>proportions within the groups</strong>. Each frequency in
the table is therefore divided by the <strong>total for that group</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, in the health and contraception data on the previous page,</p>
<ul>
<li>12 of the women aged 16-29 who did not use contraception did so because they
wanted to become pregnant, but</li>
<li>28 of those aged 30-39 gave this as their reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>However since there were many more in the 30-39 age group, it is more meaningful
to report that</p>
<ul>
<li>a proportion <sup>12</sup>/<sub>57</sub> = 0.21 of those aged 16-29 did so to
become pregnant, whereas</li>
<li>only <sup>28</sup>/<sub>166</sub> = 0.17 of those aged 30-39 gave this as their
reason.</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Blood type and race</p>

<p>In a study of racial differences in blood types, blood specimens from the Blood 
Bank of Hawaii were classified by blood type (O, A, B and AB) and by ethnic group 
(Hawaiian, Hawaiian-white, Hawaiian-Chinese and White). The contingency table 
below describes the data.</p>

<p>Differences between the ethnic groups are clearer if the <strong>proportions</strong> 
of each blood type are displayed within each ethnic group. These proportions are 
found by dividing each row of the table by its row total &mdash; <strong>click on any 
row</strong> to see the process.</p>
<p>Select the option <strong>Propn within Ethnic group</strong> from the pop-up 
menu to display the resulting proportions. This scales each row, making all row 
totals the same, 1.0.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>Observe that a larger proportion of 
							Hawaiian-chinese and Whites have blood types B and AB than the other 
							ethnic groups.
</p></div></div>
<p>Multiplying the proportions by 100 rewrites them as percentages. Select 
			<strong>Percent within Ethnic group</strong> to display these percentages. 
			Although percentages and proportions contain the same information, the leading 
			zeros and decimal points are absent in the percentages and this 'cleaner' 
			display makes it easier to compare the ethnic groups.</p>
