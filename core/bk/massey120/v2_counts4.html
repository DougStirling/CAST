<p class=heading>Frequency table</p>

  <p>Bar charts and pie charts for discrete data are based on the <strong>frequencies</strong> 
		of the different values &mdash; i.e. the number of times each value occurs in the 
		data set. </p>

<p>In data sets with a small number of possible counts (say 20 or fewer), a 
		frequency table is a useful summary in its own right. Unlike frequency tables 
		for continuous data, no grouping is involved so no information is lost.</p>
	<p class=heading>Calculating the mean from a frequency table</p>

  <p>The mean of a discrete data set can be easily calculated from a frequency 
		table.</p>
		
<div class="diagram">

	<p>The following frequency table describes the household sizes in a sample of 
		600 households.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'counts', 'meanCalc', '506', '458');</script>

<p>Note that the summation in the formula is over the distinct values in the data set, rather than 
		all individuals.</p>
	
	
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Note that the mean number of individuals per household is not 
				a whole number. This is perfectly reasonable for the mean of a discrete 
				variable.</p>
	</div></div>

	</div>
	
	
	<p class=heading>Using a spreadsheet (Optional)</p>
	<p>The above calculation can be easily performed on a spreadsheet. The diagram 
		below indicates how this may be done using Microsoft Excel.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'counts', 'excel', '394', '194');</script>

	<p class=heading>Calculating the standard deviation</p>
	<p>A similar simplification holds for the standard deviation of a discrete data 
		set, making use of the formula</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../en/counts/images/ssqEqn.gif" width="307" height="41"></p>
	<p>Note that the summation on the left would be over all 600 households, whereas 
		the summation on the right is only over the 7 distinct household sizes.</p>
	<p>A spreadsheet is again a convenient way to perform the calculations.</p>
