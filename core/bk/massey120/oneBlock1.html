<p class="heading">Blocks of similar experimental units</p>

  <p>The differences between the experimental treatments can be estimated more
accurately if the experimental units can be grouped into blocks of similar units.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>A randomised block design is equivalent to a separate completely randomised design within each of the blocks.</p>
  </div></div>
  <p>To simplify the design, we initially restrict attention to situations where the block sizes are all equal and are multiples of the number of treatments. All treatments can therefore be used the same number of times within each block.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>Random allocation of treatments to the experimental units within each block is essential.<br>
</p>
  </div></div>

<p>The diagram below shows 48 experimental units on the right. The background shading shows possible grouping of the units into blocks.</p>

<p>The experimental design is initially a completely randomised one that ignores the blocks. Click <strong>Allocate treatments</strong> to randomly allocate the 48 treatments (12 of each type) to the units.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Randomised block</strong> from the pop-up menu. The 48 treatments are split into two groups (both containing 6 of each type). Click <strong>Allocate treatments</strong> to randomise the treatments separately within both blocks.</p>
<p>Now use the second pop-up menu to change the number of blocks and repeat. Observe that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The randomisation always ensures that each treatment is applied to the same number of units within each block.</p>
</div></div>
<p>In practice, there is often flexibility in how the experimental units are grouped into blocks.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>A large number of small blocks is best if this results in more homogeneous experimental units within each block.<br>
