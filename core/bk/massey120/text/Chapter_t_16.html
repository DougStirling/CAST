<h1>Chapter 16 &nbsp; Comparing Proportions</h1>
<h2>16.1 &nbsp; Comparing two proportions</h2>
<h3>16.1.1 &nbsp; Modelling two proportions</h3>
<p>Two-group categorical data can be modelled as samples from two categorical populations with different probabilities of 'success'.</p>
<h3>16.1.2 &nbsp; Distribution of difference in proportions</h3>
<p>The difference between two sample proportions has a distribution that is approximately normal and whose parameters can be estimated using earlier results about the mean and standard deviation of differences.</p>
<h3>16.1.3 &nbsp; CI for difference in proportions</h3>
<p>The standard deviation of the difference between two sample proportions can be estimated. From this, a 95% confidence interval is developed for the difference between two probabilities.</p>
<h3>16.1.4 &nbsp; Testing for difference in probabilities</h3>
<p>A hypothesis test is developed to assess whether two population probabilities are the same.</p>
<h2>16.2 &nbsp; Contingency table association</h2>
<h3>16.2.1 &nbsp; Independence from samples</h3>
<p>Independence is a population property. To assess independence from a sample contingency table, the observed cell counts are compared to those estimated from a model with independence.</p>
<h3>16.2.2 &nbsp; Testing for independence</h3>
<p>The raw sum of squared differences between observed and estimated cell counts is not a good test statistic.</p>
<h3>16.2.3 &nbsp; Chi-squared test statistic</h3>
<p>The 'chi-squared' statistic is a modified sum of squared differences that has a standard distribution (a chi-squared distribution) when there is independence.</p>
<h3>16.2.4 &nbsp; P-value for chi-squared test</h3>
<p>The chi-squared statistic can be used to find a p-value for testing independence. The p-value has similar interpretation and properties to p-values for all other hypothesis tests.</p>
<h3>16.2.5 &nbsp; Examples</h3>
<p>The chi-squared test is applied to a few real data sets. When the variables are found to be associated, the nature of the relationship is described from a comparison of observed and estimated cell counts.</p>
<h3>16.2.6 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h3>
<p>The chi-squared test assesses independence of two categorical variables. It is also used to test whether a single categorical variable has the same distribution in several groups.</p>
<h2>16.3 &nbsp; Exercises</h2>
<h3>16.3.1 &nbsp; CI for difference between two proportions</h3>
<p>Two exercises on this page ask confidence intervals about the difference between two group proportions based on sample proportions; the second is a little harder than the first.</p>
<h3>16.3.2 &nbsp; Test about difference between two proportions</h3>
<p>This exercise asks for the hypotheses, p-value and conclusion when testing whether two group proportions are equal, both with one- and two-tailed alternatives.</p>
<h3>16.3.3 &nbsp; Expected cell counts in contingency tables</h3>
<p>This exercise shows a contingency table and asks for the expected cell count in one of the table cells, assuming the row and column variables are independent.</p>
<h3>16.3.4 &nbsp; Chi-squared test for independence</h3>
<p>In this exercise, the test statistic and p-value are provided for a chi-squared test applied to a contingency table. You are asked to interprete the result of the test.</p>
