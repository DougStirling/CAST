  <p>When looking at the relationship between two variables with a scatterplot, 
		correlation coefficient or contingency table, it is possible to be misled 
		if enough care was not taken in collecting the data.</p>
	<p>We are most interested in discovering <strong>causal</strong> relationships 
		between the variables &mdash; where one variable affects the value of the other. 
		However causal relationships can usually only be inferred from experimental 
		data. </p>
