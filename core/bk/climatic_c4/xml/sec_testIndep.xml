<page dir="en/indep" filePrefix="indep3" summaryDir="en/indep" summaryFilePrefix="s_indep3" videoDir="en/indep" videoFilePrefix="v_indep3">Independence is a population property. To assess independence from a sample contingency table, the observed cell counts are compared to those estimated from a model with independence.</page>
<page dir="en/indep" filePrefix="indep4" summaryDir="en/indep" summaryFilePrefix="s_indep4" videoDir="en/indep" videoFilePrefix="v_indep4">The raw sum of squared differences between observed and estimated cell counts is not a good test statistic.</page>
<page dir="en/indep" filePrefix="indep5" summaryDir="en/indep" summaryFilePrefix="s_indep5" videoDir="en/indep" videoFilePrefix="v_indep5">The 'chi-squared' statistic is a modified sum of squared differences that has a standard distribution (a chi-squared distribution) when there is independence.</page>
<page dir="en/indep" filePrefix="indep6" summaryDir="en/indep" summaryFilePrefix="s_indep6" videoDir="en/indep" videoFilePrefix="v_indep6">The chi-squared statistic can be used to find a p-value for testing independence. The p-value has similar interpretation and properties to p-values for all other hypothesis tests.</page>
<page dir="en/indep" filePrefix="indep7" summaryDir="en/indep" summaryFilePrefix="s_indep7" videoDir="en/indep" videoFilePrefix="v_indep7">The chi-squared test is applied to a few real data sets. When the variables are found to be associated, the nature of the relationship is described from a comparison of observed and estimated cell counts.</page>
<page dir="en/indep" filePrefix="indep8" summaryDir="en/indep" summaryFilePrefix="s_indep8" videoDir="en/indep" videoFilePrefix="v_indep8">The chi-squared test assesses independence of two categorical variables. It is also used to test whether a single categorical variable has the same distribution in several groups.</page>
