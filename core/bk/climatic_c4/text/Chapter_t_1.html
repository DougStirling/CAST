<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; About Relationships</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Association &amp; causal relationships</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Interest in relationships</h3>
<p>For most data sets, we are interested in understanding the relationships between the variables. However interpreting relationships must be done with care.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; Causal and non-causal relationships</h3>
<p>If the relationship between X and Y is causal, it is possible to predict the effect of changing the value of X.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h3>
<p>Causality can only be deduced from how the data were collected â€” the data values themselves do not contain any information about causality.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h3>
<p>In an observational study, values are passively recorded from individuals. Experiments are characterised by the experimenter's control over the values of one or more variables.</p>
<h3>1.1.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h3>
<p>Causal relationships can only be deduced from well-designed experiments.</p>
<h2>1.2 &nbsp; Marginal relationships</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 &nbsp; Misleading marginal correlation</h3>
<p>Variables Y and X may be positively correlated overall, but have zero or even negative correlation at each value of a categorical variable, Z. The variable Z is called a lurking (or hidden) variable.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 &nbsp; Misleading marginal difference in means</h3>
<p>A lurking variable can also distort the difference between the means of Y in two groups (i.e. for two values of a categorical variable, X).</p>
<h3>1.2.3 &nbsp; Simpsons paradox</h3>
<p>If X, Y and Z are all categorical, a reversal of the marginal relationship between X and Y and their conditional relationships for different values of Z is called Simpson's paradox.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 &nbsp; Other examples with lurking variables</h3>
<p>A few extra examples are shown where a hidden variable, Z, can result in a misleading conclusion from the marginal relationship. A full analysis using Z is always more complex but is essential to understand the relationship.</p>
