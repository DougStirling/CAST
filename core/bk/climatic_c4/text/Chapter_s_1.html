<h2 class="pageName">1.1.1 &nbsp; Interest in relationships</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>We are often interested in relationships between variables. The correlation between two numerical variables summarises their relationship; a contingency table  contains information about the relationship between two categorical variables.</p>
<p>When the individuals can be split into groups, a categorical variable can
be used to define group membership. Differences between the groups can then be
expressed as a relationship between the grouping variable and other variables.
The following questions are essentially asking the same in two different ways:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Do boys and girls aged 14 perform the same at maths?</dt>
	<dt>Is there a relationship between gender and mark in a maths test?</dt>
</dl>
<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
	evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>

<p>Relationships can be much harder to interpret than you might think</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.1.2 &nbsp; Causal and non-causal relationships</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>When two variables are related, we say that there is <strong>association</strong> between them.</p>
	<p class="heading">Causal relationships</p>
	<p>A <strong>causal relationship</strong> arises when we can conclude that one variable has a <strong>direct
influence</strong> on the other.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln1.gif" width="297" height="65"></p>
	<p class="heading">Non-causal relationships</p>
	<p>In non-causal relationships, the association between the two variables is not completely the result of 
		one variable directly affecting the other.</p>
	<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln2.gif" width="297" height="154"></td>
			<td><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/reln3.gif" width="297" height="120"></td>
			</tr>
	</table></div>
	<p>If two variables are <strong>not</strong> causally related, it is impossible 
		to tell whether changes to one variable, <em>X</em>, will result in changes to 
		the other variable, <em>Y</em>.</p>
	<p>The scatterplot below shows data from a sample of towns in a region. Neither variable directly affects the other. (The size of the towns is a lurking variable since larger towns have more churches and also more deaths.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/causal/images/cancerChurch.gif" width="325" height="272"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.1.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Is a relationship causal?</p>
	<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
		the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
		adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change.</p>
	<p>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
	collected. <strong>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</strong></p>
	<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
	<p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables called <strong>lurking variables</strong> that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
  it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.1.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Individuals / units</p>
	<p>Most data sets consist of one or more values that are recorded from each of 
		a set of <strong>individuals</strong> (or plants, plots of land, repetitions of an experiment or 
		other 'units'). There are two different ways in which data can be collected from these units.</p>
<p class="heading">Types of data collection</p>
	<p>In an <strong>observational study</strong>, we passively 
		record (observe) values from each unit. Usually these units are sampled from some population.</p>
	<p>In an <strong>experiment</strong>, the researcher actively changes some characteristics 
		of the units before the data are collected. The values of some variables are therefore <strong>under the control of the experimenter</strong>. In other words, the experimenter 
		is able to <strong>choose</strong> each individual's values for some variables.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.1.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Observational studies and experiments</p>
	<p>The method of data collection has a major influence on whether a relationship 
		can be interpreted as causal.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Observational study</dt>
		<dd>There is usually the potential for a lurking 
				variable to underlie any observed relationship, so it is difficult to interpret 
		relationships.</dd>
		<dt>Experiment</dt>
		<dd>Provided the experiment has been designed well, there is little chance of lurking variables 
		driving the observed relationships, so any relationship will be causal.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>In a <strong>badly</strong> designed experiment however, lurking variables 
		can still cause difficulties in interpreting relationships.</p>

<p class="heading">Relationship between two numerical variables</p>
	<p>Scatterplots, correlation coefficients and least squares lines honestly summarise the relationship between two numerical variables, <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>
	<p>However they can sometimes give 
		a misleading impression about the relationship. The problem arises when other variables are also associated with both <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>

		<dd>The relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> that is evident within subsets of the data corresponding 
		to different values of <em>Z</em>.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The marginal and conditional relationships between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> are often different and may even be in a different direction.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/lurking/images/s_margCondit.gif" width="550" height="269"></p>
	<p class="heading">Lurking (or hidden) variables</p>
	<p>If the marginal relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> is different 
		from their conditional relationship given <em>Z</em>, but <em>Z</em> has either 
		not been recorded or is ignored when analysing the data, then <em>Z</em> is 
		called a <strong>lurking </strong>variable (or a <strong>hidden</strong> variable).</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Always think about whether there might be a lurking

<h2 class="pageName">1.2.2 &nbsp; Misleading marginal difference in means</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable</p>
	<p>The previous page showed that the marginal relationship between two numerical 
		variables, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, can be very different from their conditional 
		relationship for specific values of <em>Z</em>. The same can happen when <em>X</em> is a categorical variable, perhaps defining different groups. </p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.2.3 &nbsp; Simpsons paradox</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Lurking variables and relationships between categorical variables</p>
	<p>When the direction of the relationship reverses, the effect is called <strong>Simpson's 
		paradox</strong>. As with other 'paradoxes', there is no real contradiction; it 
		just takes a bit more thought to understand why your initial intuition is wrong.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.2.4 &nbsp; Other examples with lurking variables</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Analysis using 'lurking' variables</p>
	<p>Variables are only called 'lurking' variables if they are either <strong>unrecorded </strong>or are<strong> unused</strong> when analysing the data. In this section's examples, we presented two analyses of the data sets:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>A simple naive analysis ignoring the lurking variable, and</li>
		<li>A more complete analysis using this variable (which should therefore no 
			longer be called 'lurking')</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Although the simple analysis can result in wrong conclusions, a full analysis 
		using the 'lurking' variable is always more complex.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Do not ignore lurking variables to simplify the analysis &mdash;
