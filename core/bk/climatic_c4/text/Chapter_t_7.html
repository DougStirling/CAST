<h1>Chapter 7 &nbsp; Inference for Regression</h1>
<h2>7.1 &nbsp; Testing regression parameters</h2>
<h3>7.1.1 &nbsp; Importance of zero slope</h3>
<p>If the model's slope is zero, the response distribution does not depend on the explanatory variable. This special case is particularly meaningful in many studies.</p>
<h3>7.1.2 &nbsp; Testing whether slope is zero</h3>
<p>The p-value for testing whether a linear model's slope is zero is the probability that its least squares estimate is as far from zero as the recorded value.</p>
<h3>7.1.3 &nbsp; Strength of evidence and relationship</h3>
<p>It is important to distinguish the strength of a relationship (summarised by the correlation coefficient) and the strength of evidence for existence of a relationship (summarised by the p-value).</p>
<h3>7.1.4 &nbsp; Properties of p-values</h3>
<p>As with other tests, all p-values between 0 and 1 are equally likely if the null hypothesis holds (model slope is zero), but p-values nearï¿½0 are more likely if the alternative hypothesis holds (model slope is non-zero).</p>
<h2>7.2 &nbsp; Predicting the response</h2>
<h3>7.2.1 &nbsp; Estimated response distn at X</h3>
<p>From estimates of the 3 linear model parameters, we can obtain an estimated response distribution at any x-value.</p>
<h3>7.2.2 &nbsp; Variability of estimate at X</h3>
<p>The predicted response at any X varies from sample to sample. The prediction is more variable at x-values far from the mean of the 'training' data.</p>
<h3>7.2.3 &nbsp; Estimating the mean vs prediction</h3>
<p>A distinction is made between estimating the mean response at X and predicting a new individual's response at X. Errors are larger (on average) when predicting a new individual's response.</p>
<h3>7.2.4 &nbsp; Confidence and prediction intervals</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence interval is used to estimate the mean response at X. A 95% prediction interval is similar, but gives a range of likely values for a new response value. The prediction interval is wider than the confidence interval.</p>
