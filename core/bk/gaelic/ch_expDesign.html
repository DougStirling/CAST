<p>When data are collected in a survey (an observational study), relationships 
between the variables may be observed, but it is difficult to conclude that either 
variable <strong>causally</strong> affects the other. On the other hand, data 
that are collected in well-designed experiments do give information about causal 
relationships.</p>
<p>If an experiment is poorly designed, the data may not contain the information 
necessary to answer questions posed by the investigator. Many experiments have 
been conducted at great expense and over a long period of time, from which conclusions 
could not be drawn due to poor statistical design.</p>

<p>More positively, <strong>good statistical design</strong> of experiments will 
provide more accurate answers to questions of interest and can save a considerable 
amount of money.</p>
