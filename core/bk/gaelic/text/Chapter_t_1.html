<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; Introduction: About Data</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Context</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Importance of context</h3>
<p>The focus of statistics is to answer questions that are expressed in the language of some application area. Statistical methods for analysis of data are a core part of statistics, but the context of the data is most important.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; Statistics</h3>
<p>Statistical analysis is a process that involves identifying the questions of interest, data collection and analysis and producing a report. In real-life problems, the data collection and analysis steps may be repeated more than once.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; The statistical process</h3>
<p>In many applications, the cycle of data collection and analysis is a central part of the quest for improvement to systems and processes.</p>
<h2>1.2 &nbsp; Standard data structures</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 &nbsp; Variables and individuals</h3>
<p>Most data sets contain one or more measurements from each of a collection of 'individuals' (also called 'cases' or 'units').</p>
<h3>1.2.2 &nbsp; Types of variable</h3>
<p>Variables are classified into numerical and categorical variables. A finer classification is also sketched.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 &nbsp; Categorical variables and groups</h3>
<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the 'individuals' into groups. Equivalently, grouped data can be represented in a data matrix with a categorical variable.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 &nbsp; Defining new variables</h3>
<p>Sometimes a ratio or difference of two variables in a data matrix is easier to interpret  than the original variables.</p>
<h3>1.2.5 &nbsp; Time-ordered data</h3>
<p>In some data matrices, the rows are time-ordered.</p>
<h3>1.2.6 &nbsp; Multi-level data</h3>
<p>Sometimes information is available at both group and individual level -- multi-level data. These data are most naturally stored in two data matrices.</p>
<h3>1.2.7 &nbsp; Data structure to statistical method</h3>
<p>Statistical analysis is specific to the structure of the data (i.e. the types of variable in the data matrix). CAST starts with descriptive methods to explore data; it then moves on to inferential methods that take account of randomness in the data.</p>
<h2>1.3 &nbsp; Variation</h2>
<h3>1.3.1 &nbsp; Signal and noise</h3>
<p>In many situations, information (signal) can be obscured by random variation (noise).</p>
<h3>1.3.2 &nbsp; Natural variability</h3>
<p>When data are collected from 'individuals', they often vary considerably.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 &nbsp; Variability caused by experiments</h3>
<p>Intentional differences to experimental conditions may also cause systematic differences in variables. Natural variability makes it harder to interpret experimental results.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 &nbsp; Variability in survey data</h3>
<p>The natural variability of individuals also makes it harder to interpret information from surveys.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 &nbsp; Explained and unexplained variation</h3>
<p>Some variation in a variable can be explained in terms of other recorded variables. Other variation is a result of natural variability in the individuals.</p>
<h3>1.3.6 &nbsp; Predicting future values</h3>
<p>Variation in a data set can help us to predict the  values that might occur if further data of the same kind are collected in the future.</p>
