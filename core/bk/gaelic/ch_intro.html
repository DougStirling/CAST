<p>In a wide range of professions, decisions are required and conclusions must 
	be reached about alternative courses of action. Data must be collected to 
	throw light on these problems. Statistics is a body of techniques that provides 
	useful information to decision-makers from such data.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Medical treatments are based on the results of drug
		trials and objective assessment of alternative therapies.
		<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Business decisions are increasingly based on data
		rather than 'intuition'.
		<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ecologists use data about the abundance of species to assess changes in habitats.
		<br>&nbsp;</li>
	  <li>Climatic data are analysed to help recommend agricultural practices. <br>
			&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Educators record marks from students to assess students, teachers and courses.
		<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>

  <p>Although there is much to be said for teaching statistics within the context 
		of an application area that is relevant to the career of the person learning 
		the subject, statistical data analysis is based on the same approach and basic 
		'toolbox' of techniques in all subject areas. </p>

<p>By teaching statistics as a separate discipline, we emphasise this common approach
to using data to obtain information about real-life problems.
