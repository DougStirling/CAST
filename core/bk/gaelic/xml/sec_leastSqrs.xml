<page dir='gd/leastSqrs' filePrefix='leastSqrs1'>A line or curve is useful for predicting the value of Y from a known value of X.</page>
<page dir='gd/leastSqrs' filePrefix='leastSqrs2'>A straight line can often be used to predict one variable from another.</page>
<page dir='gd/leastSqrs' filePrefix='leastSqrs3'>The difference between the actual value of Y and the value predicted by a line is called a residual. Small residuals are clearly desirable.</page>
<page dir='gd/leastSqrs' filePrefix='leastSqrs4'>The sum of squared residuals describes the accuracy of predictions from a line. The method of least squares positions the line to minimise the sum of squared residuals.</page>
<page dir='gd/leastSqrs' filePrefix='leastSqrs5'>A linear model is not appropriate if there are either curvature or outliers in a scatterplot of the data. Outliers should be carefully examined.</page>
<page dir='gd/leastSqrs' filePrefix='leastSqrs6'>Outliers and curvature in the relationship are often displayed more clearly in a plot of residuals.</page>
<page dir='gd/leastSqrs' filePrefix='leastSqrs7' note='(advanced)'>Least squares does not treat Y and X symmetrically. The best line for predicting Y from X is different from the best line for predicting X from Y.</page>
