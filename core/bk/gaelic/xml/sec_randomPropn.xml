<topText><![CDATA[
	<p>Categorical data sets are usually summarised by the proportions in the categories. For sample data, these proportions are random variables and have distributions.</p>

<page dir='gd/randomPropn' filePrefix='randomPropn1'>The population proportion in a category is called its probability. Proportions and probabilities can be obtained from categorical and numerical variables.</page>
<page dir='gd/randomPropn' filePrefix='randomPropn2'>The sample proportion is a statistic that varies from sample to sample. The sample count in a category is also random with a discrete distribution.</page>
<page dir='gd/randomPropn' filePrefix='randomPropn3'>The sample count in a category has a standard distribution called a binomial distribution with parameters n and &amp;pi;.</page>
<page dir='gd/randomPropn' filePrefix='randomPropn4'>The binomial distribution can be used to find probabilities relating to sample counts.</page>
<page dir='gd/randomPropn' filePrefix='randomPropn5'>When the sample size is large, the distribution of the sample count in a category becomes close to a normal distribution.</page>
<page dir='gd/randomPropn' filePrefix='randomPropn6'>When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find binomial probabilities.</page>
