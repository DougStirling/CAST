<page dir='gd/causal' filePrefix='causal1'>For most data sets, we are interested in understanding the relationships between the variables. However interpreting relationships must be done with care.</page>
<page dir='gd/causal' filePrefix='causal2'>If the relationship between X and Y is causal, it is possible to predict the effect of changing the value of X.</page>
<page dir='gd/causal' filePrefix='causal3'>Causality can only be deduced from how the data were collected &amp;mdash; the data values themselves do not contain any information about causality.</page>
<page dir='gd/causal' filePrefix='causal4'>In an observational study, values are passively recorded from individuals. Experiments are characterised by the experimenter's control over the values of one or more variables.</page>
<page dir='gd/causal' filePrefix='causal5'>Causal relationships can only be deduced from well-designed experiments.</page>
