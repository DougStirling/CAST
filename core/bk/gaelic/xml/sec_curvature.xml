<page dir='gd/curvature' filePrefix='curvature1'>The correlation coefficient does not adequately describe the strength of a nonlinear relationship. Transforming the variables to linearise the relationship helps.</page>
<page dir='gd/curvature' filePrefix='curvature2'>If a relationship is nonlinear, a linear model can often be fitted to transformed response or explanatory variables.</page>
<page dir='gd/curvature' filePrefix='curvature3'>An alternative solution to nonlinearity is to fit a quadratic curve the data, again using the principle of least squares.</page>
<page dir='gd/curvature' filePrefix='curvature4'>Since the form of a relationship is unknown beyond the range of x-values in the data, it is always dangerous to extrapolate.</page>
