<page dir='gd/regnGroups' filePrefix='regnGroups1'>Correlation and least squares are used to describe the relationship between two numerical variables. Additional measurements from each individual can potentially help to refine our understanding of the relationship.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnGroups' filePrefix='regnGroups2'>Different symbols or colours can be used to represent a third categorical variable in a scatterplot.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnGroups' filePrefix='regnGroups3'>The relationship between Y and X can be separately described by a least squares line within each group. This should lead to improved prediction of the response if the relationship is different in different groups.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnGroups' filePrefix='regnGroups4'>If regression lines for the different groups are parallel, it is easy to summarise the group differences numerically and interpret these differences.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnGroups' filePrefix='regnGroups5' note='(advanced)'>Transformations may linearise the relationship between the response and explanatory variables in each group and also give parallel regression lines.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnGroups' filePrefix='regnGroups6' note='(optional)'>A numerical variable can be used to split the individuals into groups.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnGroups' filePrefix='regnGroups7'>Groups can also be represented with different symbols or colours on a scatterplot matrix that describes the relationships between 3 or more other variables.</page>
