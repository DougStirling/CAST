	<p>You can reach the wrong conclusions by analysing two variables on their own. The apparent relationship may be caused by one or more further variables.</p>

<page dir='gd/lurking' filePrefix='lurking1'>Variables Y and X may be positively correlated overall, but have zero or even negative correlation at each value of a categorical variable, Z. The variable Z is called a lurking (or hidden) variable.</page>
<page dir='gd/lurking' filePrefix='lurking2'>A lurking variable can also distort the difference between the means of Y in two groups (i.e. for two values of a categorical variable, X).</page>
<page dir='gd/lurking' filePrefix='lurking3'>If X, Y and Z are all categorical, a reversal of the marginal relationship between X and Y and their conditional relationships for different values of Z is called Simpson's paradox.</page>
<page dir='gd/lurking' filePrefix='lurking4'>A few extra examples are shown where a hidden variable, Z, can result in a misleading conclusion from the marginal relationship. A full analysis using Z is always more complex but is essential to understand the relationship.</page>
