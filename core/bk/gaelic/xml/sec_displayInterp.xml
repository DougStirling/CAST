<page dir='gd/displayInterp' filePrefix='displayInterp1'>Does the data contain any outliers -- values that are atypically large or small? The extreme values in a skew distribution are often mistaken for outliers.</page>
<page dir='gd/displayInterp' filePrefix='displayInterp2'>Does the data split into separate clusters -- ranges of values with high density separated by ranges with low density? Clusters may correspond to different groups of individuals.</page>
<page dir='gd/displayInterp' filePrefix='displayInterp3'>The distribution gives information about a typical value round which the data are spread (the distribution's location or centre) and the variability of the values (the spread of the distribution).</page>
<page dir='gd/displayInterp' filePrefix='displayInterp4'>Additional information about the items from which measurements have been made can help us understand the distribution of values in the data.</page>
<page dir='gd/displayInterp' filePrefix='displayInterp5'>If we know that the values come from 2 or more groups of individuals, dot plots can be modified to show this extra information.</page>
<page dir='gd/displayInterp' filePrefix='displayInterp6'>There is a risk of over-interpreting patterns in small data sets.</page>
