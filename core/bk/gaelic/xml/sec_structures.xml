<page dir='gd/structures' filePrefix='structures1'>Most data sets contain one or more measurements from each of a collection of 'individuals' (also called 'cases' or 'units').</page>
<page dir='gd/structures' filePrefix='structures2'>Variables are classified into numerical and categorical variables. A finer classification is also sketched.</page>
<page dir='gd/structures' filePrefix='structures3'>A categorical variable can be used to split the 'individuals' into groups. Equivalently, grouped data can be represented in a data matrix with a categorical variable.</page>
<page dir='gd/structures' filePrefix='structures4'>Sometimes a ratio or difference of two variables in a data matrix is easier to interpret  than the original variables.</page>
<page dir='gd/structures' filePrefix='structures5'>In some data matrices, the rows are time-ordered.</page>
<page dir='gd/structures' filePrefix='structures6' note='(advanced)'>Sometimes information is available at both group and individual level -- multi-level data. These data are most naturally stored in two data matrices.</page>
<page dir='gd/structures' filePrefix='structures7'>Statistical analysis is specific to the structure of the data (i.e. the types of variable in the data matrix). CAST starts with descriptive methods to explore data; it then moves on to inferential methods that take account of randomness in the data.</page>
