<section name='Describing centre and spread'>

<page dir='gd/centerSpread' filePrefix='centerSpread1'>The centre of a distribution is a 'typical value'. The spread describes how far the values are from the centre.</page>
<page dir='gd/centerSpread' filePrefix='centerSpread2'>The median is a summary of the centre of a distribution. The range and inter-quartile range both describe spread.</page>
<page dir='gd/centerSpread' filePrefix='centerSpread3'>The median and mean are alternative measures of the centre of a distribution.</page>
<page dir='gd/centerSpread' filePrefix='centerSpread4'>When a data set is not symmetric, the mean and median may differ substantially.</page>
<page dir='gd/centerSpread' filePrefix='centerSpread5'>The standard deviation is the most commonly used numerical summary of the spread of values in a data set.</page>
<page dir='gd/centerSpread' filePrefix='centerSpread6'>The 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb is useful for understanding the numerical value of the standard deviation.</page>
<page dir='gd/centerSpread' filePrefix='centerSpread7'>It is possible to roughly guess the mean and standard deviation from a histogram and roughly sketch a symmetric histogram matching any given mean and standard deviation.</page>
<page dir='gd/centerSpread' filePrefix='centerSpread8'>The mean and standard deviation cannot give any indication of the existance of outliers, skewness or clusters. A dot plot or histogram should be examined before reporting these numerical summaries.</page>
