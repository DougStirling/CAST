<page dir='gd/timePlot' filePrefix='timePlot1'>A time series plot is similar to a scatterplot with 'time' as the variable on the horizontal axis. Successive values are usually joined by lines to emphasise systematic movements in the series.</page>
<page dir='gd/timePlot' filePrefix='timePlot2'>A few examples show time series with trend, seasonal pattern and other oscillations.</page>
<page dir='gd/timePlot' filePrefix='timePlot3'>An example shows four different time series on the same graph.</page>
