<page dir='gd/groupedCat' filePrefix='groupedCat1'>Categorical data collected from different groups can be shown in a contingency table. It contains a simple frequency table for each group.</page>
<page dir='gd/groupedCat' filePrefix='groupedCat2'>Contingency tables sometimes arise from experiments. Data collected from surveys are often presented in contingency tables.</page>
<page dir='gd/groupedCat' filePrefix='groupedCat3'>It is easier to compare groups if bar charts are drawn from the proportions within each group rather than the frequencies.</page>
<page dir='gd/groupedCat' filePrefix='groupedCat4'>Stacking the bars in each bar chart makes it easier to compare groups. Stacked bar charts are particularly effective for ordinal categorical data.</page>
<page dir='gd/groupedCat' filePrefix='groupedCat5'>When the variable has only two categories, stacked bar charts can be simplified. An example is also given where the grouping forms a time series.</page>
