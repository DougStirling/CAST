<page dir='gd/seasonal' filePrefix='seasonal1'>Seasonal data may show a pattern that repeats at regular intervals.</page>
<page dir='gd/seasonal' filePrefix='seasonal2'>Moving averages with order equal to the number of seasons can smooth out seasonal variation.</page>
<page dir='gd/seasonal' filePrefix='seasonal3'>The average difference between the data and the corresponding smoothed values in any month is called the seasonal effect for that month.</page>
<page dir='gd/seasonal' filePrefix='seasonal4'>Subtracting the seasonal effect from the raw data is called seasonally adjusting the data and the resulting values are called deseasonalised.</page>
<page dir='gd/seasonal' filePrefix='seasonal5'>Seasonal data can be split into four components -- seasonal, trend, cyclical and residual.</page>
<page dir='gd/seasonal' filePrefix='seasonal6'>The seasonal, trend and cyclical components of a time series can each be forecast into the future. Adding them provides a forecast for future values. </page>
