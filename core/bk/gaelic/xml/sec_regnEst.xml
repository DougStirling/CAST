<page dir='gd/regnEst' filePrefix='regnEst1'>A least squares line provides estimates of the linear model's slope and intercept. These estimates are random values &amp;mdash; they vary from sample to sample.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnEst' filePrefix='regnEst2'>The third parameter of the normal linear model is the error standard deviation. It can be estimated using the residuals from the least squares line.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnEst' filePrefix='regnEst3'>The least squares estimate of the model's slope has a normal distribution that is centred on the true value.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnEst' filePrefix='regnEst4'>The distribution of the least squares slope may be estimated from a single data set.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnEst' filePrefix='regnEst5'>A confidence interval for the model's slope can be obtained from its least squares estimate and its standard error.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnEst' filePrefix='regnEst6'>Confidence intervals for the model's slope have the same properties as confidence intervals for population means or proportions.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnEst' filePrefix='regnEst7' note='(advanced)'>The standard error of the least squares slope depends on the response standard deviation round the model line, the sample size and the standard deviation of X. Collecting data with a big spread of x-values gives more accurate estimates but there are disadvantages.</page>
