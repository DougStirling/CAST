<page dir='gd/trend' filePrefix='trend1'>Many time series steadily increase or decrease over time and a linear model may describe the trend. This kind of model can be fitted by least squares.</page>
<page dir='gd/trend' filePrefix='trend2'>If the trend is nonlinear, a quadratic model might describe the trend better and can also be fitted by least squares.</page>
<page dir='gd/trend' filePrefix='trend3'>Linear and quadratic models can be used to forecast future values.</page>
<page dir='gd/trend' filePrefix='trend4'>If a quadratic model does not adequately describe a nonlinear trend, it is possible to add higher powers of time to the model. These polynomial models may give a smooth picture of past trend but should not be used to forecast into the future.</page>
<page dir='gd/trend' filePrefix='trend5'>Polynomial models are only useful to describe a smooth long-term trend in a time series. A time series plot of least squares residuals (actual values minus trend) highlights shorter-term movements in the series.</page>
