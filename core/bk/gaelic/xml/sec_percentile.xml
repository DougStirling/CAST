<page dir='gd/percentile' filePrefix='percentile1'>A data set containing annual rainfalls in Samaru, Nigeria, will be used for illustrative purposes.</page>
<page dir='gd/percentile' filePrefix='percentile2'>Half the data are lower than the median. A quarter and three quarters are lower than the lower and upper quartiles. At any other value, x, the proportion of data values that are x or lower is called its cumulative proportion.</page>
<page dir='gd/percentile' filePrefix='percentile3'>A graph of the cumulative proportion below x against x is a step function that increases from zero (at small x) to one (at high x).</page>
<page dir='gd/percentile' filePrefix='percentile4'>Given any target proportion, p, it is possible to find a corresponding value, x, for which approximately this proportion of values is x or lower. For example, the percentile for p = 50% is the median.</page>
<page dir='gd/percentile' filePrefix='percentile5'>The 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100'th percentiles are displayed as a box plot. Other percentiles can be displayed in a similar shaded rectangle.</page>
<page dir='gd/percentile' filePrefix='percentile6'>Box plots are useful for comparing groups. If the groups are in order (e.g. the months of a year), the median, quartiles and extremes can be joined and shaded as bands. This effectively describes how the distribution of values varies.</page>
<page dir='gd/percentile' filePrefix='percentile7'>In some applications, different percentiles are important. They can also be joined and shaded as bands to compare ordered groups.</page>
<page dir='gd/percentile' filePrefix='percentile8' note='(advanced)'>The graph of cumulative probabilities is a step function. Most software reports percentiles that are equivalent to reading values off a smoothed version of this step function.</page>
