	<p>Box plots highly summarise the distribution of values in a data set. They are useful for comparing different batches of values.</p>

<page dir='gd/boxPlot' filePrefix='boxPlot1'>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain detailed information that is distracting when two or more data sets are being compared.</page>
<page dir='gd/boxPlot' filePrefix='boxPlot2'>The median and quartiles split a batch of values into four equal-sized sets of values. A box plot is a graphical display of the median, quartiles and extremes.</page>
<page dir='gd/boxPlot' filePrefix='boxPlot3'>A box plot clearly shows the centre, spread and skewness of a data set. It splits the corresponding histogram into 4 approximately equal areas.</page>
<page dir='gd/boxPlot' filePrefix='boxPlot4'>The basic box plot is often modified to display outliers as separate crosses.</page>
<page dir='gd/boxPlot' filePrefix='boxPlot5'>Box plots cannot show clusters, so must never be used for data with clusters.</page>
<page dir='gd/boxPlot' filePrefix='boxPlot6'>Box plots are particularly effective for displaying differences between several groups of values.</page>
<page dir='gd/boxPlot' filePrefix='boxPlot7'>Box plots are relatively stable, and contain less 'noise' than other displays. They can concisely describe differences between even small groups.</page>
