	<p>A normal linear model explains how the distribution of a response variable, Y, depends on an explanatory variable, X.</p>
]]></topText>


<page dir='gd/regnModel' filePrefix='regnModel1'>Some bivariate data sets describe complete populations. Others are 'representative' of an underlying population or process.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnModel' filePrefix='regnModel2'>Bivariate data can be modelled by specifying a response distribution for each possible X.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnModel' filePrefix='regnModel3'>The response is often modelled with a normal distribution whose mean is a linear function of X and whose standard deviation is constant.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnModel' filePrefix='regnModel4'>A normal linear model can be described in terms of 'errors'. In samples from the model, approximately 95% of errors are within 2 standard deviations of zero, so about 95% of the points in a scatterplot are within this distance of the regression line.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnModel' filePrefix='regnModel5'>The normal linear model has 3 unknown parameters. For many data sets, these parameters have meaningful interpretations.</page>
