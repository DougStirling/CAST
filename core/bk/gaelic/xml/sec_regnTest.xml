<page dir='gd/regnTest' filePrefix='regnTest1'>If the model's slope is zero, the response distribution does not depend on the explanatory variable. This special case is particularly meaningful in many studies.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnTest' filePrefix='regnTest2'>The p-value for testing whether a linear model's slope is zero is the probability that its least squares estimate is as far from zero as the recorded value.</page>
<page dir='gd/regnTest' filePrefix='regnTest3'>It is important to distinguish the strength of a relationship (summarised by the correlation coefficient) and the strength of evidence for existence of a relationship (summarised by the p-value).</page>
<page dir='gd/regnTest' filePrefix='regnTest4' note='(advanced)'>As with other tests, all p-values between 0 and 1 are equally likely if the null hypothesis holds (model slope is zero), but p-values nearÂ 0 are more likely if the alternative hypothesis holds (model slope is non-zero).</page>
