	<p>When data are collected, all values are rarely the same. An important role of statistics is to describe and analyse this variation.</p>

<page dir='gd/variation' filePrefix='variation1'>In many situations, information (signal) can be obscured by random variation (noise).</page>
<page dir='gd/variation' filePrefix='variation2'>When data are collected from 'individuals', they often vary considerably.</page>
<page dir='gd/variation' filePrefix='variation3'>Intentional differences to experimental conditions may also cause systematic differences in variables. Natural variability makes it harder to interpret experimental results.</page>
<page dir='gd/variation' filePrefix='variation4'>The natural variability of individuals also makes it harder to interpret information from surveys.</page>
<page dir='gd/variation' filePrefix='variation5'>Some variation in a variable can be explained in terms of other recorded variables. Other variation is a result of natural variability in the individuals.</page>
<page dir='gd/variation' filePrefix='variation6'>Variation in a data set can help us to predict the  values that might occur if further data of the same kind are collected in the future.</page>
