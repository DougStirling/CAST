	<p>A histogram does not separately display the individual values. In large data sets it displays the major features of the distribution  better than dot plots or stem and leaf plots.</p>

<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density1'>The heights of the stacks of crosses in a dot plot  describe the density of values.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density2'>In a simple histogram, the height of the rectangle above each class on the axis equals the number of values in the class -- the class frequency.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density3'>Class width and start-point should be chosen to make the histogram as smooth as possible -- neither too blocky nor too jagged.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density4'>The shape of a histogram can be very dependent on the choice of classes if the data set is small; beware over-interpreting its shape. Stacked dot plots are a better display of small data sets.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density5'>In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density6'>The vertical axis should be relative frequency, not frequency, when comparing two groups with histograms. Population pyramids are often used to compare age distributions.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density7'>If a histogram has varying class widths, the vertical axis must be 'density'. The histogram shape would be misleading if frequency or relative frequency was used for the vertical axis.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density8'>The proportion of values in any classes always equals the proportion of the total histogram area that is above the classes.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density9'>Frequency polygons are closely related to histograms but give a less 'blocky' display of density. Different groups can be compared more easily with them.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density10' note='(optional)'>Kernel density estimates show density in a still smoother display.</page>
<page dir='gd/density' filePrefix='density11' note='(optional)'>Histograms are based on frequency tables. Class boundaries should avoid possible data values.</page>
