<p class="heading notPrinted">Time series data</p>
	<p>Data sets whose measurements  are made sequentially at regular 
		intervals are called <strong>time series</strong>. We often want to forecast
future values of a time series.</p>
<p class="heading">The importance of plotting</p>
	<p>As with other data structures, the information 
		in a time series is most easily understood from a <strong>graphical</strong> display.
A <strong>time series plot</strong> is a type of scatterplot whose horizontal
axis shows the time-ordering of the values. Successive crosses are often  joined
by lines.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">4.1.2 &nbsp; Patterns in time series</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Types of pattern</p>
	<div class="centred"><table class="centred" width="90%">
	<tr><th width="50%">Trend</th>
	<th width="50%">Seasonal variation</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
<td>Trend refers to long-term increases and decreases in the values.
		<div class="centred"><img src="../../../en/timePlot/images/pattern_trend.gif" width="204" height="135"> </p>
	<p>Moving 
		averages are also called <strong>running means</strong>. In the example below,
a 7-point moving average replaces each value with the mean of it and the 3 adjacent
 values on each side.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/smoothing/images/s_movingAverage.gif" width="501" height="249">          <img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/movingAverage4.gif" width="237" height="218"></p>
	<p>If averaging over an even number of values, the smoothed value is for a time between those of the data values, such as &quot;year 2005.5&quot;.</p>
	<p class="heading">A second stage of averaging for even run lengths</p>
	<p>To provide smoothed values at the same times as the raw data, we often take a further 2-point moving average.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/movingAverageDouble.gif" width="428" height="218"> </p>
	<p>This is equivalent to giving <strong>half weight</strong> to the two outermost values. If  based on moving averages of 4, this is called a 4-point centred moving average.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>These centred averages are particularly useful when analysing seasonal data. For example, 12-point centred moving averages are often used for monthly data.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">4.2.3 &nbsp; Robust smoothing</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Outliers and running medians</p>
	<p>Since medians are less sensitive to outliers than means, a more robust alternative to running means replaces each value by the <strong>median</strong> of it and adjacent values. A <strong>3-point running median</strong> is: </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/runningMedianEqn.gif" width="225" height="25"> </p>
	<p>and higher-order running medians will use more adjacent values. </p>
	<p class="heading">Comparison of means and medians</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Moving averages are more affected by outliers in the series</li>
		<li>Running medians often have a 'stepped' appearance &mdash; the smoothed series 
			is level for periods, followed by relatively sharp jumps.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/smoothing/images/s_meanMedian.gif" width="539" height="283"> </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expSmoothEqn.gif" width="175" height="25"></p>
	<p>where the smoothing constant, <i>a</i>, is a value between 0 and 1. The smoothed
value is a 'weighted average' of the actual value at that time and the previous
smoothed value.</p>
<p class="heading">Alternative formula</p>
	<p>The formula can also be expressed as </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expSmoothEqn2.gif" width="486" height="26"></p>
	<p>For example, if <em>a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2 </sub>, </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expSmoothHalf.gif" width="299" height="26"> </p>
	<p>The smoothed value puts more weight on the recent past (which is an intuitively sensible thing to do).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The closer <em>a</em> becomes to one, the greater the influence of the
actual value, and the less smoothing.</li>
		<li>The closer <em>a</em> becomes to zero, the more smoothing.</li>
</ul>
	<p class="heading">Forecasting future values</p>
	<p>If the most recent value is at time <em>i</em>, we forecast
the value at time <em>i</em> + <em>k</em> to be the last exponentially smoothed
value,</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/smoothing/images/expPredict.gif" width="252" height="23"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>If <i>a</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the forecast is just the last observed value 
			in the time series.</li>
		<li>As <i>a</i> is reduced, the forecast becomes more affected by earlier 
			values in the series.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="heading">Time series with trend</p>
	<p>If the time 
		series has an increasing trend, exponential smoothing will 
		tend to underestimate the trend. Similarly, the smoothed series will be too high if 
		there is a decreasing trend.</p>

	<p class="heading">Recoding the years</p>
	<p>The large intercept in the example above is avoided if the years are recoded
 so that
some year within the range of the data becomes &quot;year 0&quot;.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">4.3.2 &nbsp; Quadratic trend</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Quadratic models</p>
	<p>If the trend in a time series is nonlinear, a linear model should not be
used. A simple model that can explain some simple types of curvature is a <strong>quadratic
model</strong>:</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>trend</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>1</sub><em> time</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>2</sub><em> time</em><sup>2</sup></span> </p>
	<p>This has <strong>three</strong> parameters that 
		can be adjusted to improve the fit of the model. Residuals
 are again defined as</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>e<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>y<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<em>trend<sub>i</sub></em></span> </p>
	<p>and the <strong>least squares</strong> estimates of <em>b</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>
and <em>b</em><sub>2</sub>  are
the values that minimise the residual sum of squares,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><font size="+1">&Sigma;</font> <em>e<sub>i</sub></em><sup>2</sup></span> </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/trend/images/s_quadratic.gif" width="507" height="315"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">4.3.3 &nbsp; Forecasting</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Using linear and quadratic models for forecasting</p>
	<p>After fitting a linear or quadratic model by least squares, forecasting 
		is simply a matter of inserting future time values into its equation.</p>
	<p class="heading">Dangers in forecasting</p>
	<p>It is important to realise that the forecasts from linear or quadratic models
are highly dependent on the type of line or curve that is chosen for modelling.
The dangers are the same as those for extrapolation in bivariate relationships.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Beware forecasting many time periods into the future &mdash; the 
				shape of the actual trend line might be different from your model.</p>
</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">4.3.4 &nbsp; Polynomial trend</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Cubic and higher-degree polynomial models</p>
	<p>If a quadratic model does not adequately describe the shape of the trend in a time series, it is tempting to try to further increase the order of the polynomial,</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>trend</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>1</sub><em> time</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>2</sub><em> time</em><sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em><sub>3</sub><em> time</em><sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;...</span> </p>
	<p>This kind of polynomial model  can also be fitted by least squares.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/trend/images/s_polynomial.gif" width="550" height="327"></p>
	<p>A polynomial of degree 3 or 4 often provides a fairly smooth description
of trend but polynomial models usually behave badly (with sudden increases or
decreases) beyond the data points, so...</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Polynomial models of degree greater than 2 should not be used for forecasting.</p>
	</div></div>

	



<h2 class="pageName">4.3.5 &nbsp; Detrending a time series</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Residuals</p>
	<p>The residuals for a time series model subtract the trend from the values
and are called the <strong>detrended</strong> values,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>e<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>y<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<em>trend<sub>i</sub></em></span> </p>
	<p>If the model under consideration fits well, there should be no 
		pattern in the residuals &mdash; each should have the same chance of being positive 
		or negative.</p>
