<page dir='es/popSamp' filePrefix='popSamp1'>A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</page>
<page dir='es/popSamp' filePrefix='popSamp2'>A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</page>
<page dir='es/popSamp' filePrefix='popSamp3'>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</page>
<page dir='es/popSamp' filePrefix='popSamp4'>As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </page>
<page dir='es/popSamp' filePrefix='popSamp5' note='(optional)'>Sampling with replacement from a finite population permits the same value to be selected two or more times. Sampling without replacement ensures that there are no such duplicates.</page>
<page dir='es/popSamp' filePrefix='popSamp6'>Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</page>
