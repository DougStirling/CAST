<section name='Bivariate categorical distributions'>

<page dir='es/bivarCat' filePrefix='bivarCat1'>If two categorical variables can be treated as a response and explanatory variable, the explanatory variable can be used to split the individuals into groups. If neither variable can be treated as explanatory, we need other ways to describe their association.</page>
<page dir='es/bivarCat' filePrefix='bivarCat2'>Bivariate distributions can be displayed in 3-dimensional bar charts but there are better ways to show the data.</page>
<page dir='es/bivarCat' filePrefix='bivarCat3'>A 2-dimensional bar chart can be used to display the joint distribution of two categorical variables, with the bars clustered by one or other of the variables.</page>
<page dir='es/bivarCat' filePrefix='bivarCat4'>The two marginal distributions are found by adding the joint frequencies (or proportions) across rows or down columns of a contingency table.</page>
<page dir='es/bivarCat' filePrefix='bivarCat5'>Conditional distributions are obtained by scaling the rows (or columns) of a contingency table to make them all sum to 1.0.</page>
<page dir='es/bivarCat' filePrefix='bivarCat6' note='(advanced)'>Be careful to distinguish between the conditional distribution of Y given X, and that of X given Y.</page>
<page dir='es/bivarCat' filePrefix='bivarCat7'>Proportional Venn diagrams are a useful way to display joint distributions and to understand the relationships between conditional and marginal distributions.</page>
