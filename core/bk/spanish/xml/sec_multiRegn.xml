<page dir='es/multiRegn' filePrefix='multiRegn1'>In many data sets, two or more explanatory variables could potentially affect the response. Using two or more explanatory variables may give more accurate predictions.</page>
<page dir='es/multiRegn' filePrefix='multiRegn2'>A simple linear model with a single explanatory variable can be extended with extra terms to explain the additional effect of other explanatory variables.</page>
<page dir='es/multiRegn' filePrefix='multiRegn3'>The slope coefficient associated with an explanatory variable describes its effect if all other variables are held constant. It may have a different sign from the correlation coefficient between the variable and the response.</page>
<page dir='es/multiRegn' filePrefix='multiRegn4'>The relationship between a response variable and two explanatory variables can be effectively displayed in a rotating 3-dimensional scatterplot.</page>
<page dir='es/multiRegn' filePrefix='multiRegn5'>The equation of a linear model for Y in terms of X and Z can be displayed as a plane in 3-dimensions.</page>
<page dir='es/multiRegn' filePrefix='multiRegn6'>The residuals are vertical distances from the crosses on a 3-dimensional scatterplot to the plane representing the model.</page>
<page dir='es/multiRegn' filePrefix='multiRegn7'>An objective estimation method is to minimise the sum of squared residuals — the principle of least squares.</page>
