<page dir='es/relationship' filePrefix='relationship1'>The main feature of interest in a scatterplot is the strength of the relationship between the two variables.</page>
<page dir='es/relationship' filePrefix='relationship2'>An extreme value of one or both of the variables is an outlier. An unusual combination of values is also called an outlier.</page>
<page dir='es/relationship' filePrefix='relationship3'>If the crosses on a scatterplot separate into clusters, different groups of individuals are suggested.</page>
<page dir='es/relationship' filePrefix='relationship4'>In small data sets, there may be considerable variability, so patterns should be strongly evident before they are reported.</page>
<page dir='es/relationship' filePrefix='relationship5'>One variable can often be classified as an explanatory variable that either causally affects the reponse variable, or is useful for predicting its value.</page>
