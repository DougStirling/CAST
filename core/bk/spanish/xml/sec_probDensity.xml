<page dir='es/probDensity' filePrefix='probDensity1'>When randomly selecting one value from a population of N different values, the probability of getting any individual value is 1/N. More generally, the probability of sampling a value in any range is the proportion of population values in the range.</page>
<page dir='es/probDensity' filePrefix='probDensity2'>The probability of any type of value is again the proportion of such values in the population. It can also be interpreted as the limiting proportion from a sample of values if the sample size is increased indefinitely.</page>
<page dir='es/probDensity' filePrefix='probDensity3'>Infinite categorical or discrete populations can be described by bar charts of the probabilities.</page>
<page dir='es/probDensity' filePrefix='probDensity4'>Infinite continuous numerical populations are described with a type of histogram called a probability density function.</page>
<page dir='es/probDensity' filePrefix='probDensity5'>Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters, &amp;micro; and &amp;sigma;, can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</page>
<page dir='es/probDensity' filePrefix='probDensity6'>When a value is sampled from an infinite continuous population, the probability that it is between a and b equals the area under the p.d.f. between these two values.</page>
<page dir='es/probDensity' filePrefix='probDensity7' note='(optional)'>This page describes some rules that are obeyed by probabilities.</page>
