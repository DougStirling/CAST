<section name='Predicting the response'>

<page dir='es/regnPred' filePrefix='regnPred1'>From estimates of the 3 linear model parameters, we can obtain an estimated response distribution at any x-value.</page>
<page dir='es/regnPred' filePrefix='regnPred2'>The predicted response at any X varies from sample to sample. The prediction is more variable at x-values far from the mean of the 'training' data.</page>
<page dir='es/regnPred' filePrefix='regnPred3'>A distinction is made between estimating the mean response at X and predicting a new individual's response at X. Errors are larger (on average) when predicting a new individual's response.</page>
<page dir='es/regnPred' filePrefix='regnPred4'>A 95% confidence interval is used to estimate the mean response at X. A 95% prediction interval is similar, but gives a range of likely values for a new response value. The prediction interval is wider than the confidence interval.</page>
