<page dir='es/smoothing' filePrefix='smoothing1'>Moving averages are a simple way to smooth out irregularities in a time series.</page>
<page dir='es/smoothing' filePrefix='smoothing2'>When an even number of values is used for the moving averages, the smoothed values are at times half-way between those of the raw data. The method can be modified to give smoothed values at the times of the original values.</page>
<page dir='es/smoothing' filePrefix='smoothing3' note='(optional)'>Using running medians instead of means avoids the effect of outliers, but the result often looks 'stepped'. The use of running medians, followed by running means, is a good compromise.</page>
<page dir='es/smoothing' filePrefix='smoothing4'>Exponential smoothing replaces each value with a weighted average of it and previous values. Unlike moving averages, it can be used right up to the end of the series.</page>
<page dir='es/smoothing' filePrefix='smoothing5' note='(advanced)'>An alternative smoothing method that provides smoothed values to both ends of a time series is to obtain the smoothed value from a least squares line fitted to adjacent values.</page>
<page dir='es/smoothing' filePrefix='smoothing6' note='(advanced)'>A similar method can be used to draw a 'smooth' curve to represent a nonlinear relationship on a scatterplot.</page>
