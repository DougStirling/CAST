<page dir='es/prob' filePrefix='prob1'>Bivariate categorical data are modelled as a sample from a population that consists of pairs of categorical values. The joint probability for any pair of categories is their population proportion.</page>
<page dir='es/prob' filePrefix='prob2'>The marginal probabilities for a variable are the population proportions for its possible values. They can be found by summing joint probabilities.</page>
<page dir='es/prob' filePrefix='prob3'>Conditional probabilites for a variable are proportions in a sub-population containing a specific value for the other variable. They are found by scaling the joint probabilities in that sub-population.</page>
<page dir='es/prob' filePrefix='prob4'>Joint, marginal and conditional probabilities can be displayed graphically.</page>
<page dir='es/prob' filePrefix='prob5'>The model can be equivalently described by (a) joint probabilities, (b) marginal probabilites for X and conditional probabilities for Y, or (c) marginal probabilites for Y and conditional probabilities for X. Any of these sets of probabilities can be found any other set.</page>
