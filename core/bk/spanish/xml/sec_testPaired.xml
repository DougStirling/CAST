<page dir='es/testPaired' filePrefix='testPaired1'>Paired data are a type of bivariate data in which two similar measurements are made from each individual. We are usually interested in testing whether the means of both measurements are the same.</page>
<page dir='es/testPaired' filePrefix='testPaired2'>For paired data, differences between the two measurements hold all information about whether the means of both variables are the same.</page>
<page dir='es/testPaired' filePrefix='testPaired3'>Testing for a difference between the means of the measurements is done with an ordinary t-test for whether the mean difference is zero.</page>
<page dir='es/testPaired' filePrefix='testPaired4'>To estimate or test the difference between two means, it is sometimes possible to collect data from two independent samples or from paired units. If the paired units are similar, a pair data gives more accurate results.</page>
