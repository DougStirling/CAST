<page dir="en/probDensity" filePrefix="probDensity5" summaryDir="en/probDensity" summaryFilePrefix="s_probDensity5">Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</page>
<page dir="en/probDensity" filePrefix="probDensity6" summaryDir="en/probDensity" summaryFilePrefix="s_probDensity6">When a value is sampled from an infinite continuous population, the probability that it is between a and b equals the area under the p.d.f. between these two values.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn1" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn1">Normal distributions are sometimes useful as models for data, but the main reason for their importance is that sample means and many other summary statistics have approximately normal distributions.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn2" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn2">All normal distributions look the same on a scale of standard deviations from the mean.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn3" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn3">Normal distributions are centred on their mean and have hardly any area beyond 3 standard deviations on each side. A small area (about 5%) is over 2 standard deviations away from the mean.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn4" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn4">The probabilities of being within (1, 2, and 3) standard deviations of the mean are (0.68, 0.95 and 0.997) for all normal distributions. This is a close match to the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb for numerical data sets.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn5" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn5">Any value, x, can be translated into a z-score that gives the number of standard deviations above the mean.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn6" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn6">Z-scores have a standard normal distribution (mean 0 and s.d. 1). The probability of a value less than x can be translated into a probability about a z-score.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn7" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn7">The probability that X is greater than a specified value or is between two values can also be translated into a probability about a z-score.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn8" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn8">If a computer is not available, tables of probabilities for the standard normal distribution are used to find normal probabilities.</page>
<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="normalDistn9" summaryDir="en/normalDistn" summaryFilePrefix="s_normalDistn9">The inverse problem of finding the x-value corresponding to a given probability is also solved using z-scores. If normal tables are used, they must be looked up differently.</page>
