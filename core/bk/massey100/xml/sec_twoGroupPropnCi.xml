<page dir="en/twoGroupPropn" filePrefix="twoGroupPropn1" summaryDir="en/twoGroupPropn" summaryFilePrefix="s_twoGroupPropn1">Two-group categorical data can be modelled as samples from two categorical populations with different probabilities of 'success'.</page>
<page dir="en/twoGroupPropn" filePrefix="twoGroupPropn2" summaryDir="en/twoGroupPropn" summaryFilePrefix="s_twoGroupPropn2">The difference between two sample proportions has a distribution that is approximately normal and whose parameters can be estimated using earlier results about the mean and standard deviation of differences.</page>
<page dir="en/twoGroupPropn" filePrefix="twoGroupPropn3" summaryDir="en/twoGroupPropn" summaryFilePrefix="s_twoGroupPropn3">The standard deviation of the difference between two sample proportions can be estimated. From this, a 95% confidence interval is developed for the difference between two probabilities.</page>
