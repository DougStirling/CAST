  <p>The concept of probability is closely related to the idea of proportion in 
    a data set. The <strong>probability</strong> that a randomly chosen person 
    from a group has black hair is equal to the proportion of people in a group 
    with this hair colour.</p>
  <p>Probability is used to describe any situation where the observed outcome 
    is random. Probability has characteristics that are described in this chapter.</p>
  <p>A consequence of the randomness of data is that summary statistics such as 
    sample means and proportions are also random and have distributions.</p>
