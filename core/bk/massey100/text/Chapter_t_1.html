<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; Data and Distributions</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Context</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Importance of context</h3>
<p>The focus of statistics is to answer questions that are expressed in the language of some application area. Statistical methods for analysis of data are a core part of statistics, but the context of the data is most important.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; Statistics</h3>
<p>Statistical analysis is a process that involves identifying the questions of interest, data collection and analysis and producing a report. In real-life problems, the data collection and analysis steps may be repeated more than once.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; The statistical process</h3>
<p>In many applications, the cycle of data collection and analysis is a central part of the quest for improvement to systems and processes.</p>
<h2>1.2 &nbsp; Standard data structures</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 &nbsp; Variables and individuals</h3>
<p>Most data sets contain one or more measurements from each of a collection of 'individuals' (also called 'cases' or 'units').</p>
<h3>1.2.2 &nbsp; Types of variable</h3>
<p>Variables are classified into numerical and categorical variables. A finer classification is also sketched.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 &nbsp; Categorical variables and groups</h3>
<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the 'individuals' into groups. Equivalently, grouped data can be represented in a data matrix with a categorical variable. </p>
<h2>1.3 &nbsp; Variation</h2>
<h3>1.3.1 &nbsp; Signal and noise</h3>
<p>In many situations, information (signal) can be obscured by random variation (noise).</p>
<h3>1.3.2 &nbsp; Natural variability</h3>
<p>When data are collected from 'individuals', they often vary considerably.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 &nbsp; Variability caused by experiments</h3>
<p>Intentional differences to experimental conditions may also cause systematic differences in variables. Natural variability makes it harder to interpret experimental results.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 &nbsp; Variability in survey data</h3>
<p>The natural variability of individuals also makes it harder to interpret information from surveys.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 &nbsp; Explained and unexplained variation</h3>
<p>Some variation in a variable can be explained in terms of other recorded variables. Other variation is a result of natural variability in the individuals.</p>
<h3>1.3.6 &nbsp; Predicting future variation</h3>
<p>Variation in a data set can help us to predict the  values that might occur if further data of the same kind are collected in the future.</p>
<h2>1.4 &nbsp; Graphical display of values</h2>
<h3>1.4.1 &nbsp; Analysing variation</h3>
<p>Meaningful information can be obtained from variation in the values of a variable.</p>
<h3>1.4.2 &nbsp; Basic dot plot</h3>
<p>A dot plot displays each value as a cross along a numerical axis</p>
<h3>1.4.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h3>
<p>Jittering is a modification to the basic dot plot that avoids some problems associated with overlapping crosses</p>
<h3>1.4.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h3>
<p>Stacking of the crosses is an alternative to jittering that highlights ranges of high or low density.</p>
<h3>1.4.5 &nbsp; Stem and leaf plots</h3>
<p>Stem and leaf plots are similar to stacked dot plots, but a digit is used instead of a cross to retain extra information.</p>
<h3>1.4.6 &nbsp; Splitting the stems</h3>
<p>To increase the flexibility of the display, each stem may be repeated either 2 or 5 times, increasing the number of classes in the basic stem and leaf plot by a factor of 2 or 5.</p>
<h2>1.5 &nbsp; Histograms and density</h2>
<h3>1.5.1 &nbsp; Density of values</h3>
<p>The heights of the stacks of crosses in a dot plot describe the density of values.</p>
<h3>1.5.2 &nbsp; Histogram with equal class widths</h3>
<p>In a simple histogram, the height of the rectangle above each class on the axis equals the number of values in the class -- the class frequency.</p>
<h3>1.5.3 &nbsp; Choice of classes</h3>
<p>Class width and start-point should be chosen to make the histogram as smooth as possible -- neither too blocky nor too jagged.</p>
<h3>1.5.4 &nbsp; Histograms of small data sets</h3>
<p>The shape of a histogram can be very dependent on the choice of classes if the data set is small; beware over-interpreting its shape. Stacked dot plots are a better display of small data sets.</p>
<h3>1.5.5 &nbsp; Relative frequency and area</h3>
<p>In a histogram, the proportion of the total area that is above any class equals the relative frequency of the class.</p>
<h3>1.5.6 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h3>
<p>The vertical axis should be relative frequency, not frequency, when comparing two groups with histograms. Population pyramids are often used to compare age distributions.</p>
<h3>1.5.7 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h3>
<p>If a histogram has varying class widths, the vertical axis must be 'density'. The histogram shape would be misleading if frequency or relative frequency was used for the vertical axis.</p>
<h3>1.5.8 &nbsp; Understanding histograms</h3>
<p>The proportion of values in any classes always equals the proportion of the total histogram area that is above the classes.</p>
<h2>1.6 &nbsp; Discrete data (counts)</h2>
<h3>1.6.1 &nbsp; Discrete and continuous data</h3>
<p>Discrete data sets contain counts whereas continuous data sets could potentially contain any values within an interval. Stacked dot plots are good displays of small discrete data sets containing small counts.</p>
<h3>1.6.2 &nbsp; Histograms for counts</h3>
<p>When the range of possible counts is moderate or large, a histogram is an effective display of the distribution. Class width should be a whole number and class boundaries should end in '.5'.</p>
<h3>1.6.3 &nbsp; Bar charts</h3>
<p>When the range of possible counts is small, a bar chart is a better representation of the data than a histogram.</p>
<h2>1.7 &nbsp; Displaying categorical values</h2>
<h3>1.7.1 &nbsp; Frequency tables</h3>
<p>A frequency table holds all information about the distribution of a categorical variable.</p>
<h3>1.7.2 &nbsp; Proportions and percentages</h3>
<p>The proportions or percentages of values are usually easier to interpret than the raw frequencies.</p>
<h3>1.7.3 &nbsp; Bar charts</h3>
<p>A bar chart displays the frequencies in a frequency table graphically.</p>
<h3>1.7.4 &nbsp; Pareto diagrams</h3>
<p>For barcharts of categorical data whose categories have no natural ordering, it is often helpful to sort the categories into decreasing frequencies.</p>
<h3>1.7.5 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts and pie charts</h3>
<p>These are alternatives to a bar chart for categorical data.</p>
<h2>1.8 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2>
<h3>1.8.1 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</p>
<h3>1.8.2 &nbsp; Probability and area under the pdf</h3>
<p>When a value is sampled from an infinite continuous population, the probability that it is between a and b equals the area under the p.d.f. between these two values.</p>
<h3>1.8.3 &nbsp; Importance of normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are sometimes useful as models for data, but the main reason for their importance is that sample means and many other summary statistics have approximately normal distributions.</p>
<h3>1.8.4 &nbsp; Shape of normal distributions</h3>
<p>All normal distributions look the same on a scale of standard deviations from the mean.</p>
<h3>1.8.5 &nbsp; Sketching a normal distribution</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are centred on their mean and have hardly any area beyond 3 standard deviations on each side. A small area (about 5%) is over 2 standard deviations away from the mean.</p>
<h3>1.8.6 &nbsp; Some normal probabilities</h3>
<p>The probabilities of being within (1, 2, and 3) standard deviations of the mean are (0.68, 0.95 and 0.997) for all normal distributions. This is a close match to the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb for numerical data sets.</p>
<h3>1.8.7 &nbsp; Z-scores</h3>
<p>Any value, x, can be translated into a z-score that gives the number of standard deviations above the mean.</p>
<h3>1.8.8 &nbsp; Finding normal probabilities</h3>
<p>Z-scores have a standard normal distribution (mean 0 and s.d. 1). The probability of a value less than x can be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>1.8.9 &nbsp; Other probabilities</h3>
<p>The probability that X is greater than a specified value or is between two values can also be translated into a probability about a z-score.</p>
<h3>1.8.10 &nbsp; Normal tables</h3>
<p>If a computer is not available, tables of probabilities for the standard normal distribution are used to find normal probabilities.</p>
<h3>1.8.11 &nbsp; Finding normal quantiles</h3>
<p>The inverse problem of finding the x-value corresponding to a given probability is also solved using z-scores. If normal tables are used, they must be looked up differently.</p>
