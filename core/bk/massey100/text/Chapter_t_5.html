<h1>Chapter 5 &nbsp; Probability &amp; Sampling Distns</h1>
<h2>5.1 &nbsp; Probability and probability density</h2>
<h3>5.1.1 &nbsp; Properties of probability</h3>
<p>This page describes some rules that are satisfied by probabilities.</p>
<h2>5.2 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h2>
<h3>5.2.1 &nbsp; Contingency tables</h3>
<p>Categorical data collected from different groups can be shown in a contingency table. It contains a simple frequency table for each group.</p>
<h3>5.2.2 &nbsp; Contingency table examples</h3>
<p>Contingency tables sometimes arise from experiments. Data collected from surveys are often presented in contingency tables.</p>
<h3>5.2.3 &nbsp; Bar charts using proportions</h3>
<p>It is easier to compare groups if bar charts are drawn from the proportions within each group rather than the frequencies.</p>
<h3>5.2.4 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts</h3>
<p>Stacking the bars in each bar chart makes it easier to compare groups. Stacked bar charts are particularly effective for ordinal categorical data.</p>
<h3>5.2.5 &nbsp; Two special cases</h3>
<p>When the variable has only two categories, stacked bar charts can be simplified. An example is also given where the grouping forms a time series.</p>
<h2>5.3 &nbsp; Bivariate categorical distributions</h2>
<h3>5.3.1 &nbsp; Relationships between variables</h3>
<p>If two categorical variables can be treated as a response and explanatory variable, the explanatory variable can be used to split the individuals into groups. If neither variable can be treated as explanatory, we need other ways to describe their association.</p>
<h3>5.3.2 &nbsp; 3-dimensional bar charts</h3>
<p>Bivariate distributions can be displayed in 3-dimensional bar charts but there are better ways to show the data.</p>
<h3>5.3.3 &nbsp; Clustered bar charts</h3>
<p>A 2-dimensional bar chart can be used to display the joint distribution of two categorical variables, with the bars clustered by one or other of the variables.</p>
<h3>5.3.4 &nbsp; Marginal distributions</h3>
<p>The two marginal distributions are found by adding the joint frequencies (or proportions) across rows or down columns of a contingency table.</p>
<h3>5.3.5 &nbsp; Conditional distributions</h3>
<p>Conditional distributions are obtained by scaling the rows (or columns) of a contingency table to make them all sum to 1.0.</p>
<h3>5.3.6 &nbsp; More about conditional distributions</h3>
<p>Be careful to distinguish between the conditional distribution of Y given X, and that of X given Y.</p>
<h3>5.3.7 &nbsp; Conditional vs marginal distns</h3>
<p>Proportional Venn diagrams are a useful way to display joint distributions and to understand the relationships between conditional and marginal distributions.</p>
<h2>5.4 &nbsp; Probability and applications</h2>
<h3>5.4.1 &nbsp; Joint probabilities</h3>
<p>Bivariate categorical data are modelled as a sample from a population that consists of pairs of categorical values. The joint probability for any pair of categories is their population proportion.</p>
<h3>5.4.2 &nbsp; Marginal probabilities</h3>
<p>The marginal probabilities for a variable are the population proportions for its possible values. They can be found by summing joint probabilities.</p>
<h3>5.4.3 &nbsp; Conditional probabilities</h3>
<p>Conditional probabilites for a variable are proportions in a sub-population containing a specific value for the other variable. They are found by scaling the joint probabilities in that sub-population.</p>
<h3>5.4.4 &nbsp; Graphical display of probabilities</h3>
<p>Joint, marginal and conditional probabilities can be displayed graphically.</p>
<h3>5.4.5 &nbsp; Calculations with probabilities</h3>
<p>The model can be equivalently described by (a) joint probabilities, (b) marginal probabilites for X and conditional probabilities for Y, or (c) marginal probabilites for Y and conditional probabilities for X. Any of these sets of probabilities can be found any other set.</p>
<h2>5.5 &nbsp; Distribution of sample mean</h2>
<h3>5.5.1 &nbsp; Parameters and statistics</h3>
<p>A summary value describing a population is called a parameter and the corresponding value in a sample is called a statistic. Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.</p>
<h3>5.5.2 &nbsp; Variability of sample mean</h3>
<p>A sample mean has a distribution that is centred round the population mean but has smaller spread than the population.</p>
<h3>5.5.3 &nbsp; Standard devn of sample mean</h3>
<p>The spread of the sample mean decreases as sample size increases. A formula is given for the standard deviation of the sample mean in terms of the sample size and population standard deviation.</p>
<h3>5.5.4 &nbsp; Means from normal populations</h3>
<p>Sample means from normal populations also have normal distributions.</p>
<h3>5.5.5 &nbsp; Large-sample normality of means</h3>
<p>The shape of the sample mean's distribution is usually close to normal, even if the population distribution is skew or multimodal. The bigger the sample size, the closer the distribution to normal.</p>
<h3>5.5.6 &nbsp; Distribution of mean from a sample</h3>
<p>It is possible to estimate the distribution of a sample mean from a single sample.</p>
<h3>5.5.7 &nbsp; Requirement of independence</h3>
<p>If the sample values are positively correlated, the standard deviation of the mean will be underestimated.</p>
<h3>5.5.8 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations</h3>
<p>If a random sample is selected without replacement, the formula for the standard deviation of the sample mean must be modified.</p>
<h2>5.6 &nbsp; Distribution of sample proportion</h2>
<h3>5.6.1 &nbsp; Proportion and probability</h3>
<p>The population proportion in a category is called its probability. Proportions and probabilities can be obtained from categorical and numerical variables.</p>
<h3>5.6.2 &nbsp; Properties of counts and proportions</h3>
<p>The sample proportion is a statistic that varies from sample to sample. The sample count in a category is also random with a discrete distribution.</p>
<h3>5.6.3 &nbsp; Binomial distribution</h3>
<p>The sample count in a category has a standard distribution called a binomial distribution with parameters n and Ï€.</p>
<h3>5.6.4 &nbsp; Binomial probability examples</h3>
<p>The binomial distribution can be used to find probabilities relating to sample counts.</p>
<h3>5.6.5 &nbsp; Normal approximation to binomial</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, the distribution of the sample count in a category becomes close to a normal distribution.</p>
<h3>5.6.6 &nbsp; Normal approximation examples</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find binomial probabilities.</p>
