<p class="heading">What is the purpose of Statistics?</p>
<p>When non-statisticians think of statistics, the first thing that usually 
	comes to mind is data. Large amounts of economic, social and administrative data
are routinely collected and published. Most researchers also collect data. Statistical
analysis uses data, but <strong>the data are not the goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Data are the basic commodity of the statistics. Without data, there is no 
	information on which to reach conclusions or base decisions.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data contain information.<br>
<strong>The purpose of statistics is to extract information from data.</strong></p>
</div></div>
<p>Large data sets must be summarised before patterns and relationships can 
	be seen. In smaller data sets, the problem 
	is usually that there is not enough information to get a clear answer to questions
of importance. Statistical methods are needed to describe precision and to ensure
that the highest precision is obtained.</p>
<p class="heading">Context</p>
<p>In general, <strong>users</strong> of statistics are neither interested in data
or in statistical methods, but are only interested in questions <strong>in their
own subject area</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The aim of statistics is to supply useful information to people whose 
	main area of expertise is <span class="red">not</span> statistics.</strong>	Statistical methods are only useful if they can extract information from data 
	to help answer discipline-specific questions. The underlying context is therefore 
	the most important aspect of any statistical analysis.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><strong>If you are not primarily 
			a statistician, you will appreciate statistical methods when they are 
needed in your career!</strong></p>
</div></div>


<h2 class="pageName">1.1.2 &nbsp; Statistics</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Simple series of steps</p>
<p>The simplest application of statistics addresses a single question in 
	the context of some practical subject area.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/simpleProcess.gif" width="384" height="275"></p>
	<p>Statistics has a role to play in all stages of this process.</p>
	<p class="heading">Feedback</p>
	<p>The initial question is usually less well defined and a single 
		pass through the process is not enough. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/feedbackProcess.gif" width="324" height="275"></p>
<p>An example of feedback arises when 
		a small fraction of the data is initially collected and analysed. The information 
		obtained from this <strong>pilot study</strong> is used to refine the data 
collection process.</p>
<p>Another example of feedback  occurs when the initial 
		analysis reveals unusual or unexpected features in the data. Such features 
	may suggest further questions and therefore further data collection.</p>

		


<h2 class="pageName">1.1.3 &nbsp; The statistical process</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Continuous quality improvement</p>
	<p>Statistical analysis is an important part of long-term <strong>monitoring</strong> and <strong>improvement</strong> of
the performance of many types of system. This process is often called <strong>continuous
quality improvement</strong>.</p>
<p>The statistical part of the process again involves a feedback cycle of data collection and analysis, aimed at improving aspects of the system.
</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/context/images/pdca.gif" width="463" height="265"></p>
	<p>The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle is most often used in commerce and industry, but
can also be used to 'improve'  many biological and other systems.</p>

<p>These three data sets  have the <strong>same basic structure</strong>, so the
same statistical methods  can be applied to all of them. </p>
<p class="heading">Variables and 'individuals'</p>
<p>Most data sets have a fairly simple structure. One or more measurements (<strong>'variables'</strong>)
are recorded from each of a collection of '<strong>individuals</strong>' (also called <strong>'cases'</strong> or
 '<strong><strong>units</strong></strong>'). The data can 
be presented in a  <strong>data matrix</strong>. </p>
<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="../../../en/structures/images/dataMatrix.gif" width="258" height="283"> </p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.2 &nbsp; Types of variable</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p>Most variables in a data set are either numerical or categorical.</p>
<p class=heading>Numerical variables</p>
<p>These have values that are <strong>numbers</strong> and can 
	be further classified into:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Discrete numerical variable</dt>
	<dd>A variable whose values are <strong>whole numbers</strong> (counts) is 
		called discrete.</dd>
	<dt>Continuous numerical variable</dt>
	<dd>A variable that may contain <strong>any value within some range</strong> is called continuous.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Statistical methods that can be used for continuous variables are not always 
	appropriate for discrete variables.</p>
<p class=heading>Categorical variables</p>
<p>The values of a <strong>categorical</strong> variable are selected from a 
	small group of categories. A further classification is:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Ordinal categorical variable</dt>
	<dd>This arises when the  categories can be<strong> meaningfully ordered</strong>.</dd>
	<dt>Nominal categorical variable</dt>
	<dd>If it does not matter which way its categories are ordered, the variable is
called nominal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most statistical methods for categorical data can be applied to both ordinal 
	and nominal variables.</p>
<p class=heading>Labels</p>
<p>In some data sets, each individual has a unique 'name' that can be used to 
	identify it. We call this a <strong>label variable</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading><span class="blue">Warning!</span></p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When you see a column of numbers in your data matrix, do not 
			assume that it is a numerical variable.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Numbers are sometimes used as <strong>codes</strong> for categorical or label variables.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.2.3 &nbsp; Categorical variables and groups</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Categorical variables and groups</p>
	<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the individuals in a data set 
	into <strong>groups</strong>. We might treat  individuals with values &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;,
etc. as belonging to different groups.</p>
	<p>Conversely, if data were separately collected from different groups of individuals, 
		the resulting data sets could be combined with a categorical variable distinguishing 
		between the groups. Its values might be defined as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, etc. to identify the group membership of any individual.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A categorical variable and groups are often two ways of representing
the same data.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Data presented in a separate list for each group are  called <strong>unstacked</strong>
whereas if the data are presented
as a single list alongside a categorical variable, they are called <strong>stacked</strong>.</p>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Signal and noise</p>
	<p>Electronics and telecommunications engineers distinguish between the <strong>signal</strong> that is being communicated between two locations and the random <strong>noise</strong> that is added by the communications channel. The noise degrades the signal 
		and, in the worst cases, can make the signal difficult to detect.</p>

<h2 class="pageName">1.5.7 &nbsp; Histograms with varying class widths</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading notPrinted">Mixed class widths</p>
<p>For some data sets, wider classes give a smoother histogram in some ranges of values (e.g. in the tail of a distribution) and narrower classes are better in other parts of the distribution (usually where there is greater density of values).</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p> In a correctly drawn histogram, each value contributes the same area. </p>

	<p>Any  probability (area) relating to a normally distributed random variable, <em>X</em>, can be expressed in terms of z-scores:</p>

	<p>Areas under the standard normal curve can be evaluated in Excel and most statistical programs. Statistical tables can also be used (see later).</p>




<h2 class="pageName">1.8.9 &nbsp; Other probabilities</h2><!DOCTYPE HTML>


<p class="heading">Evaluating other probabilities</p>
	<p>Other probabilities about normal distributions can be found using the following properties:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The total area under a normal p.d.f. is 1</li>
		<li>The probability of a value in any interval is the area under the normal p.d.f. above this interval.</li>

	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/normalDistn/images/normalAreas2.gif" width="506" height="241"></p>
