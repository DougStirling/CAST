<h1>Chapter 6 &nbsp; Quality and Reliability</h1>
<h2>6.1 &nbsp; Control charts</h2>
<h3>6.1.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>Many business and industrial processes are continuously monitored in order to detect problems early.</p>
<h3>6.1.2 &nbsp; Run charts</h3>
<p>A run chart plots regular measurements from a process against time. Extreme values indicate problems with the process.</p>
<h3>6.1.3 &nbsp; Control limits</h3>
<p>For most distributions, almost all values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Control limits 3s on each side of the sample mean from training data can be used to indicate problems with the process.</p>
<h3>6.1.4 &nbsp; Other signals of being out-of-control</h3>
<p>Runs of successive values that are s or 2s from the mean can also be used to indicate problems in the process.</p>
<h3>6.1.5 &nbsp; False alarms</h3>
<p>False alarms occasionally happen even when the process is in control. Several successive triggers give a clearer indication of problems.</p>
<h3>6.1.6 &nbsp; Examples of run charts</h3>
<p>Control limits are set from variation when a process is under control then applied to future observations.</p>
<h3>6.1.7 &nbsp; Control charts for means</h3>
<p>Control charts are often based on regular small samples rather than individual values. If individual values have a skew distribution, the +/-ï¿½3s limits may be exceeded in 2% or more of values. Sample means are closer to normal, so a control chart for means rarely exceeds its control limits when the process is under control.</p>
<h3>6.1.8 &nbsp; Control charts for ranges</h3>
<p>A control chart for the range of successive samples can indicate increases in process variability.</p>
<h3>6.1.9 &nbsp; Finding the cause of problems</h3>
<p>If a problem is detected in a process, brainstorming and cause-and-effect diagrams can help to determine the cause of the problem.</p>
