<h1>Chapter 8 &nbsp; Testing Hypotheses</h1>
<h2>8.1 &nbsp; Introduction to hypothesis tests</h2>
<h3>8.1.1 &nbsp; Inference</h3>
<p>Estimation asks which values for an unknown parameter are consistent with data that have been collected. Hypothesis testing usually asks whether the data are consistent with some parameter values.</p>
<h3>8.1.2 &nbsp; Soccer league simulation</h3>
<p>Are some teams in a soccer league better than others, or is the end-of-season league table consistent with random results from equally-matched teams? A simulation can help to answer this question.</p>
<h3>8.1.3 &nbsp; Simulation to test a proportion</h3>
<p>This page presents a simulation to test whether the number of observations observed in one category is consistent with a specified probability.</p>
<h3>8.1.4 &nbsp; Test for a mean</h3>
<p>This page uses a simulation to test whether a sample is consistent with a particular population mean.</p>
<h3>8.1.5 &nbsp; Randomisation tests</h3>
<p>A method is presented to assess whether the population means in two groups are the same.</p>
<h3>8.1.6 &nbsp; Randomisation test for correlation</h3>
<p>The correlation between teams' final points in two successive seasons will be relatively high if some teams are better than others. Randomising points in the second season gives an indication of whether the actual correlation is unusually high.</p>
<h3>8.1.7 &nbsp; Common patterns in tests</h3>
<p>All hypothesis tests involve a null hypothesis, a summary statistic for testing, an alternative hypothesis and a p-value.</p>
<h2>8.2 &nbsp; Tests about proportions</h2>
<h3>8.2.1 &nbsp; Inference about parameters</h3>
<p>When the data are a random sample, the null and alternative hypotheses are usually expressed in terms of population parameters. For categorical samples, the hypotheses refer to the probabilities of the categories.</p>
<h3>8.2.2 &nbsp; P-value for testing proportion</h3>
<p>The p-value for testing a proportion is the probability of getting such an 'extreme' number of successes when the null hypothesis holds. It can be found from the binomial distribution.</p>
<h3>8.2.3 &nbsp; Another example</h3>
<p>An example shows how to use a binomial distribution to find the p-value for a test.</p>
<h3>8.2.4 &nbsp; One- and two-tailed tests</h3>
<p>If values in both tails of the binomial distribution support the alternative hypothesis, the tail probability must be doubled to give the p-value for the test.</p>
<h3>8.2.5 &nbsp; Normal approximation</h3>
<p>When the sample size is large, a normal approximation to the binomial distribution can be used to find the p-value for a hypothesis test.</p>
<h3>8.2.6 &nbsp; Statistical distance</h3>
<p>The statistical distance between an estimate and hypothesised parameter value is the difference divided by the standard error of the estimate. It should have approximately a standard normal distribution if the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<h3>8.2.7 &nbsp; Tests based on statistical distance</h3>
<p>The p-value for testing a proportion can be evaluated as a tail area of a standard normal distribution corresponding to values more 'extreme' than the statistical distance between p and π.</p>
<h2>8.3 &nbsp; Tests about means</h2>
<h3>8.3.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>For numerical populations, the null and alternative hypotheses usually specify values for the population mean. Tests are based on the sample mean.</p>
<h3>8.3.2 &nbsp; Test for mean (known σ)</h3>
<p>If the population standard deviation is known, the distribution of the sample mean can be found when the null hypothesis is true. The p-value for the test is a tail area of this distribution.</p>
<h3>8.3.3 &nbsp; P-value from statistical distance</h3>
<p>The p-value is most easily found from the 'statistical distance' between the sample and hypothesised means. The p-value can be found as a tail area of the standard normal distribution and is approximately correct even when the population distribution is not normal.</p>
<h3>8.3.4 &nbsp; The t distribution</h3>
<p>When the population standard deviation is unknown, a different test statistic must be used. It has a standard distribution known as a t distribution.</p>
<h3>8.3.5 &nbsp; The t test for a mean</h3>
<p>The t distribution is used to obtain a p-value for tests about a population mean when the standard deviation is unknown.</p>
<h2>8.4 &nbsp; Comparing means in two groups</h2>
<h3>8.4.1 &nbsp; Testing a hypothesis</h3>
<p>A hypothesis test is developed for testing whether two group means are the same.</p>
<h3>8.4.2 &nbsp; One-tailed tests for differences</h3>
<p>If the alternative hypothesis is for one particular mean to be greater, then the p-value for the test is found from only one tail of the t distribution.</p>
<h2>8.5 &nbsp; Comparing two proportions</h2>
<h3>8.5.1 &nbsp; Testing for difference in probabilities</h3>
<p>A hypothesis test is developed to assess whether two population probabilities are the same.</p>
<h2>8.6 &nbsp; Paired t test</h2>
<h3>8.6.1 &nbsp; Paired t-test</h3>
<p>Testing for a difference between the means of the measurements is done with an ordinary t-test for whether the mean difference is zero.</p>
<h3>8.6.2 &nbsp; Pairing and experimental design</h3>
<p>To estimate or test the difference between two means, it is sometimes possible to collect data from two independent samples or from paired units. If the paired units are similar, a pair data gives more accurate results.</p>
