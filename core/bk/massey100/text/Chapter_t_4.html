<h1>Chapter 4 &nbsp; Obtaining Data</h1>
<h2>4.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h3>
<p>A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h3>
<p>A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h3>
<p>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</p>
<h3>4.1.4 &nbsp; Sampling error and sample size</h3>
<p>As the sample size is increased, the sampling error becomes smaller. </p>
<h3>4.1.5 &nbsp; Sampling from finite populations</h3>
<p>Sampling with replacement from a finite population permits the same value to be selected two or more times. Sampling without replacement ensures that there are no such duplicates.</p>
<h3>4.1.6 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h3>
<p>Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</p>
<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Samples from distributions</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Data as representatives</h3>
<p>We often have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data are collected. The data are representative of some wider situation and we want to generalise from the data to describe features of this more general situation.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h3>
<p>If data collection was repeated, perhaps from different individuals, the values would be different. All such data sets should give similar but not identical information. Interpretation of a data set should take into account this randomness.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; Model to explain randomness</h3>
<p>Many data sets are not generated as random samples from real finite populations. However it is often useful to treat the data as a random sample from some abstract population containing the measurements that might have been recorded.</p>
<h3>4.2.4 &nbsp; Infinite populations (distributions)</h3>
<p>The populations that are imagined to underly data often contain an infinite number of values and are called distributions.</p>
<h3>4.2.5 &nbsp; Information from a sample</h3>
<p>The mechanism of sampling from a population explains randomness. Although the population is unknown and we only have a single sample, the sample provides information about the population.</p>
<h2>4.3 &nbsp; Probability &amp; probability density</h2>
<h3>4.3.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h3>
<p>When randomly selecting one value from a population of N different values, the probability of getting any individual value is 1/N. More generally, the probability of sampling a value in any range is the proportion of population values in the range.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 &nbsp; Probabilities with infinite populations</h3>
<p>The probability of any type of value is again the proportion of such values in the population. It can also be interpreted as the limiting proportion from a sample of values if the sample size is increased indefinitely.</p>
<h3>4.3.3 &nbsp; Bar charts of discrete probabilities</h3>
<p>Infinite categorical or discrete populations can be described by bar charts of the probabilities.</p>
<h3>4.3.4 &nbsp; Probability density functions</h3>
<p>Infinite continuous numerical populations are described with a type of histogram called a probability density function.</p>
<h3>4.3.5 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are infinite continuous populations. A normal distribution is symmetric and its two parameters, µ and σ, can be adjusted to alter the distribution's location and spread.</p>
<h3>4.3.6 &nbsp; Probability and area under the pdf</h3>
<p>When a value is sampled from an infinite continuous population, the probability that it is between a and b equals the area under the p.d.f. between these two values.</p>
<h3>4.3.7 &nbsp; Properties of probability</h3>
<p>This page describes some rules that are obeyed by probabilities.</p>
<h2>4.4 &nbsp; Sampling in practice</h2>
<h3>4.4.1 &nbsp; Stratified sampling</h3>
<p>More accurate estimates can sometimes be obtained by taking separate random samples within different parts of the population.</p>
<h3>4.4.2 &nbsp; Cluster sampling</h3>
<p>When individuals are grouped in clusters, it is often cheaper to sample complete clusters rather than separate individuals.</p>
<h3>4.4.3 &nbsp; Two-stage sampling</h3>
<p>When the target population is spread over a wide area, it may be cheaper to take a sample from only a few regions (groups of individuals), than to sample from all the regions.</p>
<h3>4.4.4 &nbsp; Sampling and non-sampling errors</h3>
<p>Samples are usually collected to estimate population characteristics. The ordinary variation caused by the sampling scheme is called sampling error. Practical difficulties with conducting the survey can cause biased estimates (non-sampling errors).</p>
<h3>4.4.5 &nbsp; Coverage and non-response errors</h3>
<p>Coverage error and non-response error prevent some individuals being included in the sample.</p>
<h3>4.4.6 &nbsp; Interviewer and instrument errors</h3>
<p>Interviewer error and instrument error can result in 'incorrect' measurements from the sampled individuals.</p>
<h3>4.4.7 &nbsp; Survey design issues</h3>
<p>Survey information is collected by a variety of mechanisms, from mailed questionnaires to telephone. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h2>4.5 &nbsp; Association &amp; causal relationships</h2>
<h3>4.5.1 &nbsp; Interest in relationships</h3>
<p>For most data sets, we are interested in understanding the relationships between the variables. However interpreting relationships must be done with care.</p>
<h3>4.5.2 &nbsp; Causal and non-causal relationships</h3>
<p>If the relationship between X and Y is causal, it is possible to predict the effect of changing the value of X.</p>
<h3>4.5.3 &nbsp; Detecting causal relationships</h3>
<p>Causality can only be deduced from how the data were collected — the data values themselves do not contain any information about causality.</p>
<h3>4.5.4 &nbsp; Observational and experimental data</h3>
<p>In an observational study, values are passively recorded from individuals. Experiments are characterised by the experimenter's control over the values of one or more variables.</p>
<h3>4.5.5 &nbsp; Data collection and causality</h3>
<p>Causal relationships can only be deduced from well-designed experiments.</p>
<h2>4.6 &nbsp; Principles of experimental design</h2>
<h3>4.6.1 &nbsp; Experiments and treatments</h3>
<p>Experiments are conducted to assess the effect of some categorical or numerical explanatory variable on a response. Experiments are characterised by the fact that the researcher can control the values of the explanatory variable that are used.</p>
<h3>4.6.2 &nbsp; Variable experimental units</h3>
<p>In many experiments, the units on which the experiment is conducted are not identical. The varying characteristics of the experimental units may affect the response.</p>
<h3>4.6.3 &nbsp; A badly designed experiment</h3>
<p>If the treatments are badly allocated to experimental units, the experiment may over- or under-estimate their effect.</p>
<h3>4.6.4 &nbsp; Confounding</h3>
<p>If the experimental units that are chosen to get one treatment also differ in other ways, it will be impossible to tell whether it is the treatment or the other distinct characteristics of the units that affects the response.</p>
<h3>4.6.5 &nbsp; Randomisation</h3>
<p>Random allocation of treatments to experimental units avoids systematic over- or under-estimation of treatment effects.</p>
<h3>4.6.6 &nbsp; Replication</h3>
<p>If each treatment is used in more than one experimental unit, unit-to-unit variability can be assessed. This gives information about whether differences between the treatments are more than chance differences.</p>
<h3>4.6.7 &nbsp; Blocking</h3>
<p>By grouping similar experimental units into blocks and randomly allocating treatments within blocks, the treatment effects can be estimated more accurately.</p>
<h2>4.7 &nbsp; Practical issues in design</h2>
<h3>4.7.1 &nbsp; Purpose</h3>
<p>Why is the experiment being conducted and how will the results be used?</p>
<h3>4.7.2 &nbsp; Experimental units and measurements</h3>
<p>In an experiment, what experimental units will be used? What response variable will be recorded? Which variables will be controlled?</p>
<h3>4.7.3 &nbsp; Experiments with human subjects</h3>
<p>Other practical issues are involved when conducting experiments on human subjects.</p>
