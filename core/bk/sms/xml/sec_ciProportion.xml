<page dir="en/normalDistn" filePrefix="e_normalDistn7">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb gives the approximate probability of a value within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. This exercise uses this rule of thumb to find some normal probabilities without formal calculations.</page>
<page dir="en/randomMean" filePrefix="e_randomMean1">This exercise shows the distribution of the mean or sum of values from samples of different sizes from a normal population. You must match the distributions with their sample sizes.</page>
<page dir="en/randomMean" filePrefix="e_randomMean2">This exercise examines understanding of the limiting normal distribution of the sample mean and sum as sample size increases, whatever the shape of the population distribution.</page>
<page dir="en/randomMean" filePrefix="e_randomMean3">In this exercise, pop-up menus are used to specify the centre, spread and skewness of the distribution of a sample mean, sample sum or a single value, given the population distribution.</page>
<page dir="en/estPropn" filePrefix="e_estPropn1">A template is provided in this exercise to help evaluate the standard error of a sample proportion.</page>
<page dir="en/estPropn" filePrefix="e_estPropn2">This exercise gives practice at evaluating an approximate 95% confidence interval for a probability.</page>
<page dir="en/estPropn" filePrefix="e_estPropn3">This exercise requests a mixture of 90%, 95% and 99% confidence intervals for a probability. A normal density can be used to find the relevant z-score and a template helps evaluate the 'plus-minus' value.</page>
<page dir="en/estPropn" filePrefix="e_estPropn4">This exercise asks how the sample size, confidence level and population probability affect the width of a CI for the probability.</page>
<page dir="en/estPropn" filePrefix="e_estPropn5">This exercise presents 3 different statements about a 95% confidence interval and asks which is correct.</page>
