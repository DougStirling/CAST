<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread4">In this exercise, general knowledge about the type of measurement is enough to roughly guess the value of the standard deviation.</page>
<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread5">The mean and standard deviation of a data set should give you a good idea of the likely distribution of values. The first exercise in this page asks you to sketch a stacked dot plot to match a given mean and standard deviation. In the second, a histogram should be drawn.</page>
<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread6">The two exercises on this page ask the effect of combining different groups of values or adding an outlier on the mean and standard deviation.</page>
