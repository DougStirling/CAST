<section name="Introducing CAST exercises">
<topText><![CDATA[<p>Three simple exercises are provided.  Their inclusion here is partly to introduce you to the way of taking them.  If you are unclear what to do, then choose &quot;Tell me&quot; and CAST will do the exercise for you.  Then you can try further examples of the same exercise for yourself.</p>]]></topText>



<page dir="en/freqTable" filePrefix="e_freqTable1">In this exercise, you will classify various measurements as numerical (continuous or discrete) or categorical (ordinal or nominal).</page>
<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread2">An exercise requests estimates of the mean and median from different skew and symmetric stacked dot plots.</page>

<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread4" note="(Optional)#(Optional at this stage!)">In this exercise, general knowledge about the type of measurement should be enough for you to roughly guess the value of the standard deviation. (This exercise is repeated in Topic 6, when it is no longer optional!)</page>
