<page dir="en/leastSqrs" filePrefix="e_leastSqrs2">This exercise shows the equation of a straight line and asks you to sketch it.</page>
<page dir="en/leastSqrs" filePrefix="e_leastSqrs3">The exercises on this page do the inverse of the previous exercise -- you are shown a straight line and asked to find its equation.</page>
<page dir="en/leastSqrs" filePrefix="e_leastSqrs4">In this exercise, you are asked to select one of four statements that correctly describes the slope or intercept of a least squares line in the context of the data.</page>




<page dir="en/regnEst" filePrefix="e_regnEst1">This exercise gives practice in evaluating a 95% confidence interval for a regression model's slope, based on its least squares estimate and standard error.</page>
<page dir="en/regnTest" filePrefix="e_regnTest1">This exercise gives practice with the calculations to evaluate the p-value for testing whether a linear model's slope is zero and interpreting the results.</page>
<page dir="en/curvature" filePrefix="e_curvature1">This exercise asks you to identify the difficulties with using the least squares line to predict Y at a given X from the data in a displayed scatterplot (an outlier, curvature, a high-leverage point or extrapolation).</page>
