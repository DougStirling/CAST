<page dir="en/valueDisplay" filePrefix="e_valueDisplay2">You just have to drag the final two crosses of a stacked dot plot into the correct places of the display.</page>
<page dir="en/boxPlot" filePrefix="e_boxPlot1">The exercises on this page involve drawing box plots from sorted lists of values. For the second exercise, 'outliers' must be separately identified.</page>

<page dir="en/boxPlot" filePrefix="e_boxPlot2">Can you match the shape of box plots to the corresponding dot plots?</page>

<page dir="en/displayInterp" filePrefix="e_displayInterp1">You interpret what distributions with symmetry, skewness, clusters or outliers tell you about the data.</page>

<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread1">You summarise the difference between two distributions in terms of their centres and spreads.</page>
<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread2">You practice estimating the mean and median from different skew and symmetric stacked dot plots?</page>
<page dir="en/centerSpread" filePrefix="e_centerSpread3">You 'guess' the standard deviation of data sets from a stacked dot plot. The second exercise is similar but displays the data as a histogram or box plot.</page>
