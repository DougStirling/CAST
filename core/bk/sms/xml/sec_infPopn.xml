The data are representative of some wider situation and we want to generalise from the data to describe features of this more general situation.</page>
<page dir="en/infPopn" filePrefix="infPopn_c2" summaryDir="en/infPopn" summaryFilePrefix="s_infPopn2" videoDir="en/infPopn" videoFilePrefix="v_infPopn_c2">If data collection was repeated, perhaps from different individuals, the values would be different. All such data sets should give similar but not identical information. Interpretation of a data set should take into account this randomness.</page>
<page dir="en/infPopn" filePrefix="infPopn_c3" summaryDir="en/infPopn" summaryFilePrefix="s_infPopn3" videoDir="en/infPopn" videoFilePrefix="v_infPopn_c3">Many data sets are not generated as random samples from real finite populations. However it is often useful to treat the data as a random sample from some abstract population containing the measurements that might have been recorded.</page>
<page dir="en/infPopn" filePrefix="infPopn4" summaryDir="en/infPopn" summaryFilePrefix="s_infPopn4" videoDir="en/infPopn" videoFilePrefix="v_infPopn4">The populations that are imagined to underly data often contain an infinite number of values and are called distributions.</page>
<page dir="en/infPopn" filePrefix="infPopn_c5" summaryDir="en/infPopn" summaryFilePrefix="s_infPopn5" videoDir="en/infPopn" videoFilePrefix="v_infPopn_c5">The mechanism of sampling from a population explains randomness. Although the population is unknown and we only have a single sample, the sample provides information about the population.</page>
