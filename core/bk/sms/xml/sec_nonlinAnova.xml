<page dir="en/nonlinAnova" filePrefix="nonlinAnova1">Linearity can be assessed by comparing the fits of a linear and quadratic model. The total sum of squares can be split into linear, quadratic and residual sums of squares.</page>
<page dir="en/nonlinAnova" filePrefix="nonlinAnova2">The quadratic sum of squares compares the fit of a linear and quadratic model and therefore holds information about whether there is curvature in the data.</page>
<page dir="en/nonlinAnova" filePrefix="nonlinAnova3">An F ratio comparing the quadratic and residual mean sums of squares can be used to test for linearity.</page>
