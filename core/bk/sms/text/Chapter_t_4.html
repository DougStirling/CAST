<h1>Chapter 4 &nbsp; Testing Hypotheses</h1>
<h2>4.1 &nbsp; Introduction to hypothesis tests</h2>
<h3>4.1.1 &nbsp; Inference</h3>
<p>Estimation asks which values for an unknown parameter are consistent with data that have been collected. Hypothesis testing usually asks whether the data are consistent with some parameter values.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 &nbsp; Test for a mean</h3>
<p>This page uses a simulation to test whether a sample is consistent with a particular population mean.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 &nbsp; Common patterns in tests</h3>
<p>All hypothesis tests involve a null hypothesis, a summary statistic for testing, an alternative hypothesis and a p-value.</p>
<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Tests about means</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Introduction</h3>
<p>For numerical populations, the null and alternative hypotheses usually specify values for the population mean. Tests are based on the sample mean.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; The t distribution</h3>
<p>When the population standard deviation is unknown, a different test statistic must be used. It has a standard distribution known as a t distribution.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; The t test for a mean</h3>
<p>The t distribution is used to obtain a p-value for tests about a population mean when the standard deviation is unknown.</p>
<h2>4.3 &nbsp; Properties of p-values</h2>
<h3>4.3.1 &nbsp; Null and alternative hypotheses</h3>
<p>Hypothesis tests ask whether the sample data are consistent with a statement about the parameters called the null hypothesis.</p>
<h3>4.3.2 &nbsp; Consistency with null hypothesis</h3>
<p>A p-value is a numerical measure of whether the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis.</p>
<h3>4.3.3 &nbsp; Interpretation of a p-value</h3>
<p>A p-value is the probability of getting such 'extreme' data when the null hypothesis holds.</p>
<h2>4.4 &nbsp; Models for two groups</h2>
<h3>4.4.1 &nbsp; Interest in underlying population</h3>
<p>As with single-group data, the populations underlying two-group data sets are usually of more interest than the specific sample data.</p>
<h3>4.4.2 &nbsp; Model for two groups</h3>
<p>Two-group data sets are often modelled as separate random samples from two normal populations.</p>
<h3>4.4.3 &nbsp; Testing a hypothesis</h3>
<p>A hypothesis test is developed for testing whether two group means are the same.</p>
<h3>4.4.4 &nbsp; One-tailed tests for differences</h3>
<p>If the alternative hypothesis is for one particular mean to be greater, then the p-value for the test is found from only one tail of the t distribution.</p>
<h2>4.5 &nbsp; Exercises</h2>
<h3>4.5.1 &nbsp; Generic interpretation of a p-values</h3>
<p>The two exercises on this page give p-values for hypothesis tests and ask you to pick the correct conclusion from the test. The first exercise has options in terms of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis; the second is harder with options referring to the alternative hypothesis also.</p>
<h3>4.5.2 &nbsp; Interpretation of p-values (in context)</h3>
<p>This exercise gives the p-value for a test and asks you to pick the correct conclusion, worded in terms of the problem context.</p>
<h3>4.5.3 &nbsp; Interpretation of p-values (harder)</h3>
<p>This exercise is similar to the previous one but the wordings of the conclusions are harder.</p>
