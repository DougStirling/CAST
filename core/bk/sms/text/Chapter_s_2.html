<p>Variation in data is not simply an annoyance &mdash; the variation itself can 
		hold important information.</p>
<p>Simply sorting a data set into order can highlight features that are not obvious in the raw data, such as the lack of values between 3.4 and 4.9 in the data below.</p>

<img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_dotPlot.gif" width="72" height="324" align="right">
<p class="heading notPrinted">Dot plots</p>
<p>Some ranges of values 
		are more common than others &mdash; they have higher <strong>density</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest graphical display of data that shows where there is high and low density is a <strong>dot
		plot</strong>. This shows each value as a cross (or dot) against a
		numerical axis.</p>
	<p>The gap between 3.4 and 4.9 is more obvious on the right than in a textual
list of values, whether ordered or not.</p>
	<br clear="all">





<h2 class="pageName">2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Jittering the crosses</p>
	<p>In all but the smallest data sets, the crosses on a basic dot plot overlap, making it difficult to identify regions of high density.</p>
	<p>Randomly moving crosses away from the axis reduces this problem by separating the crosses:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/valueDisplay/images/s_jitteredDotPlot.gif" width="398" height="72"><br clear="all">
	</p>
	<p>Note that the vertical jittering is random and therefore tells you nothing about the data.</p>
	




<h2 class="pageName">2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Stacked dot plots</p>
	<p><strong>Stacking</strong> the crosses into columns is usually better than
jittering them.</p>

	</p>
	<p>Stacking highlights regions of high density well (tall stacks).</p>
	


<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.2 &nbsp; Graphical display - boxplots</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.2.1 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h2>

<p class="heading">Unhelpful detail when comparing groups</p>
<p>Dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms contain a lot of detail about
the distribution of values in a data set. This level of detail is useful when
examining a single data set, but when several groups of values are being compared,
the detail distracts from the main differences between the groups.</p>
<p>For example, the jittered dot plots below do not concisely summarise the differences
between the five groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_jitteredGroups.gif" width="413" height="224"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h2>

<p class="heading">Five-number summary</p>
<p>Five values are enough to capture a lot of information about the distribution of values in a data set.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The two <strong>extremes</strong>  (i.e. the minimum and maximum values).</li>
	<li>The <strong>lower quartile</strong>, <strong>median</strong> and <strong>upper quartile</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These values split the data set into four groups with approximately equal numbers of values.</p>
<p class="heading">Box plot</p>
<p>A box plot displays the five-number summary graphically.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_boxPlotDefn.gif" width="445" height="225"></p>
<p class="heading">Details</p>
<p>The median, <em>m</em>, is the middle value if there is an odd number of values in the data set. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two.</p>
<p>Different authors give slightly different definitions for the upper and lower
quartiles. One definition of the lower quartile is the median of the lowest half
of the data &mdash; i.e. of the values lower than <em>m</em>. (The upper quartile
would then be defined as the median of the top half of the values.)</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Provided you are consistent, different definitions of the quartiles  should lead you to the same conclusions.</p>
</div></div>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.3 &nbsp; Displaying outliers</h2>

<p class="heading">Outliers and skew distributions</p>
<p>Basic box plots cannot show whether the minimum and maximum in a distribution are outliers or simply the end of skew distributions.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_outlierSkew.gif" width="453" height="236"></p>
<p class="heading">Improved box plot</p>
<p>Box plots are often drawn with 'outliers' shown as separate crosses. The usual definition of  'outliers' in box plots are values more than 1.5 interquartile ranges outside the two quartiles.</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/outlierDefn.gif" id="gif_image_2_3_1" width="504" height="124"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/outlierDefn.svg" id="svg_image_2_3_1" width="504" height="124" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_2_3_1");</script> </p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.4 &nbsp; Comparison of groups</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Box plots to compare groups</p>
	<p>To display the distribution of values in a single set of data, a dot plot
or histogram is more useful than a box plot. However for comparison of <strong>two
or more groups</strong> of values box plots are particularly effective &mdash; they
highlight differences between the centres, spreads of values and skewness of
the groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/boxPlot/images/s_boxGroups.gif" width="413" height="224"></p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.2.5 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h2>

<p class="heading notPrinted">Stability of the shape of box plots</p>
<p>When used for small data sets, features in dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms 
	are relatively unstable. Although more stable, the shapes of box plots also vary if different data are collected from the same process. </p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>Care must 
  be taken not to over-interpret the shape of box plots for small data sets.</p></div></div>
<p>As with other displays, the larger the data set, the more stable the box 
	plots become.</p>




<h1 class="sectionName breakBefore">2.3 &nbsp; Describing centre and spread</h1>
<h2 class="pageName">2.3.1 &nbsp; Median, range and IQR</h2>

<p class="heading">Simple summaries of centre and spread</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Centre</dt>
		<dd>The <strong>median</strong> is the simplest measure of centre. Half the
 data values are more than it, and half less.</dd>
		<dt>Spread</dt>
		<dd>The <strong>range</strong> (maximum - minimum) and <strong>interquartile 
			range</strong> (upper quartile - lower quartile) are two different summary 
			statistics that describe the spread of values in a data set.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class=heading>Information from median and interquartile range</p>
	<p>Given the median and interquartile range, it is possible to sketch a bell-shaped 
		histogram that matches these values. Such a 'guess' is often close to the 
		actual distribution of values.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/iqrAndHisto.gif" id="gif_image_3_1_1" width="424" height="223"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/iqrAndHisto.svg" id="svg_image_3_1_1" width="424" height="223" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_3_1_1");</script></p>





<h2 class="pageName">2.3.2 &nbsp; Summaries of centre</h2>

<p class=heading>Median</p>
	<p>Half of the data values are below the median and half are above it:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/medianProperties.gif" id="gif_image_3_2_1" width="500" height="140"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/medianProperties.svg" id="svg_image_3_2_1" width="500" height="140" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_3_2_1");</script></p>
	<p class=heading>Mean</p>
	<p>The mean  is: </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/meanEqn.gif" id="gif_image_3_2_2" width="70" height="35"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/meanEqn.svg" id="svg_image_3_2_2" width="70" height="35" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_3_2_2");</script> </p>
	<p>If each value in a dot plot was a solid object resting on a beam with negligible mass, the mean is the value at which the beam will balance.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_balance.gif" width="451" height="139"></p>
	<p>Because of the leverage exerted by points far from the centre, the mean is further into the tail of a skew distribution than you might expect.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.3 &nbsp; Properties of median and mean</h2>

<p>Although both describe aspects of the 'centre' of a distribution, the median and mean are 
		not the same and can occasionally have very different values.</p>
	<p class=heading>Social vs economic indicator</p>
	<p>For some data sets, <strong>the median can be considered to be a social indicator,
		whereas the mean can be interpreted as an economic indicator</strong>. In a company,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the median salary indicates what the 'average employee' earns
			(half of the employees earn more and half earn less)</li>
		<li>the mean salary reflects the total amount paid as salaries in the company
			(it is <em>total</em>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<em>n</em>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Outliers</p>
	<p>An outlier has little effect on the  median,
		but affects the mean more strongly. The median is
		said to be more <strong>robust</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Skew distributions</p>
	<p>When a distribution  is fairly symmetrical, the mean and median
		are similar, but if the distribution is skew, then the mean is usually further
into the tail of the distribution than the median.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_meanMedian.gif" width="452" height="143"> </p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.4 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h2>

<p class="heading">Simple measures of spread</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Range</dt>
		<dd>Difference between maximum and minimum values</dd>
		<dt>Inter-quartile range</dt>
		<dd>The middle half of the values are within an interval of this length</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>These are (relatively) easy to understand and explain to others, but neither are commonly used.</p>
	<p class="heading">Standard deviation</p>
	<p>The standard deviation is a 'typical' distance of values from the sample mean.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations.gif" id="gif_image_3_4_1" width="434" height="166"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations.svg" id="svg_image_3_4_1" width="434" height="166" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_3_4_1");</script> </p>
	<p>The  standard deviation  is denoted by the letter <span class="black em">s</span>  and
is defined by:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/sdDefn.gif" id="gif_image_3_4_2" width="115" height="52"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/sdDefn.svg" id="svg_image_3_4_2" width="115" height="52" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_3_4_2");</script></p>
	<p>The numerator, <span class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/ssqDevns.gif" id="gif_image_3_4_3" width="70" height="26"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/ssqDevns.svg" id="svg_image_3_4_3" width="70" height="26" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_3_4_3");</script></span>, depends on the distances of the values to the mean, so it will be small if the values are all close to the mean and big if they are far from the mean.</p>
	<p class="heading">Variance</p>
	<p>The square of the standard deviation, <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, is called the
sample <strong>variance</strong>. Variances are sometimes reported and used but
standard deviations are easier to interpret since they have  the same units as
the original data (e.g. kilograms or dollars).</p>

 


<h2 class="pageName">2.3.5 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h2>

<p class="heading">'Quarter-range' rule of thumb</p>
	<p>For many data sets, the standard deviation is just under 
		a quarter of the range.</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><img class="gif" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations2.gif" id="gif_image_3_5_1" width="454" height="158"><iframe class="svg" src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/deviations2.svg" id="svg_image_3_5_1" width="454" height="158" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">showCorrectImage("image_3_5_1");</script></td>
	</tr>
</table></div>

	<p>This is a simple rule, but is only very approximate. The standard deviation 
		can be more than a quarter the range in distributions with short tails or 
		much less if there are long tails or outliers.</p>
	<p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb</p>
	<p>The <strong>70-95-100 rule</strong> is more accurate. In many distributions, </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Approximately 70% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
		<li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
		<li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule holds approximately for most reasonably symmetric data 
		sets, but for skew data or distributions with long tails, outliers or clusters, it is often less accurate.</p>




<h2 class="pageName">2.3.6 &nbsp; Warnings about mean &amp; st devn</h2>

	<p class=eqn><img src="../../../en/centerSpread/images/s_anscombe.gif" width="399" height="435"> </p>
	<p>Clusters, outliers and skewness are important features of a data set and should influence the analysis

<h2 class="pageName">2.3.7 &nbsp; Effect of outliers</h2>

<p class="heading">Outliers and the standard deviation</p>
	<p>The mean and standard deviation  are  inadequate descriptions 
		of distributions that have clusters, outliers or skewness.</p>
	<p>An outlier has a  strong influence on the mean of the 
		data and an even bigger effect on the standard deviation. In the data below, one measurement was missing and coded as '999'. If this value (999) is included, the mean is a feasible value, but the standard deviation should be recognised as being unreasonable.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../../../en/moreVariation/images/s_outlier.gif" width="500" height="277"></p>
	<p>A graphical display such as a dot plot is the best way to detect an outlier and you should <strong>always look at the data</strong> before summarising with a mean and standard deviation.</p>
	<p>An outlier should be carefully examined. Was the value incorrectly recorded? Was there something unusual about the individual from which the measurement was obtained? If we are convinced that there was something wrong about the value, it should be removed from the data set before further analysis.</p>
