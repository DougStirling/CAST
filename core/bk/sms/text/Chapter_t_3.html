<h1>Chapter 3 &nbsp; Making Good Generalisations</h1>
<h2>3.1 &nbsp; Finite populations</h2>
<h3>3.1.1 &nbsp; Census or sample?</h3>
<p>A sample provides information about a population when it is too difficult or expensive to make measurements from the whole population.</p>
<h3>3.1.2 &nbsp; Variability in a sample</h3>
<p>A sample is usually collected to provide information about an underlying population. However sample-to-sample variability must be taken into account when doing this.</p>
<h3>3.1.3 &nbsp; Sampling error</h3>
<p>When a sample is used to estimate a population characteristic, an error is usually involved. Sampling error is caused by random selection of the sample from the population.</p>
<h3>3.1.4 &nbsp; Selecting a random sample</h3>
<p>Random digits can be selected by rolling a 10-sided die, looking up a table of random digits or using a computer. These random digits can be combined to select a random member of a population. Repeating the process gives a random sample.</p>
<h2>3.2 &nbsp; Infinite populations</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 &nbsp; Data as representatives</h3>
<p>We often have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data are collected. The data are representative of some wider situation and we want to generalise from the data to describe features of this more general situation.</p>
<h3>3.2.2 &nbsp; Randomness of data</h3>
<p>If data collection was repeated, perhaps from different individuals, the values would be different. All such data sets should give similar but not identical information. Interpretation of a data set should take into account this randomness.</p>
<h3>3.2.3 &nbsp; Model to explain randomness</h3>
<p>Many data sets are not generated as random samples from real finite populations. However it is often useful to treat the data as a random sample from some abstract population containing the measurements that might have been recorded.</p>
<h3>3.2.4 &nbsp; Infinite populations (distributions)</h3>
<p>The populations that are imagined to underly data often contain an infinite number of values and are called distributions.</p>
<h3>3.2.5 &nbsp; Information from a sample</h3>
<p>The mechanism of sampling from a population explains randomness. Although the population is unknown and we only have a single sample, the sample provides information about the population.</p>
<h2>3.3 &nbsp; Normal distributions</h2>
<h3>3.3.1 &nbsp; Importance of normal distributions</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are sometimes useful as models for data, but the main reason for their importance is that sample means and many other summary statistics have approximately normal distributions.</p>
<h3>3.3.2 &nbsp; Shape of normal distributions</h3>
<p>All normal distributions look the same on a scale of standard deviations from the mean.</p>
<h3>3.3.3 &nbsp; Sketching a normal distribution</h3>
<p>Normal distributions are centred on their mean, µ, and have hardly any area beyond 3σ  on each side. A small area (about 5%) is over 2 standard deviations away from the mean.</p>
<h3>3.3.4 &nbsp; Some normal probabilities</h3>
<p>The probabilities of being within (σ, 2σ, and 3σ) of the mean are (0.68, 0.95 and 0.997) for all normal distributions. This is a close match to the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb for numerical data sets.</p>
<h2>3.4 &nbsp; Distribution of sample mean</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 &nbsp; Parameters and statistics</h3>
<p>A summary value describing a population is called a parameter and the corresponding value in a sample is called a statistic. Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.</p>
<h3>3.4.2 &nbsp; Variability of sample mean</h3>
<p>A sample mean has a distribution that is centred round the population mean but has smaller spread than the population.</p>
<h3>3.4.3 &nbsp; Standard devn of sample mean</h3>
<p>The spread of the sample mean decreases as sample size increases. A formula is given for the standard deviation of the sample mean in terms of the sample size and population standard deviation.</p>
<h3>3.4.4 &nbsp; Means from normal populations</h3>
<p>Sample means from normal populations also have normal distributions.</p>
<h3>3.4.5 &nbsp; Large-sample normality of means</h3>
<p>The shape of the sample mean's distribution is usually close to normal, even if the population distribution is skew or multimodal. The bigger the sample size, the closer the distribution to normal.</p>
<h2>3.5 &nbsp; Introduction to estimation</h2>
<h3>3.5.1 &nbsp; Interest in populations</h3>
<p>When data are collected, we are usually more interested in the unknown population distribution from which we assume that the data were generated.</p>
<h3>3.5.2 &nbsp; Interest in parameters</h3>
<p>A few numerical summaries of a population distribution (parameters) often capture its most interesting characteristics. The corresponding sample statistics provide estimates.</p>
<h3>3.5.3 &nbsp; Standard error</h3>
<p>In most practical applications, the population standard deviation is unknown. The standard error of the sample mean can be approximated by replacing the population mean by the sample mean in its formula.</p>
<h3>3.5.4 &nbsp; Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the interpretation (and value) of the standard error (SE) and standard deviation (SD).</p>
<h2>3.6 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean</h2>
<h3>3.6.1 &nbsp; Confidence interval from standard error</h3>
<p>The estimation error for any estimator, has approximately 0.95 probability of being between -2SE and +2SE. An approximate 95% confidence interval for the parameter is therefore the estimate ± 2SE.</p>
<h3>3.6.2 &nbsp; Confidence level</h3>
<p>In practice, the population standard deviation is usually unknown. If the population SD is simply replaced by its sample equivalent, the interval estimate has a lower confidence level than 95%.</p>
<h3>3.6.3 &nbsp; Confidence interval for mean</h3>
<p>To get a 95% confidence level, a t-value from tables must replace the constant 1.96.</p>
<h3>3.6.4 &nbsp; Properties of 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>A simulation demonstrates that the resulting 95% confidence intervals have probability 0.95 of including the population mean.</p>
<h3>3.6.5 &nbsp; Examples</h3>
<p>Some examples of 95% confidence intervals for population means are given and interpreted.</p>
<h2>3.7 &nbsp; Exercises</h2>
<h3>3.7.1 &nbsp; Shape of normal distribution </h3>
<p>One exercise asks you to guess the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Another requests a sketch of a normal distribution given its mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>3.7.2 &nbsp; Guessing normal probabilities</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb gives the approximate probability of a value within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. Te exercise uses this rule of thumb to find some normal probabilities without formal calculations.</p>
<h3>3.7.3 &nbsp; Distinction between populations and samples</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page asks whether three statements describe populations or samples.</p>
<h3>3.7.4 &nbsp; Distinction between parameters and estimates</h3>
<p>This exercise asks whether three statements describe parameters or estimates.</p>
<h3>3.7.5 &nbsp; Standard error of mean</h3>
<p>The exercise on this page shows a data set with the sample mean and st devn. The standard error of the mean must be calculated.</p>
<h3>3.7.6 &nbsp; Standard error vs standard deviation</h3>
<p>This exercise states the value of either the standard deviation or the standard error or the mean. The question asks for an interval containing about 95% of the values or an interval with 95% confidence of including the popn mean.</p>
<h3>3.7.7 &nbsp; Factors affecting the standard deviation and standard error</h3>
<p>This exercise asks 3 questions about the effect of sample size and spread of sample values on the sd and se, and about the interpretation of the se and sd.</p>
<h3>3.7.8 &nbsp; 95% confidence interval, unknown sigma</h3>
<p>This exercise is similar to the previous one but requires use of a t distribution since the population standard deviation is unknown.</p>
<h3>3.7.9 &nbsp; Factors affecting width of CI</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, sample standard deviation and confidence level affect the width of a CI for the mean.</p>
<h3>3.7.10 &nbsp; Interpreting a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</p>
