<h1>Chapter 2 &nbsp; Describing Data Well</h1>
<h2>2.1 &nbsp; Graphical display - dotplots</h2>
<h3>2.1.1 &nbsp; Analysing variation</h3>
<p>Meaningful information can be obtained from variation in the values of a variable.</p>
<h3>2.1.2 &nbsp; Basic dot plot</h3>
<p>A dot plot displays each value as a cross along a numerical axis.</p>
<h3>2.1.3 &nbsp; Jittered dot plot</h3>
<p>Jittering is a modification to the basic dot plot that avoids some problems associated with overlapping crosses</p>
<h3>2.1.4 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h3>
<p>Stacking of the crosses is an alternative to jittering that highlights ranges of high or low density.</p>
<h2>2.2 &nbsp; Graphical display - boxplots</h2>
<h3>2.2.1 &nbsp; The need to summarise</h3>
<p>Dot plots and histograms contain detailed information that is distracting when two or more data sets are being compared.</p>
<h3>2.2.2 &nbsp; Median, quartiles and box plot</h3>
<p>The median and quartiles split a batch of values into four equal-sized sets of values. A box plot is a graphical display of the median, quartiles and extremes.</p>
<h3>2.2.3 &nbsp; Displaying outliers</h3>
<p>The basic box plot is often modified to display outliers as separate crosses.</p>
<h3>2.2.4 &nbsp; Comparison of groups</h3>
<p>Box plots are particularly effective for displaying differences between several groups of values.</p>
<h3>2.2.5 &nbsp; Dangers of over-interpretation</h3>
<p>Box plots are relatively stable, and contain less 'noise' than other displays. They can concisely describe differences between even small groups.</p>
<h2>2.3 &nbsp; Describing centre and spread</h2>
<h3>2.3.1 &nbsp; Median, range and IQR</h3>
<p>The median is a summary of the centre of a distribution. The range and inter-quartile range both describe spread.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 &nbsp; Summaries of centre</h3>
<p>The median and mean are alternative measures of the centre of a distribution.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 &nbsp; Properties of median and mean</h3>
<p>When a data set is not symmetric, the mean and median may differ substantially.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 &nbsp; Standard deviation</h3>
<p>The standard deviation is the most commonly used numerical summary of the spread of values in a data set.</p>
<h3>2.3.5 &nbsp; Rules of thumb for st devn</h3>
<p>The 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb is useful for understanding the numerical value of the standard deviation.</p>
<h3>2.3.6 &nbsp; Warnings about mean &amp; st devn</h3>
<p>The mean and standard deviation cannot give any indication of the existance of outliers, skewness or clusters. A dot plot or histogram should be examined before reporting these numerical summaries.</p>
<h3>2.3.7 &nbsp; Effect of outliers</h3>
<p>If a data set contains an outlier, the mean and especially the standard deviation can be badly affected. The values may be obviously wrong when the 70-95-100 rule is applied in the context of the data but examining a dot plot or box plot is best.</p>
<h2>2.4 &nbsp; Exercises</h2>
<h3>2.4.1 &nbsp; Stacked dot plots</h3>
<p>You just have to drag the final two crosses of a stacked dot plot into the correct places of the display.</p>
<h3>2.4.2 &nbsp; Box plots</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page involve drawing box plots from sorted lists of values. For the second exercise, 'outliers' must be separately identified.</p>
<h3>2.4.3 &nbsp; Shape of a box plot</h3>
<p>Can you match the shape of box plots to the corresponding dot plots?</p>
<h3>2.4.4 &nbsp; Information from distributions</h3>
<p>You interpret what distributions with symmetry, skewness, clusters or outliers tell you about the data.</p>
<h3>2.4.5 &nbsp; Ideas of centre and spread</h3>
<p>You summarise the difference between two distributions in terms of their centres and spreads.</p>
<h3>2.4.6 &nbsp; Mean and median</h3>
<p>You practice estimating the mean and median from different skew and symmetric stacked dot plots?</p>
<h3>2.4.7 &nbsp; Standard deviation from graph</h3>
<p>You 'guess' the standard deviation of data sets from a stacked dot plot. The second exercise is similar but displays the data as a histogram or box plot.</p>
