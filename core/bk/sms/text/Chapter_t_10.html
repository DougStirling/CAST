<h1>Chapter 10 &nbsp; Coming Down from the Mountains</h1>
<h2>10.1 &nbsp; Some review exercises</h2>
<h3>10.1.1 &nbsp; Shape of a box plot</h3>
<p>The exercises on this page involve matching the shape of box plots to the corresponding dot plots.</p>
<h3>10.1.2 &nbsp; Information from distributions</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will interpret what distributions with symmetry, skewness, clusters or outliers tell you about the data.</p>
<h3>10.1.3 &nbsp; Ideas of centre and spread</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you should summarise the difference between two distributions in terms of their different centres and spreads.</p>
<h3>10.1.4 &nbsp; Standard deviation from graph</h3>
<p>The first exercise asks for a rough 'guess' at the standard deviation of data sets from a stacked dot plot. The second exercise is similar but displays the data as a histogram or box plot.</p>
<h3>10.1.5 &nbsp; Factors affecting the standard deviation and standard error</h3>
<p>This exercise asks 3 questions about the effect of sample size and spread of sample values on the sd and se, and about the interpretation of the se and sd.</p>
<h3>10.1.6 &nbsp; Interpreting a 95% confidence interval</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you must choose which of four statements correctly interprets the meaning of a 95% confidence interval.</p>
<h3>10.1.7 &nbsp; Interpretation of p-values (harder)</h3>
<p>This exercise is similar to the previous one but the wordings of the conclusions are harder.</p>
<h2>10.2 &nbsp; A few more exercises!</h2>
<h3>10.2.1 &nbsp; Interpreting the slope and intercept</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you are asked to select one of four statements that correctly describes the slope or intercept of a least squares line in the context of the data.</p>
<h3>10.2.2 &nbsp; Standard error of slope</h3>
<p>This exercise gives practice in evaluating a 95% confidence interval for a regression model's slope, based on its least squares estimate and standard error.</p>
<h3>10.2.3 &nbsp; Regression problems</h3>
<p>This exercise asks you to identify the difficulties with using the least squares line to predict Y at a given X from the data in a displayed scatterplot (an outlier, curvature, a high-leverage point or extrapolation).</p>
<h3>10.2.4 &nbsp; Clusters and outliers (advanced)</h3>
<p>The two exercises on this page ask the effect of combining different groups of values or adding an outlier on the mean and standard deviation.</p>
<h3>10.2.5 &nbsp; Shape of distribution of mean and sum</h3>
<p>This exercise examines understanding of the limiting normal distribution of the sample mean and sum as sample size increases, whatever the shape of the population distribution.</p>
<h3>10.2.6 &nbsp; Distribution of mean and sum (cont)</h3>
<p>In this exercise, pop-up menus are used to specify the centre, spread and skewness of the distribution of a sample mean, sample sum or a single value, given the population distribution.</p>
<h3>10.2.7 &nbsp; Factors affecting width of confidence interval</h3>
<p>This exercise asks how the sample size, confidence level and population probability affect the width of a CI for the probability.</p>
