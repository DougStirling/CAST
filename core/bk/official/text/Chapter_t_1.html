<h1>Chapter 1 &nbsp; Tables, graphs and maps</h1>
<h2>1.1 &nbsp; Simple tables</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 &nbsp; Frequency tables</h3>
<p>A frequency table counts the number of items in a population that are in different groups.</p>
<h3>1.1.3 &nbsp; Tables for other partitions</h3>
<p>Other quantities such as money or production may be partitioned into several categories. The total of the values in the categories is meaningful in such tables.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 &nbsp; Proportions and percentages</h3>
<p>For frequency tables and other partitions, a column of percentages is often added.</p>
<h3>1.1.5 &nbsp; Other simple tables</h3>
<p>An example shows a simple table whose values are not a partition of a meaningful total.</p>
<h3>1.1.6 &nbsp; Variations</h3>
<p>In simple tables, the categories may be reordered, related categories can be combined and it may be informative to restrict attention to a subset of categories.</p>
<h3>1.1.7 &nbsp; Tables within tables</h3>
<p>Larger published tables often consist of a set of smaller simple tables in different columns. Two examples are presented.</p>
<h2>1.2 &nbsp; Presenting data in tables</h2>
<h3>1.2.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 &nbsp; Gridlines and white space</h3>
<p>Never use gridlines to box all values in a table. In large multi-column tables, reading across rows is easier with occasional hairlines of light shading, but otherwise consider using white space to separate associated groups of rows or columns.</p>
<h3>1.2.3 &nbsp; Layout and annotation</h3>
<p>Use white space to group related rows and columns. Rearranging rows or columns may bring values that should be compared closer. Summarise and interpret in the body of a report but do not simply repeat values.</p>
<h3>1.2.4 &nbsp; Significant digits and data noise</h3>
<p>The meaningful information is 'signal'. Information that does not help understanding of the data is 'noise'. Noise includes data noise and unnecessary embellishments to the table. Decreasing the significant digits displayed often decreases data noise.</p>
<h3>1.2.5 &nbsp; Meaningful variables</h3>
<p>Showing proportions in a multi-column table instead of frequencies makes it easier to compare groups. Ratios of variables can be easier to interpret than their raw values.</p>
<h3>1.2.6 &nbsp; Swapping rows and columns</h3>
<p>It is easier to compare values down rows than across columns. Interchanging the rows and columns of a table can make it easier to make comparisons.</p>
<h3>1.2.7 &nbsp; Reordering rows</h3>
<p>Rearranging the rows (or columns) may make the information in large tables stand out better.</p>
<h3>1.2.8 &nbsp; Example</h3>
<p>An example shows a published table whose presentation can be improved in many ways.</p>
<h2>1.3 &nbsp; Bar charts</h2>
<h3>1.3.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 &nbsp; Bar charts</h3>
<p>The simplest graphical display of a table of values is a bar chart. The bars can be drawn either vertically or horizontally. If the values are partitions of a total, a second axis with percentages can be added.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 &nbsp; Ordering of categories</h3>
<p>If there is no natural ordering of the categories in a bar chart, it is often informative to arrange them in decreasing order of the values. If the values are partitions of a total, cumulative percentages can be added.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 &nbsp; Importance of zero and -ve values</h3>
<p>If possible, all bars should start at zero, so bar length is proportional to the values. If the axis does not include zero, this should be clearly indicated with zig-zags on the bars or axis. Negative values can be represented with bars hanging below the axis.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 &nbsp; Chartjunk</h3>
<p>Three-dimensional representations of bar charts should be avoided.</p>
<h3>1.3.6 &nbsp; Misleading bar charts</h3>
<p>It is misleading to replace simple bars with 2- or 3-dimensional objects whose height represents the values since the visual impression depends on the area or volume of the objects.</p>
<h3>1.3.7 &nbsp; Histograms</h3>
<p>For frequency tables describing the distribution of continuous measurements, the bars of a bar chart have their heights equal to the frequencies if all classes have the same width. However this is misleading if the class widths vary and the bar heights must be defined differently.</p>
<h2>1.4 &nbsp; Pie charts</h2>
<h3>1.4.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.4.2 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts and pie charts</h3>
<p>The bars in a bar chart are sometimes stacked on top of each other. An alternative display is to represent the values by segments of a circle. These displays must only be used when the values are partitions of some total.</p>
<h3>1.4.3 &nbsp; Comparison of bar and pie charts</h3>
<p>Individual categories can be compared more easily in a bar chart. The combined contribution of the total of several categories is displayed better in a pie chart.</p>
<h3>1.4.4 &nbsp; Chartjunk for pie charts</h3>
<p>Three-dimensional pie charts should be avoided.</p>
<h3>1.4.5 &nbsp; Misleading stacked bar charts</h3>
<p>Avoid splitting a picture into segments to form a stacked bar chart. The resulting picture often misrepresents the values for the different categories.</p>
<h3>1.4.6 &nbsp; Colour</h3>
<p>Colour is helpful to distinguish the categories in a pie chart. If it must be printed with shades of grey, care must be taken with the labelling of the categories.</p>
<h2>1.5 &nbsp; Comparing groups</h2>
<h3>1.5.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.5.2 &nbsp; Two-way tables</h3>
<p>Data for comparing groups are often displayed in a two-way table with either the rows or columns corresponding to the different groups.</p>
<h3>1.5.3 &nbsp; Proportions within groups</h3>
<p>If the values in each group are partitions of a group total such as a frequency table, a table or bar chart of percentages within the groups highlights the differences.</p>
<h3>1.5.4 &nbsp; Clustered bar charts</h3>
<p>The bars can be clustered together by group or by category.</p>
<h3>1.5.5 &nbsp; Stacked bar charts</h3>
<p>If there are many groups, stacking the bars often makes it easier to compare the groups.</p>
<h3>1.5.6 &nbsp; Two categories</h3>
<p>If there are only two categories in each group, there is no need to present both proportions. A simple bar chart of one proportion is sufficient and allows the scale to be expanded if the proportion is small for all groups.</p>
<h3>1.5.7 &nbsp; Chartjunk</h3>
<p>Three-dimensional versions of clustered and stacked bar charts make it harder to understand the data and can be misleading.</p>
<h2>1.6 &nbsp; Relationships between measurements</h2>
<h3>1.6.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.6.2 &nbsp; Scatterplots</h3>
<p>A scatterplot displays the values of two measurements from each region or other 'individual'.</p>
<h3>1.6.3 &nbsp; Information from scatterplots</h3>
<p>Scatterplots show whether particular values of one measurement are associated with particular values of the second measurement. The strength of the relationship is important. Crosses that do not conform to the same relationship as the rest of the data are also important.</p>
<h3>1.6.4 &nbsp; Distinguishing groups</h3>
<p>The crosses on a scatterplot can be coloured to distinguish different groups, or differing symbols can be used.</p>
<h3>1.6.5 &nbsp; Showing size</h3>
<p>Scatterplots are often used when the crosses correspond to different geographical regions. If these differ in size, the crosses can be replaced by circles whose area is proportional to the size -- e.g. area, population or GDP.</p>
<h3>1.6.6 &nbsp; Nonlinear scales</h3>
<p>Economic measurements from countries often contain many small values, but a few very large values (usually corresponding to rich countries). In order to distinguish the small values (often poor countries), a nonlinear scale can be used on a scatterplot.</p>
<h2>1.7 &nbsp; Maps</h2>
<h3>1.7.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.7.2 &nbsp; Colouring regions</h3>
<p>The geographic distribution of a measurement can be displayed using different colours on a map.</p>
<h3>1.7.3 &nbsp; Choice of colours</h3>
<p>The choice of colours to represent numerical measurements on a map is important. A continuous graduation involving three contrasting colours or a grouping into classes is usually best.</p>
<h3>1.7.4 &nbsp; Adding information with circles</h3>
<p>Shading regions on a map can only represent a single measurement. Drawing a circle on each region can represent both a 'size' measurement with the circle area and another measurement with its colour.</p>
<h3>1.7.5 &nbsp; Maps with pie and bar charts</h3>
<p>Maps can have other simple bar and pie charts superimposed on each region. Only simple information about each region should be displayed in this way.</p>
<h3>1.7.6 &nbsp; Distorted population maps</h3>
<p>In most conventional maps, the areas of the regions are proportional to their land areas. The shapes of the regions can be distorted to make their areas proportional to their populations.</p>
<h3>1.7.7 &nbsp; Other distorted maps</h3>
<p>It is sometimes informative to distort a map to make the areas of regions proportional to other measurements. These measurements must be partitions of a meaningful total so that the combined measurement for two regions would be their total.</p>
<h2>1.8 &nbsp; Changes over time</h2>
<h3>1.8.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.8.2 &nbsp; Time series charts</h3>
<p>Changes to a single numerical measurement over time can be displayed in a scatterplot of the measurement against time with successive values joined by lines.</p>
<h3>1.8.3 &nbsp; Time series for quantities</h3>
<p>If the measurement is a quantity, an alternative display is a bar chart with a bar for each successive value.</p>
<h3>1.8.4 &nbsp; Time series with categories</h3>
<p>If the values at each time point form a partition of some total, such as a frequency table, a series of stacked bar charts of the values or proportions provides an effective display.</p>
<h3>1.8.5 &nbsp; Chartjunk</h3>
<p>Simple time series are sometimes drawn in 3 dimensions as a ribbon chart. This may look more artistic, but makes the information in the data harder to see.</p>
<h3>1.8.6 &nbsp; Dynamic pie and bar charts</h3>
<p>When presented on a computer, simple diagrams such as pie and bar charts can be animated to show how they change over time. However when the individual diagrams are simple, it is often possible to display all data in a static diagram more effectively. </p>
<h3>1.8.7 &nbsp; Dynamic histograms</h3>
<p>Frequency tables of numerical measurements such as ages are usually displayed in histograms. They too can be animated to show changes over time.</p>
<h3>1.8.8 &nbsp; Dynamic scatterplots</h3>
<p>A particularly useful type of display to animate is a scatterplot, either of crosses or circles of varying sizes. When the crosses represent countries or regions, it is often possible to pick out ones that behave differently from the rest. </p>
<h3>1.8.9 &nbsp; Dynamic maps</h3>
<p>Maps can also be animated to show changes over time. The measurement of interest can be displayed with either the shading of countries on the map or of circles that are superimposed on it.</p>
<h2>1.9 &nbsp; Data presentation principles</h2>
<h3>1.9.1 &nbsp; Overview</h3>
<p>This page is an overview of the section.</p>
<h3>1.9.2 &nbsp; Types of publication</h3>
<p>Information may be published in executive reports, for archival purposes or in documents for the general public. Publication is increasingly done electronically rather than on paper. Resolution, availability of colour, production cost and ease of formatting are issues that should be considered.</p>
<h3>1.9.3 &nbsp; From data to information</h3>
<p>Reports generally only summarise the most important features of the available data. Identifying the important features is subjective and is similar to extracting the signal from a noisy electronic communication.</p>
<h3>1.9.4 &nbsp; Tables, graphs and text</h3>
<p>Reports should contain a balance of tables, graphs and text. Annotations on graphs can highlight important features.</p>
<h3>1.9.5 &nbsp; Combining simple graphs</h3>
<p>Several simple graphs can sometimes be linked together in a single display. They should usually be either drawn on a common time axis or a map.</p>
<h3>1.9.6 &nbsp; Advanced graphs</h3>
<p>Most reports only contain simple graphs such as the general-purpose ones described in this chapter. More advanced graphs are needed to effectively display some specific types of data but they are generally too complex for reports intended for the general public.</p>
<h3>1.9.7 &nbsp; Innovative graphics</h3>
<p>Some excellent graphics have been devised to display particular data sets. There is still scope for innovation.</p>
