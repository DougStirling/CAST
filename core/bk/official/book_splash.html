  <p>This module currently only contains a single chapter describing the principles that should be followed when presenting data using tables, graphs and maps in reports and other documents. Many examples of good data presentation are provided, and the methods are explained with dynamic and interactive diagrams.</p>
  <p>It is hoped to eventually expand this into a full e-book about Official Statistics with other chapters that are relevant to staff who collect or use data from National Statistics Offices, 
  other government departments and international agencies.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>The Official Statistics e-book will eventually cover many 
 		topics that are not taught in conventional statistics courses. 	</div></div>
