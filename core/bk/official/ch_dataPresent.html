<p class="heading">Need for data</p>
  
  
<p>Most organisations collect data. </p>
<ul>
<li>Routine data about the operation of the organisation.</li>
<li>Data relating to specific projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is particularly true for National Statistical Offices &mdash; they exist purely 
to collect, analyse and report information about the state of their countries 
-- but the functions of many other national and international organisations rely 
on similar data. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Aid agencies need reliable information about nutrition and health, so that 
aid can be targetted at regions in greatest need. Data can also provide evidence 
to sponsors about the effectiveness of their donations.</li>
<li>Hospitals monitor demand for different services in order to allocate resources 
and to justify the need for extra government funding in specific areas.</li>
<li>Agricultural departments monitor climate and crop yields in order to forecast 
and prepare for climatic extremes, and to give advice about more suitable crops 
in different regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, the raw data only become useful when they provide meaningful 
information about issues of importance.</p>
<p class="heading">Data presentation</p>
<p>It is important that the information extracted from data is effectively conveyed 
to others. Data (and information from data) are usually presented in reports and 
other publications. This chapter describes the main tools and principles for presenting 
data in tables, graphs, maps, and in paragraphs of descriptive text.</p>
<p class="heading">Collecting data</p>
<p>Data presentation is the last step in a longer process. Deciding the types 
of value to collect and analyse for any particular purpose is non-trivial but 
important<strong></strong>. The mechanism used to collect the data also has a 
strong influence on the accuracy and reliability of the resulting conclusions.</p>
<p>The types of measurement that are appropriate for any purpose and how data 
are collected are <strong>critically important</strong>. However these topics 
will not be discussed until later sections.</p>
