<page dir='en/simpleBar' filePrefix='simpleBar0'>This page is an overview of the section.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleBar' filePrefix='simpleBar1'>The simplest graphical display of a table of values is a bar chart. The bars can be drawn either vertically or horizontally. If the values are partitions of a total, a second axis with percentages can be added.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleBar' filePrefix='simpleBar2'>If there is no natural ordering of the categories in a bar chart, it is often informative to arrange them in decreasing order of the values. If the values are partitions of a total, cumulative percentages can be added.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleBar' filePrefix='simpleBar3'>If possible, all bars should start at zero, so bar length is proportional to the values. If the axis does not include zero, this should be clearly indicated with zig-zags on the bars or axis. Negative values can be represented with bars hanging below the axis.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleBar' filePrefix='simpleBar4'>Three-dimensional representations of bar charts should be avoided.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleBar' filePrefix='simpleBar5'>It is misleading to replace simple bars with 2- or 3-dimensional objects whose height represents the values since the visual impression depends on the area or volume of the objects.</page>
<page dir='en/simpleBar' filePrefix='simpleBar6'>For frequency tables describing the distribution of continuous measurements, the bars of a bar chart have their heights equal to the frequencies if all classes have the same width. However this is misleading if the class widths vary and the bar heights must be defined differently.</page>
