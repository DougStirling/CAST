<page dir='en/maps' filePrefix='maps0'>This page is an overview of the section.</page>
<page dir='en/maps' filePrefix='maps1'>The geographic distribution of a measurement can be displayed using different colours on a map.</page>
<page dir='en/maps' filePrefix='maps2'>The choice of colours to represent numerical measurements on a map is important. A continuous graduation involving three contrasting colours or a grouping into classes is usually best.</page>
<page dir='en/maps' filePrefix='maps3'>Shading regions on a map can only represent a single measurement. Drawing a circle on each region can represent both a 'size' measurement with the circle area and another measurement with its colour.</page>
<page dir='en/maps' filePrefix='maps4'>Maps can have other simple bar and pie charts superimposed on each region. Only simple information about each region should be displayed in this way.</page>
<page dir='en/maps' filePrefix='maps5'>In most conventional maps, the areas of the regions are proportional to their land areas. The shapes of the regions can be distorted to make their areas proportional to their populations.</page>
<page dir='en/maps' filePrefix='maps6'>It is sometimes informative to distort a map to make the areas of regions proportional to other measurements. These measurements must be partitions of a meaningful total so that the combined measurement for two regions would be their total.</page>
