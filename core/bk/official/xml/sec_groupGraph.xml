<section name='Comparing groups'>

<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph0'>This page is an overview of the section.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph1'>Data for comparing groups are often displayed in a two-way table with either the rows or columns corresponding to the different groups.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph2'>If the values in each group are partitions of a group total such as a frequency table, a table or bar chart of percentages within the groups highlights the differences.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph3'>The bars can be clustered together by group or by category.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph4'>If there are many groups, stacking the bars often makes it easier to compare the groups.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph5'>If there are only two categories in each group, there is no need to present both proportions. A simple bar chart of one proportion is sufficient and allows the scale to be expanded if the proportion is small for all groups.</page>
<page dir='en/groupGraph' filePrefix='groupGraph6'>Three-dimensional versions of clustered and stacked bar charts make it harder to understand the data and can be misleading.</page>
