<p class="heading">The process of improving systems</p>

  <p>Statistical analysis is often an important part of long-term <strong>monitoring</strong> 
    and <strong>improvement</strong> of the performance of a system. This process 
    is often called <strong>continuous quality improvement</strong> and is particularly 
    important in business and industrial contexts. The approach taken to solving 
    many biological, agricultural and health problems can also be considered to 
    be a process that is aimed at improving the treatment of a disease, the yield 
    of a crop, etc.</p>
	<p>The statistical part of the process again involves a feedback cycle of data 
    collection and analysis, aimed at improving aspects of the system. The following 
    diagram shows a common form of this cycle.</p>
	
	<p class="eqn"><object data="images/pdca.svg" width="463" height="265"></object></p>
	
  <p>Data collection and analysis are an integral part of the Plan-Do-Check-Act 
		cycle.</p>
	<p class="heading">Example: Saving a native bird</p>
	<p>A government conservation department is concerned about declining numbers 
    of a native bird and funding has been allocated to try to reverse this trend. 
    A small team is put together to utilise the funding, and the following is 
    a description of what they did.</p>

				<p>What are possible causes of the problem? And which are most likely 
                to have resulted in the decline in bird numbers?</p>

								<li>Attacks by predators?</li>
								<li>Climate change?</li>
								<li>Disease?</li>
								<li>Changes to the birds' habitat?</li>
							</ul>
				      <p>If possible, collect data about the birds and their behaviour 
                to help with this planning stage, or some data may already exist 
                in records.</p>

                surviving chicks in each nest from these and other trees that 
                were not rat-proofed are recorded in the following season.<br>

	<p class="heading">The statistical process in other contexts</p>

	<p>In many other contexts, a similar cycle is used to obtain 'improvements' 
    in the system. For example, hospitals may be concerned that patients are taking 
    longer to recover from heart surgery. What is the cause? Older patients, changes 
    to surgical procedures, changes to care, ...?</p>
  <p>The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle can be used to determine reasons for the increase 
    and determine ways to improve recovery times.</p>
