<p class="heading">Continuous quality improvement</p>
<p>In many business and industrial contexts, and increasingly in
government, statistical analysis is an important part of long-term <strong>monitoring</strong>
and <strong>improvement</strong> of the performance of the
system. This process is often called <strong>continuous quality
improvement</strong>.</p> <p>The statistical part of
the process again involves a feedback cycle of data collection and
analysis, aimed at improving aspects of the system. The following
diagram shows a common form of this cycle.</p> <p class="eqn"><object data="images/pdca.svg" height="265" width="463"></object></p>
<p>Data collection and analysis are an integral part of the
Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle.</p> <p class="heading">Example:
Shelf life of milk in a supermarket</p> <p>A supermarket
sells thousands of bottles of milk each week, but occasionally gets
complaints from customers about milk going off within a few days of
sale. How should this problem be addressed? A possible scenario is
given below.</p> <table class="centred" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</td> <td> <p>What are possible causes of the
problem? And which are most likely to give rise to the complaints?</p>
<ul> <li>Problems before delivery of the milk to the
supermarket?</li> <li>Delays in putting the milk in
supermarket refrigerators?</li> <li>Poor cycling of the
milk on the shelves so the oldest milk does not get sold first?</li>
<li>Customers not refrigerating their milk soon enough after
purchase?</li> </ul> <p>If possible, collect data
about the complaints and the current system to help with this planning
stage.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>

inspection of milk is started with the oldest milk being moved to the

<p class="heading">The statistical process in other
contexts</p> <p>In many other contexts, a similar cycle is
used to obtain 'improvements' in the system. For example, biologists
may want to increase numbers of an endangered native bird. Why are
numbers decreasing? Predators, disease, habitat, ...?</p> <p>The
Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle can be used to determine reasons for the
decline and obtain remedies.</p> <table class="centred" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="10" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td><strong>A
