<p class=heading>Randomness of data</p>

  <p>Not only do we usually have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data were collected, but we must also acknowledge that our data would have been different if, by chance, we had selected different individuals or even made our measurements at a different time.</p>
  <p>We must acknowledge 
    this sample-to-sample variability when interpreting the data. The data are <strong>random</strong>.</p>
  <center>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
      <tr>
        <td align="center"><strong>All graphical and numerical summaries would 
          be different if we repeated data collection.</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
  <p>This randomness in the data must be taken into account when we interpret graphical and numerical summaries. Our conclusions should not be dependent on features  that are specific to our particular data but would (probably) be different if the data were collected again.</p>

		<p>In an experiment to assess the number of pages that can be printed by a 
			new range of cartridges for an ink jet printer, ten cartridges were tested.</p>

		<p>If the experiment was repeated with a different sample of printer cartridges 
			of the same type, different values would be obtained. Click <strong>Repeat 
			experiment with 10 different cartridges</strong> to see how the recorded 
			data might change.</p>

		<p>The results from a single experiment clearly tell us <strong>something</strong> about the hardness of this type of paver, but how do we take into consideration 
		the randomness?</p>
	  <p>Use the pop-up menu to increase the sample size and repeat.</p>
