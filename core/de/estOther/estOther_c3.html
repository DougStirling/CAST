<p class="heading">Estimating other parameters of a normal population</p>

  <p>In normal populations, the mean, µ, 
		is the parameter that is most often estimated. However numerical distributions 
		have other parameters that may be of interest. For example,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>standard deviation</li>
		<li>interquartile range (upper quartile - lower quartile)</li>
		<li>median</li>
		<li>other percentiles (e.g. the upper quartile)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These parameters can be estimated using the corresponding summary statistic 
		from a random sample, but the error distribution may be difficult to obtain 
		theoretically.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simulation</p>
	<p>Since the parameters µ 
		and σ 
		are unknown, we cannot perform a simulation with repeated samples from the 
		actual population. However we can conduct a simulation from our best estimate 
		of the population distribution &mdash; i.e. replacing µ 
		and σ 
		with the sample mean and standard deviation.</p>
	<p>We repeatedly take samples of size <em>n</em> from this approximate population 
		and evaluate the estimation error from using each sample. (Since we know the 
		population from which we are sampling, we know the population parameter and 
		can find the estimation error.)</p>
	<p>The standard deviation of these errors is the approximate standard error 
		of the estimator.</p>

    <p class=heading>Assets-to-liabilities ratios</p>

	  
    <p>Researchers in Greece found the assets-to-liabilities ratios of a sample 
      of 68 healthy companies. Low assets-to-liabilities ratios are usually regarded 
      as undesirable for a company.</p>

        </table>
      </center>

    <p> In other words, we want to estimate the <strong>lower quartile</strong> 
      of the assets-to-liabilities ratio in the wider population of similar Greek 
      companies.</p>

		<p class=heading>Approximate population</p>
		
    <p>The <strong><strong><strong>assets-to-liabilities ratios</strong></strong></strong> 
      have a fairly symmetric distribution so it is reasonable to try simulating 
      random samples from a normal population. The diagram below shows a normal 
      distribution whose mean and standard deviation equal those of our actual 
      data.</p>
		
    <p class=eqn><object data="images/assetLiabilitiesModel.svg" width="396" height="136"></object></p>
		
    <p>We use this normal distribution as a population from which to sample 68 
      values &mdash; simulated assets-to-liabilities ratios for 68 similar companies. 
      For the normal (1.726,&nbsp;0.639) distribution, the lower quartile is 1.295, 
      so this is the 'target' parameter that is estimated by our simulated samples.

    <p>The diagram initially shows a sample of 68 assets-to-liabilities ratios. 
      The error is the difference between the sample lower quartile and the underlying 
      population parameter, 1.295.</p>
		<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times and observe that the error 
			varies from sample to sample.</p>
		
    <p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then take 100 or more samples (assets-to-liabilities 
      ratios of 68 companies). The error distribution is built up as a stacked 
      dot plot at the bottom of the diagram.</p>

		<p class=heading>Understanding accuracy of estimate</p>

	  
    <p>In the simulation, you should have observed that the bias of the estimator 
      is small, so we will treat it as zero.</p>
    <p>The estimated standard error in your simulation was probably around 0.1. 
      We can use the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb to help interpret its value &mdash; the 
      error has approximately 95% chance of being within 2 s.e. of zero and will 
      be almost certainly within 3 s.e. of zero.</p>
