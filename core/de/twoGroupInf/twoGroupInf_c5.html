<p class="heading">Two-tailed tests for differences</p>

<p>The hypothesis tests on the previous page were appropriate for situations
with some kind of symmetry between our attitudes towards the two groups &mdash; the
alternative hypothesis did not specify any sign for the difference between the population
means. This type of test is a <strong>two-tailed</strong> test since test statistics
in <strong>both</strong> tails of the t distribution suggest that the alternative hypothesis
holds.
</p>

one day, do shoppers at both branches tend to have equally large bills?</td>

material from each loom is counted each day for a month. Does either loom produce
material with fewer flaws?</td>

accounting systems in a different way. From each student's mark in a test, is 
there any evidence about which teaching method is better?</td>

<p class="heading">One-tailed tests for differences</p>

<p>In other situations, we want to test whether one specific group has a <strong>higher</strong>
mean than the other group. Alternatively, we may want to test whether one specific group
has a <strong>lower</strong> mean than the other group. These are called
<strong>one-tailed</strong> tests.

<td>A plumbing firm is concerned about the time it takes some residential customers 
to pay for work. It wonders whether mailing reminders for each overdue account 
more regularly will help encourage customers to pay promptly. Half of the overdue 
accounts are sent monthly reminders (the current practice) and the other half 
are sent reminders fortnightly. Is average time to payment of the accounts <strong>reduced</strong>?</td>

training course. Two weeks after the course, all employees are asked to rate their 
satisfaction with their job on a scale of 0 to 10. Did attendance at the training 
course <strong>improve</strong> job satisfaction? </td>

<p class="heading">Test statistic and p-value</p>

<p>The test statistic for a 1-tailed test is identical to that for a 2-tailed 
test, but the p-value is obtained from only one tail of the t distribution. We 
illustrate below for testing the hypotheses,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="blue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub></strong></span> </p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is only supported by very small values of <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>. 
This also corresponds to small values of the test statistic <em><font color="#000000">t</font></em>, 
so the p-value is the lower tail probability of the t distribution. </p>

<p class="heading">Properties of p-values</p>

<p>We again stress that a statistical hypothesis test cannot provide a definitive 
answer. The randomness of sample data means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>p-values are also random quantities, and</li>
<li>there is some chance of us being misled by an 'unlucky' sample. </li>
</ul>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Simulation when the underlying means are the same (H<sub>0</sub> is true)</p>
<p>The following simulation is like one on the previous page, but a 1-tailed test 
is used to compare the population means. Samples of size 20 are again selected 
from two populations, both of which are normal with mean 75 and standard deviation 
8.</p>

<p>Take several samples and observe the variation in the resulting p-value. Again 
observe that the p-values are <strong>usually</strong> greater than 0.1, so we 
would <strong>usually</strong> conclude that there is no evidence that &mu;<sub>1</sub> 
is higher than &mu;<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>However about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of the p-values are less than 0.1, 
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> are less than 0.05 and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> 
are less than 0.01.</p>
