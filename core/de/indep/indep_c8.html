<p class=heading>Contingency tables from univariate data in several groups</p>

<p>Contingency tables often arise from bivariate categorical data. However they 
can also arise from univariate categorical data that is recorded separately from 
several groups.</p>
<p>'Group membership' can be treated as a second categorical variable.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>Effect of false claims in adverts</p>
<p>In a study to assess how false or misleading adverts affect consumers, one 
group of 100 experimental subjects was exposed to a series of adverts falsely 
claiming that a new brand of coffee contained 'no bitterness'. These subjects 
and another control group of 100 people who had not seen the adverts were given 
a sample of coffee that had been prepared to be intentionally bitter. The contingency 
table below shows<i></i> whether the subjects reported the coffee as 'having bitterness'.</p>

<center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="white">
      <tr>
        <th align="CENTER">&nbsp;</th>
<th align="CENTER"><font color="blue">False advert</font></th>
<th align="CENTER"><font color="blue">No advert</font></th>
<th align="CENTER"><font color="red">Total</font></th></tr>
<tr>
<th align="CENTER"><font color="blue">Coffee described<br>
as bitter</font></th>
<td align="CENTER">68</td>
<td align="CENTER">89</td>
<td align="CENTER"><font color="red">157</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th align="CENTER"><font color="blue">Coffee described as<br>
not bitter</font></th>
<td align="CENTER">32</td>
<td align="CENTER">11</td>
<td align="CENTER"><font color="red">43</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th align="CENTER"><font color="red">Total</font></th>
<td align="CENTER"><font color="red">100</font></td>
<td align="CENTER"><font color="red">100</font></td>
<td align="CENTER"><font color="blue">200</font></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In this example, two different groups of people were used in the experiment. 
The column variable  (distinguishing between the two types of advert) is not a random variable, as it is controlled by the experiment. A single categorical measurement (whether or not the coffee sample was bitter) 
was made from each person.</p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Comparing groups</p>

<p>Although the chi-squared test was motivated as a test of independence of two 
categorical variables, the <strong>same test</strong> can be used when each row 
(or column) of a contingency table corresponds to a separate group of individuals.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Null hypothesis (corresponding to independence)</dt>
<dd>The category probabilities are the same within each group.</dd>
<dt>Alternative hypothesis (corresponding to association)</dt>
<dd>The different groups have different probabilities.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test statistic and p-value are identical to those given earlier for testing independence.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class=heading>Examples</p>
<p>In the following examples, we test whether the 'response' proportions are the 
same in several groups.</p>

<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeSvgImage(this)">
<option value="0" selected>Recruiting source and work success</option>
<option value="1">Bitter coffee and false adverts</option>
<option value="2">Response rates to questionnaire</option>
</select>
</form>

<p align="center"><iframe src="images/recruitTest.svg" id="dataImage" width="541" height="459" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Note again that a visual comparison of the observed counts and those estimated 
from the margins assuming independence helps to explain the nature of the relationship 
in examples where we conclude that there is some difference between the groups.</p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Two groups and two categories</p>

<p>In the special case where there are two groups and the categorical measurement 
has two categories (that we will call 'success' and 'failure'), the chi-squared 
test is testing whether the probability of success is the same in both groups. 
For example, in the Bitter Coffee data set, we are testing whether the probability 
of reporting that the coffee was bitter is the same for the groups seeing the 
false adverts and those who did not.</p>
<p>This hypothesis can also be tested with a <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('twoGroupPropn4')">2-sample 
test of equality of two proportions</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, although the two tests have been motivated in a different way, 
it can be proved that:</p>

<table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td align="center"><strong>The 2-sample test for equality of two proportions and 
the chi-squared test both result in the same p-value and conclusion.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
