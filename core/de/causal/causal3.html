<p class="heading">Is a relationship causal?</p>
<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change. For example, 
if the milk yield of cows is causally affected by a dietary supplement, then yields 
can be increased by changing this supplement. </p>

<tr> 
<td><strong>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
collected. </strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</p>
<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
  <p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Such variables are called <strong>lurking variables</strong> and will be discussed 
    more fully in the next section. Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
    it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>

<p class="heading">Smoking and attendance at college</p>
<p>The following contingency table comes from a survey of 400 males aged 19. </p>

<p class="eqn"><object data="images/smoking.svg" width="333" height="113"></object></p>

<p>A smaller proportion of college students smoke than males who do not attend college.
Also, a smaller proportion of smokers attend college than non-smokers.
</p>

<p>There are three possible interpretations of this relationship between
smoking and college attendance.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smoking directly affects education. <font color=black>Perhaps nicotine makes it harder to learn?
  If so, stopping smoking would be likely to improve a student's chances of going to college.</font>
  <br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Education directly affects smoking. <font color=black>This would be true if going to college (and mixing
  with other college students) discouraged students from smoking.</font>
  <br>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Lurking variables affect both smoking and attendance at college. <font color=black>For 
        example, genetic and environmental characteristics of students may determine 
        both whether they smoke and whether they attend college. Changing one 
        variable would not affect the other.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>The data cannot help to resolve the issue of causation so it would be incorrect 
to report any causal relationship from these data.</p>
