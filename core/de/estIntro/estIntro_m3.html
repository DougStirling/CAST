<p class="heading">Interest in a single population parameter</p>

  <p>Although we sometimes want to fully discover a population distribution, in 
		most applications we are mainly interested in a single parameter of this distribution. 
		Estimating a population parameter is more focused and there is a well-established 
		body of statistical theory to support it.</p>
	<center>
		<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
			<tr> 
				<td><strong>To estimate a population parameter from a sample, we usually 
					use the corresponding sample statistic.<strong> </strong></strong></td>
			</tr>

	</center>
	<p>Some scenarios are presented below where estimating a population proportion 
		or mean (using a corresponding sample statistic) might be justified. </p>

  <p class=heading>Proportion of farmers growing sorghum</p>
    <p>Because of possible climate change, some farmers in a mainly maize-growing 
			district of Africa have started growing sorghum in some of their fields.</p>
  <p>The Ministry of Agriculture is interested in estimating the proportion of 
    farmers who are currently growing sorghum. It is known that there are 3535 
    farms in the district but collecting information from all farms would be very 
    expensive, so data are collected from a random sample of 100 farms.</p>
  <center>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
      <tr> 
          <td><strong>The sample proportion, <em>p</em>, of farmers growing sorghum 
						is an estimate of the unknown population proportion, π.</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
    <p>It was found that 37 out of the 100 sampled farms used sorghum, so our 
      estimate of the proportion using the crop in the <strong>whole</strong> 
      district is</p>

		<p class=heading>Average area growing sorghum</p>
    <p>Studies often have multiple objectives. In the survey described above, 
			the Ministry is also interested in the current average area under sorghum 
			for those farmers who are currently growing that crop. Data collected from 
			the 37 farms in which sorghum is used can provide an estimate.</p>
    <center>
			<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
				<tr> 
					<td><strong>The sample mean area devoted to sorghum in farms where sorghum 
						is grown, <em><img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"></em>, 
						is an estimate of the unknown population mean, </strong>µ<strong>.</strong></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</center>
		<p>In the 37 farms growing sorghum, the average area devoted to sorghum was 
			0.68 hectares, so we estimate the average area in sorghum-growing farms 
			in the <strong>whole</strong> district to be</p>
			
		<p class=eqn>
			<object data="../HestIntro/images/meanEst.svg" width="52" height="21" align="absmiddle">
			</object>
			0.68 <em>hectares</em></p>
		<p class=heading>Total area growing sorghum in district</p>
		<p>The sample data above can also be used to estimate the total area growing 
			sorghum in all 3535 farms in the district. The total area in the 100 sampled 
			farms was</p>
		<p class=eqn>37 <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">x</font> 
			0.68 &nbsp;= &nbsp;26.16<em> hectares</em></p>
		<p>We therefore estimate the total area in the whole 3535 farms in the district 
			to be</p>
		<p class=eqn>26.16 <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">x</font> 
			<sup>3535</sup>/<sub>100</sub> &nbsp;= &nbsp;889&nbsp;<em>hectares</em></p>
		<p class=heading>Comparing beers</p>

<p>A brewery wishes to assess the effect of an additive on the alcohol content of its
premium beer. Several batches are brewed, both with and without the additive, and the
alcohol content of each batch is recorded. We therefore have two random samples; one
from a hypothetical population of alcohol contents of batches brewed with the additive,
and the other from the corresponding hypothetical population without the additive.
</p>

<p>We could estimate the two population distributions and attempt to compare them. However
the brewer's interest is mostly about whether the alcohol content increases or decreases
with the additive, and this can be phrased in terms of the two population means
-- are they different?
</p>

<p class=eqn><object data="images/equalMeans.svg" width="409" height="158" alt="comparing beer"></object>
</p>

    <p>The sample means provide estimates of the corresponding population means 
			and are the basis for answering the question. </p>
