<p class="heading">Normal errors</p>
<p>Another assumption in the normal linear model is that the model errors are 
  normally distributed.</p>
<p class=eqn style="color:#000000">ε &nbsp; ~ &nbsp; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">normal</font> (0, σ) </p>
<p>If the model holds, the least squares residuals will also be normally distributed, 
  so a histogram of the residuals can be examined for normality.</p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Normal errors are the least important of the model assumptions. If 
      the other assumptions hold, it is reasonable to continue with the analysis, even 
      if the errors have a skew distribution.</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="heading">Normal probability plot</p>
<p>A better way to graphically examine a data set for normality is with a <strong><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('normalDistn10')">normal 
  probability plot</a></strong> of the residuals. As with other probability plots, if the residuals are from a normal distribution, the crosses in the normal probability 
  plot should lie close to a straight line.</p>
<p class="heading">How much curvature is needed to suggest non-normality?</p>
<p>In some data sets, linearity or nonlinearity in the probability plot is 
  clear. In practice however, the randomness of real data means that the probability 
  plot will not be exactly straight even for values that are sampled from a normal 
  population.</p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>How much curvature is needed to conclude that the underlying distribution 
      is not normal?</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer. There are formal tests of normality 
  that can be used in conjunction with a probability plot. (We <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('testPValue5')">discussed 
    one in an earlier chapter</a> about hypothesis tests.) We however take a less 
  formal approach in the example below.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Share prices and volume traded</p>
<p>The scatterplot below shows the volume of British Airways shares traded in 
each of the first 57 trading days of 2002 &mdash; between 2nd January and 21st March 
-- and the closing share price. A probability plot of the residuals from the least 
squares line are also shown on the right.</p>

<p>There is curvature in the probability plot, suggesting that the error distribution 
is skew with a long tail towards the high values.</p>
<p>Could this amount of curvature have occurred by chance? Select <strong>Random 
Normal Data</strong> from the pop-up menu to generate random data from a normal 
linear model whose parameters β<sub>0</sub>, 
β<sub>1 </sub>and σ are the same as the least squares estimates from our data. Click <strong>Take 
Sample</strong> several times to see the variability in the probability plot when 
a normal linear model <strong>does</strong> hold.</p>
<p>The probability plot from the data seems more curved than the random ones, 
suggesting a problem with the model assumptions.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Warning</p>
<p>If the assumptions of linearity and constant variance are violated, or if there 
are outliers, the probability plot of residuals will often be curved, irrespective 
of the error distribution.</p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Only draw a probability plot if you are sure that the data are linear, 
have constant variance and have no outliers.</strong></td>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Share price and volume traded</p>
<p>In the British Airways example above, there appears to be greater variability 
in the volumes traded when the share price is high. This suggests that a transformation 
of the response might improve the fit of the model. The scatterplot below shows 
that a normal linear model would be a better description of the relationship between 
the logarithms of the volume traded and the share price &mdash; the distribution of 
points around the line is more symmetrical and there are no obvious problems with 
the other assumptions.</p>
