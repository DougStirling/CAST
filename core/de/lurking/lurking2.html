<p class="heading">Relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable</p>  
	<p>The previous page showed that the marginal relationship between two numerical 
		variables, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, can be very different from their conditional 
		relationship for specific values of <em>Z</em>. The same can happen when <em>X</em> 
		is a categorical variable. </p>
	<p class="heading">Marginal and conditional relationships</p>
	<p>When <em>X</em> is categorical (splitting the data into groups), there are 
		again two different types relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>, 
		depending on whether or not we make use of a third variable, <em>Z</em>.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Marginal relationship</dt>
		<dd>This is the observed relationship, ignoring any additional information 
			that is available. The relationship can be summarised by the means of <em>Y</em> 
			for the different groups (values of <em>X</em>).</dd>
		<dt>Conditional relationships, given <em>Z</em></dt>
		<dd>These conditional relationships are described in the same way as the marginal 
			relationship above, but are based on a subset of individuals with a particular 
			value of <em>Z</em>.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The marginal relationship can again be very different from the conditional 
		relationships, even changing 'direction'. This will be clearer in an example.</p>

		<p>Since the mean <em>sale price</em> is lower in 2004, it is tempting to 
			conclude that house prices have fallen during the year. (This is the marginal 
			relationship between sale price and year.)</p>
		<p>Click the checkbox <strong>Slice</strong>. The variable <em>district</em> 
			is a lurking variable that splits the town into four districts and the diagram 
			now shows the conditional relationship for one district. Drag the slider 
			and observe that the mean sale price of housing actually <em>increased</em> 
			within each district.</p>

<dl>
			<dt>Marginal relationship between <em>sale price</em> and <em>year</em></dt>
<dd>The overall decrease in mean sale price is useful information, but is caused 
by an increase in the proportion of sales in the poorer districts of the town.</dd>
			<dt>Conditional relationship for each <em>district</em></dt>
<dd>The increase in mean price in individual districts is a better indication 
that the prices of individual houses have increased &mdash; your own house is likely 
to be worth more!</dd>
