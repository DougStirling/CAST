<p class="heading">Additive models</p>

  <p>The models that we have considered in earlier sections have been <strong>additive 
		models</strong>, and there has been an implicit assumption that the different 
		components affected the time series additively.</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#009"><strong>Data &nbsp; = &nbsp; Seasonal effect &nbsp; + &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; + &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; + &nbsp; Residual</strong></p>
	<p>For monthly data, an additive model assumes that the difference between the 
		January and July values is approximately the same each year. In other words, 
		the <strong>amplitude</strong> of the seasonal effect is the same each year.</p>
	<p>The model similarly assumes that the residuals are roughly the same size 
		throughout the series &mdash; they are a random component that adds on to the other 
		components in the same way at all parts of the series.</p>
	<p class="heading">Multiplicative models</p>
	<p>In many time series involving <strong>quantities</strong> (e.g. money, wheat 
		production, ...), the absolute differences in the values are of less interest 
		and importance than the percentage changes.</p>
	<p>For example, in seasonal data, it might be more useful to model that the 
		July value is the same <strong>proportion</strong> higher than the January 
		value in each year, rather than assuming that their difference is constant. 
		Assuming that the seasonal and other effects act proportionally on the series 
		is equivalent to a <strong>multiplicative model</strong>,</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#009"><strong>Data &nbsp; = &nbsp; (Seasonal effect) &nbsp; × &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; × &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; × &nbsp; Residual</strong></p>
	<p>Fortunately, multiplicative models are equally easy to fit to data as additive 
		models! The trick to fitting a multiplicative model is to take logarithms 
of both sides of the model,</p>
	<table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="color:#009; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
		<tr>
			<td valign="top" rowspan="2"><strong>log(Data) &nbsp;</strong></td>
			<td align="left" valign="top"><strong>= &nbsp; log(Seasonal effect &nbsp; × &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; × &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; × &nbsp; Residual)</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="left" valign="top"><strong>= &nbsp; log(Seasonal effect) &nbsp;+ &nbsp;log(Trend) &nbsp;+ &nbsp;log(Cyclical) &nbsp;+ &nbsp;log(Residual)</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>After taking logarithms (either natural logarithms or to base 10), the four 
	components of the time series again act additively.</p>
	<center>
		<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white" width="400">
			<tr> 
				<th align="CENTER">To fit a multiplicative model, take logarithms of the 
					data, then analyse the log data as before.</th>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</center>
	<p>It is important to recognise when multiplicative models are appropriate. 
		However fitting the models is no harder than fitting additive models.</p>

  <p class="heading">Illustrative example</p>

		<p>In the following time series, the values increase by 20% each year, except 
      for two years &mdash; 1983 and 1998 &mdash; in each of which the values <strong>decrease</strong> 
      by 20%. </p>

		<p>In a plot of the raw data, 1998 appears more unusual than 1983. Indeed, 
			it is easy to miss the fact that 1983 is an unusual year.</p>
		<p>Since we consider 1983 and 1998 to be equally unusual because they have 
			the same <strong>proportional</strong> change from the previous year, so 
			a multiplicative model is suggested.</p>
		<p>Drag the slider to <strong>Log scale</strong>. The applies a logarithmic 
			transformation to the data. Observe that both unusual years appear the same 
			on a log scale. Note also that the transformation linearises the trend in 
			the series, making it easier to model.</p>

  <p class="heading">Personal disposable income</p>

		<p>The time series plot below shows how US personal disposable income (in 
			billions of dollars) changed between 1959 and 2001.</p>

		<p>In this period, personal disposable incomes have increased considerably, 
			so a same percentage increase that would be quite noticable in 2001 would 
			be hard to recognise on a plot of the raw data in 1959.</p>
		<p>Drag the slider to <strong>Log scale</strong>. Observe that the trend is 
      fairly linear until about 1985, implying a constant percentage increase 
      each year. However there has been a flattening out of the time series in 
      recent years &mdash; the annual percentage increase in personal disposable income 
      has become smaller.</p>
		<p class="heading">Visitor arrivals in New Zealand</p>
		<p>Our final example is a seasonal time series. The plot below describes the 
			numbers of short-term visitor arrivals in New Zealand (in thousands) each 
			quarter from 1980 to 2001.</p>

		<p>Observe that the seasonal component affects this series multiplicatively 
			-- in earlier years when the visitor numbers were small, the differences 
			between the quarters were also small.</p>

		<p>Apply a logarithmic transformation to the data, and observe that the seasonal 
			variation now becomes more constant. A multiplicative model is therefore 
			appropriate, and the data can be analysed by fitting an additive model to 
			the log visitor numbers.</p>
