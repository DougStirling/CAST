<p class=heading>Samples instead of individual values</p>

<p>Although control charts for individual values are sometimes used, it is more
common to examine <strong>samples</strong> from a process at regular intervals
rather than individual values. There are a few reasons:
</p>

<ul>
	
  <li>It is easier and cheaper to make several measurements at once &mdash; for example, 
    sampling 12 items from a production line every 2 hours instead of a single 
    item every 10 minutes. <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
	
  <li>The control limits at 3 standard deviations on each side of the mean work 
    best when the distribution of values is close to a normal distribution. Sample 
    means <strong>always</strong> have a distribution that is closer to normal 
    than the individual values. <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
	
  <li>There are two ways in which a process can go out of control. Special causes 
    may either change the process mean or increase its variability. From each 
    sample, we can estimate both location and spread, making it easier to look 
    for changes in both location and variability.</li>
</ul>

<p class=heading>Control chart for means</p>

<p>We first consider detection of whether the <strong>mean output level of a process</strong> 
  is changing, based on a run chart of the means of successive samples. Sample 
  means of <em>n</em> values vary less from sample to sample than individual values, 
  and have standard deviation</p>

<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position:relative; top:12px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline"></span>

<p>The control limits for a control chart of sample means are therefore... </p>

<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:-12px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> <span class="black">&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp; 3</span></span><img src="../../images/symbol.sOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline">
</p>

<p>where <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> 
  and <em>s</em> 
  are estimates of the mean and standard deviation of individual values when the 
  process is in control. These control limits should be distinguished carefully 
  from the corresponding control limits for individual values, </p>

<p class=eqn><img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> <span class="black">&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp; 3<em>s</em></span> 
</p>

<p>Since the control limits used in a control chart for means are closer to <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> 
  than those in a control chart for individual values, the chart is more sensitive 
  to changes in the process mean over time.</p>
<p class=heading>Training data</p>

<p>In order to obtain control limits, we must know the mean and standard deviation 
  of the measurements when the process is 'in control'. These are usually estimated 
  from a set of 'training samples' in which great care is taken to avoid special 
  causes. </p>

<p>The process mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> 
  is estimated by the mean value from the training samples. We will initially 
  use the standard deviation of the training sample as our estimate, <em>s</em>, 
  but will describe a better estimate at the end of this page.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
  <p class=heading>Paint primer thickness</p>
  <p>The diagram below shows thickness of paint primer in mils (an imperial measurement 
    equal to one thousandth of an inch), measured from a sample of 10 items each 
    morning and afternoon for 5 successive mornings and afternoons. We will regard 
    these data as a training set from which we obtain control limits for later 
    samples of primer thickness. </p>

we use a small real data set for illustration.)</font></p>

<p>The control limits that are initially shown are those for a run chart of individual
values &mdash; mean&nbsp;Â±&nbsp;3&nbsp;standard deviations for the 50 values in the
training data.
</p>

<p>Use the scroll bar to display the samples that were measured over the next 15 half-days.
No values are outside the 3-standard deviations limits, so we would conclude that the
process is in control.
</p>

<p>Now click the checkbox <strong>Show Means</strong>. The raw values
in the samples are dimmed and the sample means are displayed, joined by blue lines. The sample
means are considerably less variable than the raw values, so the control limits are redrawn
closer to the centre line.
</p>

<p>Based on the means, we again conclude that there is no evidence of a shift in the
process mean.
</p>

</div>

<p>As in control charts for individual values, additional triggers can be used that depend
on several successive means. These are defined in the same way as those in control charts
for individual values. For example, six successive sample means either increasing
or decreasing suggest that there might be a special cause.
</p>
<p class=heading>Better estimate of <em>s</em> from training samples (advanced)</p>

<p>A different estimate of the process standard deviation, <em>s</em>, 
  is usually preferred to the overall standard deviation of the values in the 
  training samples.</p>
<p>Instead, <em>s</em> 
  is usually estimated from the standard deviations <strong>within</strong> each 
  of the training samples. We denote the standard deviations of the <i>k</i> training 
  samples, each of size <em>n</em>, by <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>, 
  ..., <i>s<sub>k</sub></i>. The most commonly used estimate of <em>s</em> 
  is... </p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" width="98" height="60">
</p>

<p>where the value <i>c<sub>4</sub></i>(<em>n</em>) is a constant that depends 
  on the sample size in each of the <em>k</em> samples, <i>n</i>. Its value may 
  be obtained from tables or using the formulae </p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/controlChart/images/sdConstantEqn.gif" width="265" height="72">
</p>

<p>The second part of this formula allows the value of <i>c<sub>4</sub></i> for sample size
<i>n</i> to be obtained from its value for sample size <i>n</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1, as illustrated
below.
</p>

<em>s</em>
that is occasionally used is

</p>

<p>Although this estimate is better when the data have a reasonably symmetric 
  distribution, the earlier estimate is more 'robust' to problems in the training 
  data.) </p>
