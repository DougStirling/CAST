<p class="heading">Additional triggers for an out-of-control process </p>

<p>The most commonly used indication of a process being out-of-control is a  
  value outside the upper and lower control limits (more than three standard deviations 
  away from the centre line). This is sensitive to changes to the process mean 
  or increases in the process variability. </p>

<p>However additional triggers have been proposed that are also sensitive to systematic
changes in a process. These are all based
on successive values within 1 standard deviation (Zone C), 2 standard deviations (Zone B)
or 3 standard deviations (Zone A) from the specified centre.
</p>

<p>The five most commonly used indications that a process is out of control
are described in the diagram below.

<p>Use the pop-up menu below for a description and example of
the five triggers.

The red dots are values that trigger one of the indications that have
been described. Try to determine which of the indications have been triggered
before clicking on the dot for verification.
