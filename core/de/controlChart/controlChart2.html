<p class=heading>Inherent variability</p>

<p>When a production process is monitored, there is usually variability in the 
  output. A certain level of variability is unavoidable, at least without substantial 
  changes to the process. In the terminology of quality control, we say that this 
  'acceptable' level of variability is a result of <strong>common causes</strong> 
  (or <strong>random causes</strong>). If this is the only source of variability, 
  the process is said to be <strong>in control</strong>. </p>
<p class=heading>Systematic changes</p>
<p>Our aim is to detect changes to the output that are <strong>not</strong> the 
  result of common causes. Such systematic changes are said to be the result of 
  <strong>special causes</strong> (or <strong>assignable causes</strong>) and 
  could result in... </p>

<ul>
	<li>movement in the process mean (either abruptly or steadily over time),</li>
	<li>single outliers, or</li>
	<li>changes to the process variability</li>
</ul>

<p>Systematic changes usually indicate problems with the quality of the output. 
</p>
<p class=heading>Run chart</p>

<p>Successive measurements are recorded at regular intervals as part of the process 
  monitoring. These values are used to detect special causes so that the process 
  can be quickly adjusted to maintain quality. </p>

<p>In a <strong>control chart</strong>, values are plotted in time order, giving 
  a type of time-series plot. As each value is plotted, it is compared to earlier 
  points and, depending on the value, it may be taken as a warning that the process 
  is <strong>out of control</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest kind of control chart occurs when an individual measurement is 
made from the process at regular intervals. The plot of these measurements against 
time is called a <strong>run chart</strong>. The challenge is to detect systematic 
changes in the run chart (due to special causes) over the background level of 
variability (due to common causes). </p>

  <p class=heading>Milk carton filling</p>

<p>A milk bottling factory fills plastic cartons with a nominal 2 litres of milk.
Randomness in the filling process means that the actual volume varies from carton to
carton. The manager has determined that it is possible to achieve a mean volume of
2040&nbsp;ml with almost all cartons holding between 2000 and 2080&nbsp;ml; variability
within this range is considered to be due to common causes.

  <p>The diagram above shows the successive milk volumes in cartons that were 
    sampled from the process output during one shift. Drag the slider to display 
    the values in the order that they were recorded. <font color="#666666">Click 
    on individual crosses to see the milk volume (g) in the individual sampled 
    cartons.</font> </p>

<p>Lines have been drawn on the plot at 2000 and 2080&nbsp;ml. Values outside these limits
are displayed in red &mdash; they might be taken to indicate special causes.
</p>

  <p>The process starts 'in control' with variation that seems to conform to common 
    causes. However between observations 30 and 70 there seems to be an increasing 
    trend in the process. At observation 70, the operators checked the filling 
    machine and found a loose valve which was tightened. The final observations 
    again seem to conform to common causes with the possible exception of observation 
    76 which was unusually low though no special cause could be found for this 
    outlier. </p>

<p>Use the scroll bar to again look at the observations in the order they arise. <strong>How
soon would you detect the increasing trend?</strong>
