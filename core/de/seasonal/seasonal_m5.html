<p class="heading">Further analysis of the deseasonalised data</p>
	<p>The first step in analysing seasonal data is usually to remove the seasonal 
  effect.</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#009; font-weight:bold">Data &nbsp; = &nbsp; Seasonal effect &nbsp; + &nbsp; Deseasonalised</p>
	<p>However we should next examine the deseasonalised data for trend and cyclical 
		features. Using the methods in the first two sections of this chapter, we 
		can obtain trend and cyclical components. What is left after removing these 
		are the residuals.</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#009; font-weight:bold"><span class="eqn" style="color:#009; font-weight:bold">Deseasonalised</span>&nbsp; = &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; + &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; + &nbsp; Residual</p>
	<p>Putting these together, we can identify <strong>four</strong> separate components 
		to the variation in our original time series.</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#009; font-weight:bold"><span class="eqn" style="color:#009; font-weight:bold">Data</span>&nbsp; = &nbsp; <span class="eqn" style="color:#009; font-weight:bold">Seasonal effect &nbsp; + &nbsp; </span>Trend &nbsp; + &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; + &nbsp; Residual</p>
	<p>It is important that you understand the distinction between these four components 
		of a seasonal time series:</p>
  <dl> 
		<dt>Seasonal effect</dt>
		<dd>For monthly or quarterly data, this component repeats in exactly the same 
			way each year.</dd>
		<dt>Trend</dt>
		<dd>This component changes smoothly over the whole time period of the data. 
      It is often described by a linear or quadratic model.</dd>
		<dt>Cyclical</dt>
		<dd>This component describes peaks and troughs that last for several data 
			values. The component includes both long-term cycles and short-term autocorrelation 
			of a few adjacent values.</dd>
		<dt>Residual</dt>
		<dd>This component is what is left. It reflects 'unusual' individual data 
			values that cannot be explained by the other effects.</dd>
	</dl>

		<p>Initially, the blue line in the top half of the diagram connects the raw 
			data points. Click the checkbox <strong>Seasonal</strong> to delete the 
			seasonal effect from this diagram and display it in the bottom half of the 
			diagram.<font color="#666666"> (The mean has been added to the seasonal 
			effects to allow them to be plotted against the same axis as the data.)</font> 
			The top diagram therefore shows the deseasonalised data and the bottom shows 
			the seasonal effects.</p>
		<p>There is virtually no trend or autocorrelation in the deseasonalised data. However  also click the checkboxes <strong>Trend</strong> and <strong>Cyclical</strong> to remove these components from the top series and add them to the bottom. (There is very little change.) What remains in the top is the residuals.</p>
		<p>Selecting the components one-at-a-time allows them to be displayed separately 
			in the bottom half of the diagram.</p>
