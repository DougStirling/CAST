<p class="heading">Normal distribution parameters</p>

<p>The <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('infPopn3')">family of 
normal distributions</a> consists of symmetric bell-shaped distributions that 
are defined by two parameters, µ 
and σ. 
The mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution are equal to µ 
and σ, 
respectively.</p>
<p class="heading">Normal distributions as models for data</p>
<p>A normal distribution is sometimes used as a population to model the variability 
in a data set. (The data are assumed to be a random sample from this population.) 
On the basis of a single set of data, there is rarely enough information about 
the shape of the underlying distribution to be <strong>sure</strong> that a normal 
distribution is the 'correct' population, but it is often a close enough approximation.</p>


<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Teabag weight</p>

<p>The data histogram below shows the weights of 50 teabags that were filled by 
one machine in an hour. It is important to the company to both ensure that the 
average weight of the teabags is over the nominal 5.5 grams per bag and to ensure 
that the variability of the weights is as small as possible &mdash; customer satisfaction 
will be affected if there are badly underfilled teabags.</p>

<p>There are only 50 observations, so it is impossible to be sure of the shape 
of the underlying population distribution. However the histogram is not badly 
skew, so a normal distribution is a reasonable model.</p>
<p>Adjust the normal parameters with the sliders to match the shapes of the histogram 
and normal curve as closely as possible. </p>

</div>

  <p>Many data sets cannot be modelled by a normal distribution. A normal distribution 
		would <strong>not</strong> be an appropriate model for ... </p>

<ul>
  <li>data that are discrete (counts)</li>
  <li>data that have a skew distribution (with long tail to the left or right)</li>
  <li>data that have very long tails (with most values close to the centre, but a small
  proportion of values very far from the mean).</li>
  <li>data that contain two or more clusters of values.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Data with skew distributions can often be <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('transform5')">transformed 
    into a fairly symmetrical form</a>. A normal distribution may be a reasonable 
    model for the <strong>transformed</strong> data. </p>

<p>A more important reason for the importance of the normal distribution in statistics 
is that...</p>

<p>We demonstrated earlier that
<a href="javascript:showNamedPage('randomMean5')">the mean of a random sample has a distribution 
that is close to normal</a> when the sample size is moderate or large, <strong>irrespective 
of the shape of the distribution of the individual values</strong>.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the distributions of the following summary statistics are 
approximately normal when sample size is moderate or large...</p>
<ul>
<li>A sample proportion</li>
<li>The slope and intercept of a least squares line</li>
<li>The difference between the means of two samples</li>
<li>The difference between two proportions</li>
</ul>
<p>Since most statistical methods require an understanding of the variability 
of such summary statistics, it is important that you become familiar with the 
properties of normal distributions.</p>
