  <dl>
    <dt>Experiment on debtors</dt>
    <dd>A dentist wants to assess whether a friendly letter or a threatening letter 
      (the experimental treatment) is more effective at getting debtors to pay 
      their bills. The experimental units are the debtors and they vary in age, 
      gender and other characteristics that also affect their likelihood of responding 
      to the letter.</dd>
    <dt>Experiment on shops</dt>
    <dd>The shops in a supermarket chain have different floor areas and are located 
      in towns with different socio-economic characteristics. Even with no extra 
      advertising (the treatment), weekly sales will vary from supermarket to 
      supermarket.</dd>
    <dt>Experiment on flowers grown in a greenhouse</dt>
    <dd>Some plants will be nearer to the windows, heat sources, ventilation, 
      etc, than others. Some plants will also be naturally more vigorous than 
      others.</dd>
    <dt>Experiment about chemical reaction</dt>
    <dd>In an experiment to assess the effect of an enzyme (the treatment) on a chemical 
reaction, the reaction will be repeated several times 
with different amounts of enzyme. The successive runs of the experiment are the experimental units and, although he experimenter will try to keep experimental 
conditions as constant as possible, some of aspects may change over the course of the experiment &mdash; the 
temperature may change during the day or the technician may improve the experimental 
technique in some subtle way.</dd>

    <p class=heading>Speed of checkout operators</p>

    <p>An experiment is to be conducted to estimate how much time is saved in 
      supermarket checkouts by employing packers to fill groceries into bags for 
      the customers. Sixteen checkout operators are available for use in the experiment 
      and speeds are measured in seconds per dollar value of the purchased goods 
      over a 3-hour period on Saturday. The checkout operators vary in their age 
      and experience, as shown in the scatterplot below.</p>
    <p>We initially consider the speeds of the checkout operators if<strong> none 
      </strong>of the checkout operators use a packer. Even without packers, the 
      speeds of the operators will vary and some of this variability is likely 
      to be related to their age and experience.</p>

    <p>The diagram is 3-dimensional, so move the mouse to the centre (marked by 
      either a pink circle or the pointer changing to a hand) and drag towards 
      the top left to rotate. (Or click the <strong>y-x-z</strong> rotation button.) 
      The third dimension shows speeds of the operators.</p>
    <p>Click the <strong>y-x</strong> and the <strong>y-z</strong> rotation buttons 
      and observe that speed is associated with both age and experience. (The 
      operators who are older and have more experience tend to be faster.)</p>
    <p>Click <strong>Repeat experiment</strong> to run the experiment with a similar 
      group of checkout operators with the same ages and experiences.</p>

    <p>We want to use the data to assess the effect of <strong>using a packer</strong> 
      on speed so the effect of age and experience only serves to complicate the 
      experiment.</p>
