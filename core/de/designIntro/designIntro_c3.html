<p class="heading">Bad experimental design</p>
  <p>We  noted earlier that the experimental units often have considerable variability. If the treatments are allocated to experimental units in a way that is associated with their characteristics, these varying characteristics can distort the apparent relationship between the treatments and the response.</p>
  
	<p class="eqn"><object data="images/lurking2.svg" width="297" height="120"></object></p>
  
	<p>In a badly designed experiment, the characteristics of the experimental units act in the same way as lurking variables in observational studies.</p>
  <p class="heading">Good experimental design</p>
  <p>Since variability in the experimental units is usually unavoidable, we cannot 
		prevent their effect on the response. However, in an experiment it is possible 
		to allocate treatments to the experimental units in a way that either eliminates, 
		or at least reduces, the relationship between the treatment, <em>X</em>, and 
		characteristics of the experimental units. </p>

		<p>The diagram below relates to the same 16 supermarket checkout operators who 
			were examined on the previous page. In the experiment, the 8 operators who choose 
			to work on a Saturday morning shift will be provided with a packer to load customer 
			bags &mdash; the other 8 operators who work in the afternoon shift that day will pack 
			customer bags themselves (the 'control' group). We will conduct a simulation of 
			this experiment in which <strong>the packer decreases packing time by exactly 0.1 seconds 
				per dollar</strong>.</p>
		<p>The circles on the left of the diagram below represent the 16 operators 
			with their initial ages represented by the colours of the circles.</p>

		<p>Click <strong>Allocate treatments</strong> to simulate the selection of 
			eight of the operators to go on the morning shift (and be given the packer). 
			Now click <strong>Run experiment</strong> to simulate the speeds of the 
			operators in 3 hours.</p>
		<p>Repeat the experiment a few times and observe that most runs of the experiment 
			estimate the effect of the packer to be a decrease in packing time of between 0.12 
			and 0.18 seconds per dollar.</p>

		</table>
		<p>The problem lies in the method of choosing the operators who got a packer. 
			Checkout operators working in the morning tend to be older than those 
			in the afternoon, so it is older operators who tend to get the packer.</p>
		<p>We saw on the previous page that older checkout operators tend to be 
			faster so the operators getting packers will tend to be faster even if the 
			packer does not affect speed.</p>
		<p class="heading">Difference in speeds if there was no packer effect</p>
		<p>The reason for the misleading results is clearer in the following simulation 
			in which the packer has <strong>zero effect</strong>.</p>
