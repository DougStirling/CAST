<p>In this page, we discuss the reasons for using randomised blocks when designing 
		an experiment to compare several treatments.</p>

  <p class="heading">Goal of reducing unexplained variability</p>

  <p>When an experiment is conducted to compare several treatments, the greater 
		the unexplained variation in the response measurement, the less accurately 
		we can compare the treatments. In practice, there are two main ways to reduce 
		unexplained variation:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Use experimental units that are as similar as possible.</dt>
		<dd>If all experimental units were identical and the response measurement 
			was completely determined by the treatment applied, we would only need a 
			single repetition of the experiment for each treatment to compare the treatments. 
			In practice, this ideal is impossible but similar experimental units gives 
			best accuracy.</dd>
		<dt>Group the experimental units into blocks so that those in each block are 
			similar.</dt>
		<dd>When it is impossible to avoid variability in the experimental units, 
			it may be possible to group them into blocks of similar units. These blocks 
			'explain' some of the variability, so the unexplained variability is reduced.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class="heading">Randomised block experiments</p>
	<p>The simplest way to use blocks in an experiment is with a <strong>randomised 
		block design</strong>. In this, the block size is a multiple of the number 
		of treatments. Each treatment is used for the same number of experimental 
		units within each block, with the treatments randomly allocated to units within 
		the blocks.</p>
	<p class="heading">Example in which similar experimental units cannot be found</p>
	<p>In the following randomised block experiment, variability between the experimental 
		units was unavoidable, though groups of similar experimental units could be 
		obtained. </p>
	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Amino acid uptake by fish</p>

		<p>In an investigation into the effect of NaCN (sodium cyanide) on the uptake 
			<em>in vitrio</em> of a particular amino acid by intestinal preparations 
			from a certain species of fish, it was found that each fish would only give 
			about six preparations. The measurements of amino acid uptake (expressed 
			as Âµmol g<sup>-1</sup> dry weight per 20 min period) were found to 
			vary considerably between fish.</p>
		<p>A randomised block experiment was therefore conducted in which six preparations 
			(the experimental units) were obtained from each fish (the blocks). Three 
			of the experimental units within each block were randomly chosen to get 
			NaCN and the other three were controls that did not get NaCN.</p>

		<p>As in the example on the previous page, an incorrect analysis that ignores

  <p class="heading">Intentional variability in the experimental units</p>

  <p>Even for experiments in which it is possible to use very similar experimental 
		units, it is not always desireable to do so. If all experimental units are 
		identical, it is difficult to generalise the results to <strong>other kinds 
		of experimental units</strong>.</p>
	<p>Using a variety of different experimental units (grouped into blocks) allows 
		results to be generalised more easily &mdash; we can be more confident that the 
		results will hold for a variety of different types of experimental unit.</p>

 		<p class="heading">Penicillin production</p>

		<p>In the example below, a process for manufacture of penicillin was being 
			investigated. Four variants of the basic process (A, B, C and D) were being 
			studied and the response measurement was the yield of penicillin.</p>
		<p>An important raw material for the process was corn steep liquor, and this 
			was quite variable. Instead of conducting the experiment with only one blend 
			of corn steep liquor, it was therefore decided to use five different blends 
			(blocks) in order to ensure that the results were not specific to one particular 
			blend. Four different runs of the experiment were used with each blend, 
			with the four process variants randomly allocated to the runs.</p>
