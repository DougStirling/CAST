<p class="heading">Differences between blocks and treatments</p>

  <p>For randomised block data, the response measurement depends on both the treatment 
    and block membership. There are major differences between the concepts of 
    blocks and treatments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blocks are a grouping of the experimental units whereas treatments are 
      allocated by the researcher.</li>
    <li>We are mainly interested in comparing the treatments. Variability between 
			blocks is nuisance variation that we often try to avoid.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="heading">Similarities between blocks and treatments</p>
  <p>However from a model-building perspective, blocks and treatments are modelled 
    in the same way. We assume that the response is affected by both the block 
    and the treatment in an additive way:</p>
  <table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
    <tr> 
      <td align="center"><font color="#000000"><em><strong>y</strong></em><strong> 
        = (overall mean) + (effect depending on block)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + (effect depending on 
        treatment) + error</strong></font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
	
  <p>As in earlier models, the error is assumed to have a normal distribution 
		with mean zero and constant standard deviation.</p>
  <p>So we assume that changing the treatment simply adds or subtracts a constant 
    to the response. And differences between block membership also result in a 
    constant change to the mean response.</p>
  <p class="heading">Three-dimensional scatterplot</p>
  <p>The relationship between the response, blocks and treatments can be displayed 
    in a three-dimensional scatterplot with these three variables on the three 
    axes. This emphasises the similarity in the way that blocks and treatments 
    are modelled.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Codeine and acupuncture for dental pain relief</p>

		
    <p>The diagram below shows the pain relief score for the 32 subjects who were 
      each given one of four treatments (combinations of codeine and acupuncture). 
      They were grouped into blocks of four according to an initial assessment 
      of their pain tolerance and the treatments were randomly allocated to the 
      four subjects in each block. (I.e. a randomised block design was used.)</p>

		<p>The diagram is 3-dimensional. Position the mouse in the middle of the diagram 
			and drag towards the bottom right to rotate the diagram. Rotate a bit until 
			you get a feel for how pain relief depends on both the block and treatment.</p>
		
    <p>Click <strong>Colour different blocks</strong> to join the crosses with 
      coloured lines. This may help to understand the effects of the blocks and 
      treatments on the response.</p>
	
	<ul>
      <li>Click the <strong>y-x</strong> rotation button. Observe that for each 
        block of subjects, differences between the treatments had a similar affect 
        on pain relief.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>y-z</strong> rotation button. Observe that for each 
        treatment, differences between the blocks had a similar affect on pain 
        relief.</li>
    </ul>
