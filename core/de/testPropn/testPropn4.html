<p class="heading">Finding the p-value for a one-tailed test</p>

<p>The LAX weapon-detection hypothesis test involved a random sample of size <i>n</i> from a population with probability π 
of success (detection of weapon). The data collected were <em>x</em> successes, and we tested the hypotheses... </p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span> </p>

  
<p>where π<sub>0</sub> 
was the constant of interest (e.g. 0.96 in this example). The following steps 
were followed to obtain the p-value for the test.</p>

<ol>
<li>The sample proportion of successes, <em>p</em>, 
was identified as the most informative summary statistic about π.</li>
<li>The number of successes, <em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>np</em> 
has a standard binomial distribution with no unknown parameters when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> 
holds, so it is a better test statistic.</li>
<li>The p-value is a sum of tail probabilities for this binomial distribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>The diagram below illustrates these steps</p>

<p class=eqn><object data="images/testProcessA.svg" width="441" height="265" alt="binomial test stat & p-value"></object>
</p>
<p>The telepathy example was similar, but the alternative hypothesis involved 
high values of π 
and the p-value was found by counting upper tail probabilities.</p>
<p class="heading">Finding the p-value for a two-tailed test</p>
  
<p>The appropriate tail probability to use depends on the alternative hypothesis. 
If the alternative hypothesis allows <strong>either high or low</strong> values 
of <em>x</em>, 
the test is called a <strong>two-tailed</strong> test, </p>

<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span> </p>

<p>The p-value is then <strong>double the smaller tail probability</strong> since 
values of <em>x</em> in <strong>both</strong> tails of the binomial distribution would provide evidence 
for <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>. </p>

<p class="heading">Somali blood groups</p>
<p>In a study of sab bondsmen, a population sub-group in Northern Somalia, blood 
tests were conducted on a sample of 54, in order to investigate whether they differed 
genetically from the main population of 'free-born noble Somali'. </p>

<p>It is known that a proportion 0.574 of free-born noble Somali have blood group O.
<font color="#666666">(Actually 574 had blood group O in a sample of 1000, but this
sample size was large enough to provide a reasonably accurate estimate.)</font>
Is there any evidence that the sample proportion with blood group O in
the sab bondsmen, 26 out of 54, does not come from a population with π
&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.574?
This can be expressed as the hypotheses
</p>

<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.574</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 0.574</strong></span></p>

<p>We would expect (0.574 x 54) = 31 of the sab bondsmen to have blood group O.
A sample count that is either much greater than 31 or much less
than 31 would suggest a genetic difference between the sab bondsmen and
the free-born noble Somali. Use the slider below to obtain the p-value.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="420" height="280">

</applet>
</div>

<p>The probability of getting as few as 26 is 0.1084. Since this is a 2-tailed 
test, we must also take account of the probability of getting a count that is 
as unusually high, so the p-value is twice this, 0.2169. Getting 26 sab bondsmen 
with blood group O is therefore not unlikely, so we conclude that there is no 
evidence <strong>from these data</strong> of a genetic difference between sab 
bondsmen and the free-born Somali. </p>
