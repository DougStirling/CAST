<p class=heading>Test statistic</p>
<p>When testing the value of a probability, π, 
the obvious statistic to use from our random sample is the corresponding sample 
proportion, <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>It is however more convenient to use the <strong>number</strong> of successes, 
<em>x</em>, rather than <em>p</em> since we know that <em>X</em> has a <strong>binomial distribution</strong> with 
parameters <em>n</em> (the sample size) and π.</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="50%">
<tr> 
<td align="center" style="color:#000000"><em>X</em> &nbsp; ~ &nbsp; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">binomial</font> (<em>n</em>, π)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>When we know the distribution of the test statistic (at least after the null 
hypothesis has fixed the value of the parameters of interest), it becomes much 
easier to obtain the p-value for the test.</p>

<p class=heading>P-value</p>

<p>As in all other tests, the p-value is the probability of getting such an 'extreme' 
set of data if the null hypothesis is true. Depending on the null and alternative 
hypotheses, the p-value is therefore the probability that <em>X </em>is as big 
(or sometimes as small) as the recorded value.</p>
<p>Since we know the binomial distribution of <em>X</em> when the null hypothesis 
holds, the p-value can therefore be obtained by adding binomial probabilities.</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<td align="center"><strong>The p-value is a sum of binomial probabilities</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Note that the p-value can be obtained exactly <strong>without need for simulations 
or randomisation</strong>.</p>

<p class=heading>Weapon detection at LAX</p>

<p>FAA agents tried to carry 100 weapons onto planes at LA International Airport, 
and 72 of these were detected by security guards. Is this  consistent with the 
national probability of detection, 0.80?</p>

<p class="eqn"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.80</p>
<p class="eqn"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.80</p>

<p>In the diagram below, click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then hold down <strong>Simulate</strong> 
until about 100 samples of 100 values have been generated. The proportion of these 
simulated samples in which 72 or fewer weapons are detected is an approximation 
to the p-value for the test.</p>

<p>Since we know that the number detected has a binomial&nbsp;(100, 0.80) distribution 
when the null hypothesis holds, <font color="#CC0000">the simulation is unnecessary</font>. 
Select<strong> Binomial distribution</strong> from the pop-up menu. This binomial 
distribution is displayed, and the probability of 72 or fewer detected weapons 
is shown to be 0.0342 &mdash; the p-value for the test.</p>
<p>Since the p-value is so small, there would have been very little chance of 
the observed data arising if LAX had probability 0.80 of detection. We can therefore 
conclude that there is strong evidence that the probability of detection is lower 
than this. Note that this can be done <strong>without any simulations</strong>.</p>
