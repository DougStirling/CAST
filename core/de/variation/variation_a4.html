<p class=heading>Surveys</p>

  <p>Some types of data are obtained from experiments such as the tomato-growing experiment on the previous page. In experiments, we actively change some characteristics of each individual &mdash; for example adding fertiliser to half of the tomato plants in the previous page.</p>
  <p>Other types of data are obtained by selecting a sample of individuals in some way and simply recording information about them. This type of data collection is called a <strong>survey</strong> and survey data sets are often so large that it is difficult to get any useful information 
    from the raw data in the data matrix.</p>
  <p class=heading>Summarising data</p>
  <p>To understand survey data, it is common to calculate numerical 
    values that summarise aspects of the data. Such summary values are called <strong>statistics</strong>. </p>
  <center>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white" width="400">
      <tr>
        <th align="CENTER">We will describe several useful summary statistics 
          in <font color="#FF0000">later</font> chapters of CAST.</th>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
  <br>
  <p>An important consequence of the natural variability in data is that summary statistics 
    that are calculated from the data must also be considered as random quantities 
    &mdash; similarly collected data would result in different values for the statistics.</p>
  <center>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white" width="400">
      <tr>
        <th align="CENTER">A major role of statistics is to understand 
          and describe the randomness of such summary statistics.</th>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
  <p>The example below illustrates this variability with a very small survey.</p>

		<p class=heading>Preferences</p>

		<p>Food manufacturers often collect 'preference data' to discover which of 
			several recipes for a type of product is preferred by consumers. Agricultural 
			researchers collect similar data to assess whether consumers like new crop 
			varieties better than existing ones. In the example below, 30 people have 
			each been given samples of maize of three different varieties, <em>A</em>, 
			<em>B</em> and <em>C</em>. Each person reported the variety that was preferred.</p>

		<p>The raw data matrix consists of 30 rows (corresponding to the individuals 
			sampled) and one column (a categorical variable with values <em>A</em>, 
			<em>B</em> or <em>C</em> corresponding to the preference for each individual). 
			This can be summarised by the percentage preferring each of the three varieties 
			of maize.</p>
		<p>Click <strong>Another 30 people</strong> a few times to repeat the data 
			collection with different groups of 30 people. The natural variability of 
			the people implies that the proportion preferring each variety varies. A 
			full analysis of the data should take account of the variability in the 
			proportion preferring variety A.</p>
