<p class="heading">Standard deviation of a sample mean</p>
<p>Earlier in this section, we presented a formula for the
standard deviation of a sample mean,</p>
<p class="eqn"><span style="position: relative; top: 5px;"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" align="bottom" height="16" width="19"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position: relative; top: 12px;"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" align="bottom" height="31" width="26"></span>
</p><p>This formula, with &sigma; replaced by <em>s</em>,
can estimate the standard deviation of the mean from a single random
sample.</p>
<p class="heading">Independent random samples</p>
<p>This formula is only accurate if the sample is collected in
such a way that each successive value is unaffected by other values
that have already been collected. For example, if values are sampled at
random <strong>with replacement</strong> from a
population, any population value has the same chance of being selected
whatever values were previously selected. This is called an <strong>independent</strong>
random sample.</p>
<table class="centred" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr> <td><strong>When
statisticians use the term <em>random sample</em>,
independence is implied unless dependence is otherwise mentioned.</strong></td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p class="heading">Dependent random samples</p>
<p>When the sample values depend on each other, they are said to
be <strong>dependent</strong>.</p>
<p>The worst type of dependency arises through bad sample design.
For convenience or to save money, values are often sampled from
'adjacent' individuals. Since these values tend to be similar, there is
less variability in the sample than in the underlying population
&mdash; the sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>,
underestimates &sigma;.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the mean of such a dependent sample is
more variable than the mean of an independent sample of the same size.
For both reasons,</p>

</div></div>
<p>Always check that a random sample is independently selected
from the whole population before using the formula for the standard
deviation of the sample mean.</p>
<div class="diagram"> <p class="heading">Independent
random sample of incomes</p>
<p>In the following diagram, ten male householders are sampled
from a town in order to estimate the town's average income.</p>
<div class="centred"><applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" height="400" width="550">

<param name="appletName" value="sampDesignProg.ClusterSampleApplet"><param name="vertAxis" value="0 55 0 10">

</div><p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong>
once to see the incomes from an independent random sample of ten males
from the town. The cross on the right shows the sample mean income. A
normal distribution is also shown whose standard deviation was obtained
from the formula above .</p>
<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> about 20 more
times and observe that the sample means have a distribution whose
spread conforms (roughly) to the standard deviations that are obtained
from the individual samples.</p>
<p class="heading">Sampling from one street in the town</p>
<p>Now click <strong>Reset</strong>, drag the slider
to give a correlation of 0.9, and take a single sample. This shows what
might be obtained if a single street was selected from the town and the
ten sampled males were all from this street. (Data collection would be
cheaper.) Note that the sampled incomes are similar since the
individuals come from the same area of the town. The formula therefore
predicts a lower standard deviation for the sample mean than before.</p>
<p>Take about 20 more samples and observe that the sample means
are actually <strong>more</strong> variable than for an
independent random sample. For both reasons, the standard deviation
from the formula badly overestimates the accuracy of a sample mean.</p>
<p><strong>With all 20 samples visible, drag the slider to
observe both effects better.</strong></p>
<div class="boxed"><p style="text-align: left;">The
more dependent the sample, ...</p>
<ul> <li>the greater the actual variability of the sample
means, and</li> <li>the lower the predicted standard
