<p class="heading">Stacking the bars</p>

<p>Bar charts can be effective for comparing categorical distributions in different 
groups and we have seen that clustering the bars in different ways can make comparisons 
easier. An alternative way to reduce the visual separation of the bars that we 
want to compare is to <strong>stack</strong> them within each group.</p>
<p class="heading">Ordinal categorical variables</p>
<p>Stacked bar charts are particularly effective when the categorical variable 
is <strong>ordinal</strong>. An <strong>ordinal categorical variable</strong> 
has categories that are ordered &mdash; each category is 'between' those on either 
side in some sense. If the categories cannot be meaningfully ordered, the variable 
is called a <strong>nominal categorical variable</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, questionnaires often ask respondents to specify their age by ticking 
'Under&nbsp;20', '20&nbsp;to&nbsp;29', '30&nbsp;to&nbsp;39', etc. The recorded 
age is an ordinal categorical variable since each age category is between these 
on either side. On the other hand, the type of personal computer owned by each 
respondent (Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Dell or Other) is a nominal categorical 
variable since the categories are not ordered.</p>
<p>Stacked bar charts would be particularly useful for comparing age distributions, 
but less so for types of computer.</p>

<p class="heading">Customer service rating at bank</p>

<p>A major bank conducts a postal survey to assess customer reactions to the services 
it provides by mailing a questionnaire to a sample of account holders. One question 
asked customers to rate overall bank services on a scale between 1 (Excellent) 
and 5 (Unacceptable). The diagram below shows the distribution of these ratings 
for different age groups.</p>

</div>

		<p>There were different numbers of customers in the different age groups, 
			so select <strong>Propn within Age group</strong> or <strong>Percent within 
			Age group</strong> from the pop-up menu at the top.</p>
<p>Now click the checkbox <strong>Stacked</strong> to change the bar chart into 
a stacked bar chart. Since the responses are ordinal (e.g. <em>Acceptable</em> 
is between <em>Good</em> and <em>Poor</em>), the stacked bar charts are particularly 
effective for comparing the groups. Observe in particular that.</p>

<ul>
<li>The service ratings tend to be better for older customers</li>
<li>The proportion giving a <em>Good</em> rating in the 31-40 age group is high 
-- relatively few of them choose <em>Excellent</em>.</li>
</ul>
