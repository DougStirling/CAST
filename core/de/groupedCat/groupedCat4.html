<p class="heading">Stacking the bars</p>

<p>Bar charts can be effective for comparing categorical distributions in different 
groups and we have seen that clustering the bars in different ways can make comparisons 
easier. An alternative way to reduce the visual separation of the bars that we 
want to compare is to <strong>stack</strong> them within each group.</p>
<p class="heading">Ordinal categorical variables</p>
<p>Stacked bar charts are particularly effective when the categorical variable 
is <strong>ordinal</strong>. An <strong>ordinal categorical variable</strong> 
has categories that are ordered &mdash; each category is 'between' those on either 
side in some sense. If the categories cannot be meaningfully ordered, the variable 
is called a <strong>nominal categorical variable</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, questionnaires often ask respondents to specify their age by ticking 
'Under&nbsp;20', '20&nbsp;to&nbsp;29', '30&nbsp;to&nbsp;39', etc. The recorded 
age is an ordinal categorical variable since each age category is between these 
on either side. On the other hand, the type of personal computer owned by each 
respondent (Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Dell or Other) is a nominal categorical 
variable since the categories are not ordered.</p>
<p>Stacked bar charts would be particularly useful for comparing age distributions, 
but less so for types of computer.</p>

<p class="heading">Body image and race</p>

<p>Does the perception of women about whether they are overweight depend on their ethnic 
group?</p>

<p>Questionnaires were completed by 246 working women in New Zealand with similar 
body-mass index (weight in kg divided by the square of height in metres) &mdash; all 
were a little lighter than average for their height. The respondents were classified 
as Maori (the native population in New Zealand) or of European, Asian or Pacific 
Islands descent. The diagram below shows each woman's rating of her own size (between 
slightly underweight and very overweight).</p>

		<p>There were different numbers in the different ethnic groups, so select 
			<strong>Propn within Ethnic group</strong> or <strong>Percent within Ethnic 
			group</strong> from the pop-up menu at the top.</p>
<p>Now click the checkbox <strong>Stacked</strong> to change the bar chart into 
a stacked bar chart. Since the responses are ordinal (e.g. <em>Right</em> is between 
<em>Bit underweight</em> and <em>Bit overweight</em>), the stacked bar charts 
are particularly effective for comparing the groups. Observe in particular that.</p>

<ul>
<li>A large proportion of the Pacific Islanders consider themselves to be <em>Right</em>.</li>
<li>A large proportion of the Europeans consider themselves to be a bit or moderately 
overweight.</li>
</ul>
