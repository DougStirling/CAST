<p class=heading> What experimental units should be used?</p>

<p>It is desirable for experimental units to be as similar as possible, so every
attempt should be made to make the experimental units homogeneous. We should therefore
characterise the process in terms of 'nuisance' variables and endeavour to find
ways of minimising their variability for the experiment.
</p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Variability is the enemy of the experimenter!</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Often however, the experimenter has little influence on the choice of experimental 
units and must contend with whatever variability exists. If possible, the experimental 
units should be grouped into blocks which can be used later in the design process 
to obtain more precise answers to the questions of interest. </p>

<p class="heading">What response variable should be recorded?</p>

<p>In an experiment, there is sometimes a single obvious response measurement 
from an experimental unit (e.g. number of computers sold, concentration of impurities, 
exam mark), but often there are several variables which can be considered as response 
measurements.</p>
<p>For example, in a study of the effect of an epidural pain killer during birth, 
what do you measure?</p>
<ul>
<li>The mother's rating of pain on a 1-to-10 scale during the birth?</li>
<li>The mother's rating of pain as remembered after the birth?</li>
<li>Physical measurements of the contractions during birth?</li>
<li>Other physical measurements related to pain?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many possibilities here and a physician would need to decide on which 
was most important from a biological perspective.</p>

<p class=heading> Controlled variables</p>

<p>Thought also needs to be given to which variables need to be controlled
(the input variables) and what settings should be used for these variables
in different experimental runs. In an agricultural experiment, do we only want
to assess the difference in yields for three crop varieties, or do we simultaneously
want to determine the effects of different levels of application of fertiliser?
(And if so, what levels should be used?)
