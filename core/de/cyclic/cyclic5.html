<p class="heading">Seasonal patterns</p>
	<p>Many time series change in cycles, with increases and decreases that cannot 
    be explained by a smooth trend line.</p>
	
<p>Some cycles are <strong>seasonal</strong>. For example, hotel occupancy is 
consistently highest every summer, so monthly figures have a pattern that repeats 
each year. Similar annual patterns can be observed in temperatures, unemployment 
rates, airline passengers and many other monthly and weekly time series. Daily 
data can have a similar pattern that repeats each week &mdash; for example, cinema 
attendance peaks on Friday and Saturday. Demand for electricity also has an hourly 
cycle within each day.</p>
	<p>Seasonal patterns are distinguished by a period that repeats exactly &mdash; for 
		example, monthly data has a period of <strong>exactly</strong> 12 months.</p>
    
  <div class="boxed"><p>Seasonal patterns are not usually referred to as 'cyclical'. Seasonal 
patterns will be dealt with in the next section.</p></div>
    
	<p class="heading">Cyclical patterns</p>
  <p>Other cycles do <strong>not</strong> 
    repeat regularly. The period of the cycles may be <strong>fairly</strong> 
    regular, such as sun-spot activity which has a cycle of approximately 11 years. 
    The cycles are not all <strong>exactly</strong> the same length however.</p>
	<p>Many business indicators also vary in cycles, though their periods are usually 
		less regular. The 'business cycle' can be anywhere between 3 and 10 years, 
		making it very difficult to predict.</p>
	<div class="boxed">
	  <p>The AR(1) method can be used to obtain forecasts for cyclical data with irregular cycle lengths.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>We will not distinguish cyclical patterns and other forms of autocorrelation here.</p>
  
	<div class="boxed">
    <p>In the following sections of this chapter, we will use the term <strong>cyclical patterns</strong> to refer to all forms of autocorrelation.</p>
