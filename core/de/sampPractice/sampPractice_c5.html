<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
from some members of the target population.</p>
<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>

<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
only a subgroup of it.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>A researcher is interested in the profitability of wheat growers in a region. 
There is no database containing names and addresses of all farmers growing wheat, 
so questionnaires are sent to members of a local wheat-growers association. Depending 
on the number and characteristics of farmers who grow wheat but are <strong>not</strong> 
members of the association, there is potential for considerable coverage error.

<p>In order to discover attitudes by employees in a large insurance company towards 
the staff cafeteria, a questionnaire is handed to all staff when they enter the 
cafeteria one day. Management uses these results to 'prove' that staff are happy 
with the facilities that they offer.</p>
<p>This survey only covers staff who use the cafeteria, not all staff in the company. 
There is potential for considerable coverage error since staff who do not use 
the cafeteria are more likely to think badly of it. </p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>

<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ...
</p>

<ul>
  
<li>Failure to contact the individuals. In a telephone survey, there will be no 
answer from some numbers. In a door-to-door survey, there may be no one at home.</li>
  <li>Refusal to participate in the study. Some individuals will be too busy or
  will object to the invasion of their privacy.</li>
  <li>Refusal to answer particular questions. For example, people are often unwilling
  to disclose their incomes or information that is of commercial value to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
survey are likely to be biased.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p>A survey is conducted by a market research company to assess whether people 
in a city believe that there are enough nightclubs and bars. Phone numbers are 
randomly selected from a telephone directory and these numbers are phoned in weekday 
evenings. </p>
<p>People who are not at home (and therefore do not respond) are more likely to 
use nightclubs and bars than those who do respond. The sample responding will 
therefore tend to underestimate the proportion who would like more clubs and bars. 
The estimate would therefore be biased. </p>

<p><font color="#666666">There are several other flaws in this survey that
introduce further non-sampling errors. In particular, there is also coverage error
since residents whose numbers are not listed in the telephone directory cannot be
sampled.</font></p>

<p class=heading>Real example</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p>In the 1936 American presidential election, there were
two candidates, Roosevelt and Landon. The <i>Literary Digest</i> conducted a poll,
aiming to predict the result of the election; its procedure was to mail questionnaires
to 10 million Americans (using names from telephone books and club membership).
From the 2.4 million replies, it made the following prediction:
</p>

<center>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
        <caption align="TOP"><strong>Percentage of votes</strong>
</caption>
<tr>
<th align="CENTER"> </th>
<th align="CENTER">Landon</th>
<th align="CENTER">Roosevelt</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Literary Digest's prediction</td>
<td bgcolor=white align="CENTER">57</td>
<td bgcolor=white align="CENTER">43</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Actual result</td>
<td bgcolor=white align="CENTER">38</td>
<td bgcolor=white align="CENTER">62</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Despite the large sample size (and resulting small sampling error), the
non-sampling errors were extremely large in the poll.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only individuals in households with telephones or in clubs were sampled (coverage error).
  <li>Of these, only 24% replied (non-response error).</li>
</ul>

<p>The group who responded would have different
characteristics from the whole population, hence the large difference between the
Literary Digest prediction and the actual election result.
</p>

<p><font color="#666666">Incidentally, another pollster, George Gallup, also conducted
a survey before this election. Although he only sampled 50,000 people, he put
more effort into making his sample representative. His poll predicted that Roosevelt
would win the election with 56 percent of the vote, much closer to the actual result.
