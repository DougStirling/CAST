<p class=heading>'Inaccurate' responses</p>
<p>The next two types of non-sampling error are caused by inaccurate information 
being obtained from the sampled individuals.</p>
<p class=heading>Instrument error</p>

<p><strong>Instrument error</strong> usually results from poorly designed
questions. Different wording of questions can lead to different answers being 
given by a respondent. The wording of the question may be such as to elicit some
particular response (a <strong>leading</strong> question) or it may simply be carelessly
worded so that it is misinterpreted by some respondents.

    <table width="80%" border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="white">
      <tr> 
        <td><em>I am interviewing for the Smiths Confectionary Company. Do you 
          prefer Smiths or Jones chocolate?</em></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        
<td><em>The government intends to improve profitability of manufacturers by removing 
interest rate controls. Do you agree?</em></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td><em>How many workers do you employ in your farm?</em></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p>The first two questions are <strong>leading questions</strong> &mdash; it is clear 
which answer the interviewer is hoping for, and we are tempted to oblige! The 
third question will be clear to many respondents, but others employ seasonal or 
part-time workers and may answer this question in different ways. </p>

<p class=heading>Interviewer error</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer error</strong> occurs when some characteristic of the interviewer, such
as age or sex, affects the way in which respondents answer questions. For example,
questions about racial discrimination might be differently answered depending on the
racial group of the interviewer.

<p>Use the button <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times. Some
respondents who really prefer Jones chocolate have stated that they prefer Smiths.
As a result, the sample proportion preferring Smiths chocolate is higher than
the proportion in the target population.
