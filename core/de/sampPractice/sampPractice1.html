<p class="heading">Grouping of individuals</p>

<p>A simple random sample of individuals from some population is conceptually 
the easiest sampling scheme. However more accurate estimates of population characteristics 
can often be obtained with different sampling schemes.</p>
<p>If the individuals in the population can be split into different groups (called 
<strong>strata</strong> in sampling terminology), it is often better to take a 
simple random sample <strong>within each separate group</strong> than to sample 
randomly from the whole population. This is called a <strong>stratified random 
sample</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, a simple random sample of 40 students from a class of 200 males 
and 200 females might (by chance) include 25 males and 15 females. A stratified 
random sample would randomly select 20 males and 20 females, ensuring that the 
sex-ratio in the sample matched that in the population.</p>
<p>The benefits from stratified random sampling are greatest if the measurement 
being sampled is different in the different strata. For example, we might want 
to estimate the mean summer income of the students. If male students tend to have 
higher incomes than female students, a stratified random sample based on gender 
will be more accurate than a simple random sample.</p>

<p class="heading">Weekly turnover by grocery stores</p>

<p>The diagram below shows the weekly turnover of 100 grocery stores in a city. 
Of these stores, 50 belong to large grocery chains and the other 50 are smaller 
independent stores. The 50 stores belonging to chains tend to have higher turnovers. 
(This is not real data &mdash; the difference between the two types of store is more 
extreme than would usually be observed, but does illustrate the potential gains 
from stratified sampling.)</p>

<p>The left half of the diagram illustrates simple random sampling of 10 from 
the 100 stores, whereas stratified random sampling of 5 store from each group 
is illustrated on the right.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to observe the variability of 
the mean turnover for the two sampling schemes. (A jittered dot plot of the means 
is shown to the right of each samples. A normal curve shows the distribution of 
the sample means.)</p>
<p>Observe that stratified random sampling gives sample means with less variability. 
The mean from a stratified random sample is therefore a more accurate estimate 
of the population mean.</p>

<div class="boxed">
  <p>In practice, the aim is more likely to be estimation of the <strong>total</strong> grocery turnover in the city, but this is simply 100 times the mean turnover, so stratified sampling gives the same improvement over a simple random sample.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class="heading">Groups with different variability (advanced)</p>
<p>In stratified random samples, random samples are usually taken from the different 
strata in proportion to the number of population values in the strata. For example, 
if a population of 1,000 values is split into three strata of <em>N</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;500, 
<em>N</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;300 and <em>N</em><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;200 
values and a sample of <em>n</em> = 50 is to be taken, then samples of <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;25, 
<em>n</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;15 and <em>n</em><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10 
would be taken from the three strata &mdash; i.e. <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> of the 
population within each stratum.</p>

<p>This proportionality is not however essential, and greater accuracy can be 
obtained by selecting larger samples from strata with greater variability. However 
if sample size is not proportional to stratum size, the overall sample mean is 
no longer appropriate for estimating the overall population mean.</p>

<p>If there are <em>k</em> strata of size <em>N</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>N</em><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<em>N<sub>k</sub></em>, 
and samples of size <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;<em>n<sub>k</sub></em> 
are taken from the strata, giving means <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub>1</sub></span>, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub>2</sub></span>, ..., <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"><span class="black"><sub><em>k</em></sub></span> 
, then the population mean should be estimated by</p>

<p class="heading">Weekly turnover by grocery stores</p>

<p>The following diagram is similar to the one above, but in this example, there 
are 80 small stores (with relatively low turnover) and 20 chain stores with higher 
turnover and also a higher spread in their distribution.</p>

<p>The left half of the diagram does stratified random sampling with sample sizes 
proportional to the stratum sizes (8 local stores and 2 chain stores). On the 
right, a disproportionately large sample is taken from the chain stores because 
of their higher variability &mdash; 3 local stores and 7 chain stores.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to verify that the estimated 
mean weekly turnover is more accurate when a larger sample is taken from the chain 
stores &mdash; the variability in the estimate is lower.</p>
</div>

<p>An extreme example of disproportionate sample sizes occurs when using sampling 
to estimate the mean profits of companies. If a list of 'large' companies is available, 
it is often best to record information from <strong>all</strong> of the large 
companies but only sample a small fraction of the smaller companies.</p>
