<p class="heading">Chartjunk</p>
  
<p>As with bar charts, pie charts are often graphical representations of a small 
number of values. For example, a pie chart of the gender of students in a class 
is only based on a single value, the proportion of males. As a result, there is 
a temptation to 'enhance' pie charts as 3-dimensional objects &mdash; chartjunk.</p>
<p>Resist the temptation &mdash; it does not make the data any easier to understand 
and may indeed be misleading since 3-dimensional pie charts can over-emphasise 
the categories closest to the viewer.</p>

<p class="heading">Hospital workforce in Australia</p>

<p>Health administrators need to understand the composition of their workforce. 
The 3-dimensional pie chart below shows the occupations of employees in Australian 
hospitals in 1996.</p>
<div class="centred"><object data="images/hospital3DPie.svg" width="474" height="204"></object>
</div>
<p>The viewpoint tends to make the closest categories appear too large. In particular, 
there seem to be as many <em>Aides (nurse and therapy)</em> as <em>Doctors</em>. 
(There were only 4.6 percent <em>Aides</em> but 6.7 percent <em>Doctors</em>.)</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Small is beautiful</p>

<p>In general, it is better to draw a standard pie chart smaller rather than embellishing 
it with chartjunk.</p>

<p class="heading">Extra holidays?</p>

<p>A moderately large company with 426 employees, half of which are hourly paid, 
is considering organisational changes. Before implementing any new policies, all 
employees are given a questionnaire to assess their attitudes to various possible 
changes to the work environment.</p>
<p>Among the changes under consideration is an option for employees to take an 
extra day of vacation without pay each month. The 'exploded' pie chart below describes 
the responses to this idea.</p>

<p>The simpler small pie chart below shows the data more clearly. </p>
