<p class="heading">Chartjunk</p>

<p><object data="images/simpleBarchart.svg" width="162" height="147" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></object>If 
a categorical data set has only a few distinct categories, the information in 
it can be very simply expressed. For example, consider the gender of each student 
in a class of 160. The bar chart on the right only shows that there were 100 males, 
62.5% of the class.</p>
<p>Since the information contained in a bar chart is often simple (only 2 values 
above), it is tempting to embellish bar charts 'artistically' to make them more 
visually appealing. These additions are collectively called <strong>chartjunk</strong>. 
Many spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel, make it easy to add chartjunk to bar 
charts.</p>
<p>In general, chartjunk should be avoided &mdash; it is usually easier to read information 
from a standard bar chart. Rather than adding chartjunk, draw the bar chart small 
or  replace it with a frequency table.</p>

<p class="heading">Three-dimensional chartjunk</p>
<p>A common form of chartjunk is obtained by changing each bar into a 3-dimensional 
object. When the resulting 3-dimensional picture is rotated, it often becomes 
harder to compare the heights of bars and to read off values from the axes. In 
particular, perspective views should be avoided.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Hawaii visitor arrivals in 2001</p>

<p>The diagram below was produced by Microsoft Excel to show the origin of all 
visitors to Hawaii in 2001.</p>

<div class="centred"><object data="images/hawaii3DBars.svg" width="454" height="328"></object>
</div>
<p>Although this display is more visually appealing than the original barchart, 
it is now harder to assess whether the visitor numbers from Japan were just over 
or under 1.5 million.</p>
<p>Although the above barchart is still acceptable, the extra rotation and perspective 
viewpoint of the diagram below make it an extremely poor representation of the 
data. </p>
<div class="centred"><object data="images/hawaiiPerspBars.svg" width="374" height="376"></object>
</div>
<table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Avoid drawing bar charts in 3-dimensions.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p class="heading">Replacing bars with objects</p>

<p>A second type of chartjunk is obtained by replacing the rectangular bars in 
a barchart with pictures of objects. This a much more serious problem since it 
often visually mis-represents the proportions in the different categories. Are 
the frequencies proportional to the heights of the objects, their areas on the 
paper or their 3-dimensional volumes? At a quick glance, most readers would use 
something between area and volume though it is usually the heights of the bars 
that actually determine the size of the objects in this type of diagram.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Merit raises</p>

<p>As part of a study of how merit pay policies are tied to employee performance, 
data were collected about the merit raises (measured as a percentage of salary) 
for 3,990 employees in a large company. The diagram below was published to summarise 
the data.</p>
<div class="centred"><object data="images/carrotBarChart.svg" width="439" height="324"></object>
</div>
<p>The use of carrots for the bars is very misleading since doubling the height 
(corresponding to double the frequency) corresponds to <strong>four times the 
area</strong> of the carrot and <strong>eight times its volume</strong>.</p>
    <p>In particular, the employees getting under 5% merit increase seem visually 
      unimportant, but they comprise nearly 10% of the total employees.</p>
    <table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
      <tr> 
        <td><strong>Using pictures of objects instead of bars in a barchart is 
          misleading and must be avoided.</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><font color="#666666">(The merit increases above are really continuous 
      numerical values and a histogram would have been a more appropriate display. 
      However numerical data are occasionally grouped and treated as categorical 
      for analysis.)</font></p>
