<p class="heading">How much data do I need to collect?</p>

<p>In the previous page, we investigated how to determine the sample size needed 
to estimate a population mean to a specified accuracy. A similar calculation can 
be used to find the size of sample required for estimating a probability.</p>
<p>A 95% confidence interval for a probability π 
is of the form</p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/estPropn/images/ciP.gif" width="141" height="46"> </p>
<p>If we want our estimate to be within <em>k</em> of π 
with probability 0.95, then we need <em>n</em> to be large enough that</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/ciExtra/images/propInequality.gif" width="138" height="43"> </p>

<p>In order to use this inequality, we need a guess at the value of <em>p</em> &mdash; it does not need to be particularly accurate.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<th align="CENTER">A small pilot survey is often conducted to obtain a preliminary 
estimate for the proportion.</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>If we can do no better, the 'worst-case' value, <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5 
can be used, but the resulting sample size may be higher than needed. </p>
<p>The necessary sample size can be found by trial-and-error in the above inequality.</p>

<p class="heading">Survival from lung cancer</p>

<p>Health researchers want to estimate the proportion of lung cancer patients 
that survive five years after diagnosis.</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<th align="CENTER">How many patient records must be examined to be at least 95% confident that 
the resulting estimate will be within 2% of the true population proportion?</th>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>The following diagram helps with the calculations.</p>

<div class="centred">

<p>We have not been given a guess at the value of π, 
so drag the slider to 0.5 &mdash; the worst-case scenario. <font color="#666666">(Use 
the arrow keys on your keyboard for fine adjustment of π.)</font></p>
<p>Drag the sample size slider until the '±' value is less than 0.02. Verify 
that the sample size should be about 2,500 or higher.</p>
<hr align="center" width="75%">
<p>It was reported in the May 1990 issue of <em>Good Housekeeping</em> that only 
about 14% of lung cancer patients surive for five years after diagnosis, and we 
may feel that it is safe to assume that the current survival is no higher than 
20%. Use the slider to change the guess of π 
to 0.20 in the diagram above and verify that a sample size of about 1,600 would 
be enough to estimate π 
to within 0.02 with 95% confidence.</p>

<p>Trial-and-error can be avoided with a little algebra. The equation</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/ciExtra/images/propInequality.gif" width="138" height="43"> </p>
