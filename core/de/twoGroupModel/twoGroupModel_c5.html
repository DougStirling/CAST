<p class="heading">Comparing the populations</p>

<p>For two-group data sets, we usually want to compare the underlying populations. 
In particular, the main questions of interest are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the two population distributions the same?</li>
<li>If the populations are different, how big is the difference?</li>
</ul>
<p class="heading">Comparing the population means</p>

  
<p>The two standard deviations in the groups may differ. However we are usually 
more interested in differences between the population means. The earlier questions 
can be asked in terms of the difference between these means,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black">&delta; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &mu;<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;&minus;&nbsp; &mu;<sub>1</sub></span></p>
<p>If the group means are equal (and µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> is therefore zero), then values from neither group are higher than from the other, 
on average. Indeed, if the distributions are normal and σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub> are also equal, then a zero value for µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> also implies that the distributions in the two groups are identical. </p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> 
describes how much higher the values in group 2 are (on average) than the values 
in group 1.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The best estimate of µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> is, naturally, the difference between the means of the two samples, <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>.</p>
<p class="heading">Randomness of sample difference</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span> 
cannot give a definitive answer to questions about µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> since it is a random summary statistic &mdash; it varies from sample to sample. The 
distribution of <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span> 
must be understood before we can make any inference about µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p class="heading">Simulation: Manipulative skills of job applicants</p>
<p>To test the manipulative skill of job applicants, they are sometimes given 
a 'one-hole test' in which they grasp a pin, move it to a hole, insert it, and 
return for another pin. The test score is the number of pins inserted in a fixed 
time interval. A large study was undertaken comparing male college students with 
experienced female industrial workers. The table below describes the number of 
pins inserted in one minute.</p>

<table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr> 
<th>Group</th>
<th>n</th>
<th>mean</th>
<th>s</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Male college students</td>
<td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;750&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Experienced female industrial workers</td>
<td align="center">412</td>
<td align="center">37.32</td>
<td align="center">3.83</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We will conduct a simulated experiment based on this scenario. In the simulation, 
we will generate 'numbers of pins' for <strong>40</strong> male students from 
a normal distribution with µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= 35.12&nbsp; 
pins and σ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.31 
pins and similar data for another <strong>40</strong> experienced female workers 
from a normal distribution with µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;37.32 
and σ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.83.</p>
<p>Note that the female industrial workers, on average, insert µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.20 
more pins than the male students.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong>, then take several samples. Observe that 
the difference between the sample means is a random quantity whose distribution 
is centred on µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.20 
pins .</p>
<p>The difference in means from a single data set, <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>, 
is therefore an <strong>estimate</strong> of µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub>, 
but is unlikely to be exactly equal to it.</p>

<p class="heading">Welders who are paid a salary and those on piecework</p>

<p>In practice, the underlying population means (and their difference) are unknown, 
and only a single sample from each group is available. The data set below is a 
typical example.</p>

<p class="eqn"><object data="images/piecework2.svg" width="523" height="296"></object></p>

<p>Without an understanding of the distribution of <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>, 
it is impossible to properly interpret what the sample difference, 9.5 pieces, 
tells you about the difference between the underlying population means.</p>
