<p class=heading>Simulation and randomisation</p>
<p>Simulation and randomisation are closely related techniques. Both are based 
on assumptions about the model underlying the data and involve randomly generated 
data sets.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Simulation</dt>
<dd>New data sets are generated directly from the model.</dd>
<dt>Randomisation</dt>
<dd>Modifications to the actual data are identified that would have the same probability 
of arising if the model held. New data sets are randomly picked from these</dd>
</dl>

<p>Randomisation is understood most easily through an example.</p>
<p class=heading>Comparing two groups</p>
<p>If random samples are taken from two populations, we are often interested in 
whether the populations have the same means.</p>
<p>If the two populations were identical, any allocation of the sample values 
to the two groups would have been as likely as the observed sample data. By observing 
the distribution of the difference in means from such randomised allocations of 
values to groups, we can get an idea of whether the actual difference in sample 
means is unusually large.</p>
<p>An example helps to explain this method.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>Characteristics of failed companies</p>

<p>A study in Greece compared characteristics of 68 healthy companies with those 
of another 33 that had recently failed. The jittered dot plots on the left below 
show the ratio of current assets to current liabilities for each of the 101 companies.</p>
<p>The mean asset-to-liabilities ratio for the sample of failed companies is 0.902 
lower than that for the healthy companies, but the distributions overlap. Might 
this difference be simply a result of randomness, or can we conclude that there 
is a difference in the underlying populations?</p>

<p>Click <strong>Randomise</strong> to randomly pick 33 of the the 101 values 
for the failed group. If the underlying distribution of asset-to-liabilities ratios 
was the same for healthy and failed companies, each such randomised allocation 
would be as likely as the observed data.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> and repeat the randomisation several more 
times. Observe that the difference in means would rarely be as far from zero as 
-0.902 when we assume the same distribution for both groups. This strongly suggests 
that the distributions must be different.</p>
<p>Since the actual difference is so unusually large,&nbsp;...</p>
