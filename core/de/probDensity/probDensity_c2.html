<p class="heading">Probability and population proportion</p>

<p>When sampling from a <strong>finite</strong> population, the probability of any 'event' is the proportion of population values for which that 'event' happens. For example, the probability that a randomly selected household from a town contains more than two adults equals the proportion of households of that size in the town.</p>
<p>The same definition can be used for <strong>infinite</strong> populations, even if the population is abstract. When selecting one value from the population,</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>The probability of any value or range of values equals the <strong>proportion of these values in the population</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p class="heading">Probability and long-term proportion</p>
<p>There is an alternative but equivalent way to think about probability when it is possible to imagine repeatedly selecting more and more values from the population (e.g. repeating an experiment again and again).</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>The probability of any value or range of values is the <strong>limiting proportion of these values as the sample size increases</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>The fact that the sample proportion always stabilises at the probability (i.e. the population proportion) is called the <strong>law of large numbers</strong>.</p>

<p class="heading">Medical insurance claims</p>

<p>We will consider whether a claim is made on a medical insurance policy in one 
year. The result is a categorical value (claim or no claim), but is not sampled 
from any real population. However we still describe the randomness of the birth 
with the <strong>probability</strong> of there is a claim on the policy.</p>
<p> Alternatively, we may imagine a hypothetical infinite population of policies 
in which there is some proportion with claims and the rest have no claims. The 
proportion with claims in this hypothetical population is the probability that 
any individual policy will have a claim in the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will consider whether a claim is made on a medical insurance policy in one 
year. The result is a categorical value (<em>claim</em> or <em>no claim</em>). The randomness of whether there is a claim on one policy can be modelled as being a value that is randomly sampled from an abstract infinite population in which a proportion of values are <em>claim</em> and the rest are <em>no claim</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>probability</strong> that one policy will result in a claim is the proportion of <em>claim</em> values in this underlying population.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can imagine examining more and more similar insurance policies. The probability of one policy resulting in a claim is also the limiting proportion of claims in this (imaginary) sequence of policies.</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>These are two different ways to think about the probability, but the value is the same.</p>
</div>
<p class="heading">Law of large numbers</p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the fact that a sample proportion tends to a limit as the sample size increases. (The limit is the probability.) Imagine recording the whether each of a sequence of medical insurance policies 
has a claim during one year.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Find new value</strong> a few times to observe a sequence of 
policies. When only one policy has been observed, the proportion with claims must 
be either 0 or 1, but after 20 have been observed, the proportion should be somewhere 
near <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>Continue observing additional policies until about 1000 have been recorded. 
By this time, the proportion of claims will have stabilised.</p>
<p><font color="#666666">(Hold down the button <strong>Find 10 values</strong> 
to speed up the simulation.)</font></p>
<p>If we carried on infinitely long, the proportion would stabilise at a value 
that we call the <strong>probability</strong> of there being a claim on a policy.</p>
