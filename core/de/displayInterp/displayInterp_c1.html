<p class=heading>Outliers and incorrect measurements</p>

<p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data are 
called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>

  <p>Detection of outliers is particularly important. An outlier may have been 
    incorrectly recorded, or there may have been other anomalous circumstances 
    associated with it. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything 
    atypical can be found, outliers should be deleted from the data set and their deletion noted in any reports about the data. </p>

		<p class="heading">FTSE 100 Share Price Changes</p>
		<p>Share price changes are monitored carefully by investment managers. The

	  <p>The stacked dot plot shows one outlier. The share price of Mmo2, a major 
			British mobile phone operator, dropped by over 11 percent during that day. 
			A financial analyst would look carefully at this company to find what caused 
			this drop.</p>
		<p>Drag over the other crosses to identify the corresponding company names. 
			Do you see anything in common between the companies whose share prices dropped 
			sharply? Three out of the next four companies that performed poorly are 
			also major players in the telecommunications area (Vodafone, Cable &amp; 
			Wireless and British Telecom). However the performance of Mmo2 is still 
			extreme enough for it to be classified as an outlier.</p>

  <p class="heading">Outliers and skew distributions</p>

  <p>An extreme data value that stands out from the rest of the data does not necessarily 
    indicate that there is a mistake in the data or something unusual about the 
    individual. Our interpretation of the extreme value should also take into 
    account the shape of the distribution of values for the rest of the data.</p>
	<dl>
    <dt>Symmetric distribution</dt>
  </dl>
  <p class=eqn><object data="images/outlierSymmetric.svg" width="443" height="156" alt="sigmaP-hat = ..."> </object>
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Skew distribution</dt>
    <dd>If the distribution of values has its peak at one side and a long tail 
      to the other side, the distribution is called <strong>skew</strong>. It 
      is not unusual for the extreme value in a very skew distribution to be a 
      fair distance from the other values.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p class=eqn><object data="images/outlierSkew.svg" width="443" height="156" alt="sigmaP-hat = ..."> </object>
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dd>If the tail is to the right we call this a right of positively skewed distribution. Similarly, if the tail is to the left the distribution is left (or negatively) skewed.</dd>
  </dl>

  <div class="diagram">
		<p class="heading">Storm duration</p>

		<p>The stem and leaf plot below shows the durations (in minutes) of the first 
			50 storms in the 1983/4 rainy season in the Bvumbwe catchment in Malawi.</p>
		<p class=eqn><object data="images/stormDurationStemLeaf.svg" width="255" height="260" alt="sigmaP-hat = ..."> </object>
		</p>
		<p>One storm lasted much longer than the others (880 minutes). It is certainly 
			worth checking the records for this storm (was the duration perhaps really 
			88 minutes?). However the value is not necessarily a mistake.</p>
		<p>Most storms are short, with durations less than 100 minutes, so the longest 
			rows of leaves are at the bottom of the stem and leaf plot. There are fewer 
			storms lasting 100-200 minutes, fewer still of 200-300 minutes and this 
			pattern continues, with the frequency of storms decreasing steadily up the 
			stem and leaf plot. This shape of distribution is called a <strong>skew</strong> 
			distribution, as opposed to a <strong>symmetric</strong> distribution whose 
			tails decrease at similar speed on both sides of the peak density.</p>
