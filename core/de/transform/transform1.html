<p class="heading">General idea of transformations</p>
	
<p>Sometimes it is convenient to express numbers on a different scale. For example, 
an American would easily recognise that an air temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit 
is hot, whereas in other countries temperatures are more easily 'understood' on 
the Celsius scale. This is called <strong>transformation</strong>.</p>
	<p>Some transformations are performed for the convenience of the reader (such 
		as the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion above), but transformation can also 
		be a useful tool that can help us understand a data set.</p>
	<p class="heading">Linear transformations</p>
	<p>Sometimes the values in a data set can be replaced by others holding exactly 
		the same information. For example, a taxi operator might record the distances 
		in kilometres travelled by each of the company's 30 taxis on a particular 
		day. If the distances had been recorded in miles, the data set would have 
		contained equivalent information. </p>
	<p>When the new values are found from the original data by
an equation of the form
</p>

  <p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>new value</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>a</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em> &nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>old value</strong></p>

<p>it is called a <strong>linear transformation</strong> of the original values. 
    A linear transformation can change the centre and spread of the data, but 
    its shape otherwise remains unchanged. For graphical displays, only the numbers 
    labelling the axis changes. </p>
		
	<table width="75%" border="1" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    <tr>
		  <td align="center"><strong>Linear transformation changes the centre and 
				spread, but not the shape of a distribution.</strong></td>
	</tr>
</table>

  <p>Since the shape of the distribution is unaffected, linear transformations 
		do not help you to understand the distribution of values in the data.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Distances travelled by taxis</p>
<p>A taxi operator records the distances in kilometres travelled by each of the 
company's 30 taxis on a particular day. Distances in kilometres and miles are 
related by the equation</p>
		<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>miles</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp;0.6214&nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>kilometers</strong></p>
		<p>The dot plot below shows the distances travelled by each taxi in a taxi company during
a single day. The two axes allow the distances to be read off in kilometers and miles
-- separate dot plots are not necessary.

  <p class="heading">Centre and spread</p>
	<p>The centre and spread of linearly transformed data can be easily found from 
		those of the original measurements. After a transformation of the form</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>new value</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>a</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em> &nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>old value</strong></p>
<p>the mean (and other measures of centre such as the median) are similarly 
		related</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>new mean</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>a</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em> &nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>old mean</strong></p>
<p>The standard deviation (and other measures of spread that are expressed in 
		the same units as the raw data, such as the inter-quartile range) are related 
		with the equation.</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>new sd</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp;<em><font size="+1">|</font>b<font size="+1">|</font></em> &nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>old sd</strong></p>
	<p>Note that if the scale factor, b, is negative, we must change its sign since 
		the standard deviation must be positive.</p>
