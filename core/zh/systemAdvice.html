	<p>The interactive diagrams in CAST are Java programs. Since Java cannot be
	used on Android or Apple tablets, the interactive versions of CAST pages are
	therefore not available to you.</p>
	
	<p class="onlyApplets">Although you will be able to
	see the pages in this e-book, their interactive diagrams will be blank. Since
	CAST has been structured to explain statistical concepts using its interactive
	diagrams, you will not find it easy to read.

	<p class="nonApplets">Since this e-book has video
	or summary versions of its pages, you will be able to read them, but the interactive
	versions of the pages will not be available.</p>
	
	<p>Since the interactive versions of the CAST pages are such an important part
	of the e-book, we recommend that it is studied on a full computer (laptop or
	desktop) rather than a tablet or smartphone.</p>
