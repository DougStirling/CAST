<p class=heading>Superimposing histograms</p>
	<p>To compare the distributions in two groups of values (e.g. measurements for males and females), histograms for the two groups can be superimposed on the same axes.</p>
	<p>Colour or shading should be used to help distinguish 
	  the two histograms &mdash; in ordinary black-and-white histograms it can 
	  be difficult to tell which lines belong to which histograms.</p>
	<p class=heading>Relative frequencies to compare two groups</p>
	<p>If the number of values in the two groups differ, when two standard histograms are drawn against a common frequency axis, one histogram can be much smaller than the other. This makes the two distributions much harder to compare.</p>
	<p>The solution is to 
	  make each rectangle height equal to the <strong>proportion</strong> in that 
	  class instead of the class frequency. These proportions are also called the <strong>relative frequencies</strong> in the classes.</p>
	<div class="boxed">
    <p>Use relative frequency histograms to compare groups.</p>
  </div>
	<p>An individual relative frequency histogram has the same shape as the corresponding frequency 
	  histogram &mdash; each bar height is simply divided by the total number of observations 
	  which rescales the histogram height. However using relative frequencies allows 
	  us to make more meaningful comparisons between the distributions of different 
	  groups.</p>

	<p class=heading>Weights of newborn calves</p>

		<p>As part of a study of newborn calves at the author's university, a researcher 
      recorded their birth weights. The calves were of two breeds, <em>Friesian</em> 
      and <em>Angus</em>.</p>

		<p>The area of the histogram of <em>Friesian</em> calf weights is about three 
      times that for the <em>Angus</em> calves (since there were about three times 
      the number of <em>Friesian</em> calves in the study) and this makes comparisons 
      a little harder.</p>
		<p>Select <strong>Relative frequency</strong> from the pop-up menu to scale 
      both histograms to have the same area.</p>
		<p>It is easier to compare the relative frequency histograms. For example, 
      we can now determine visually that a higher proportion of <em>Angus</em> 
      calves have weights between 34 and 40 kg than the corresponding proportion 
      of <em>Friesian</em> calves.</p>

	<p class=heading>Population pyramids</p>
	<p>When two groups are to be compared, an alternative to superimposition is 
		to draw their two histograms back-to-back (in a similar way to back-to-back 
		stem and leaf plots). </p>
	<p>When used to compare age distributions of males and females in a population, 
		these back-to-back histograms are called <strong>population pyramids</strong> 
		-- a common tool in demography. </p>
	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p>The population pyramids below show the age distributions of New Zealanders 
			of European and Maori descent in 1989.</p>
		<div class="centred"><object data="images/popnPyramids.svg" width="673" height="330"></object></div>
		<p>Since the two ethnic groups are of different sizes, relative frequency 
			(in the form of a percentage) is used rather than frequency, permitting 
			easier comparison of the groups. Note that...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Maori population pyramid has a wider base than that of the Europeans, 
        indicating high birth rates and a relatively youthful population.</li>
      <li>In the population pyramid for those of European descent, a bigger proportion of females than males is older than 65.</li>
    </ul>
