<p class="heading">Stability of the shape of box plots</p>

  <p>We saw earlier that features in dot plots, stem and leaf plots and histograms 
		are relatively unstable when used with small data sets. There is high sample-to-sample 
		variability if different data are collected from the same process. Care must 
		therefore be taken not to over-interpret their shape. </p>
	<p>The same happens with box plots, but to a lesser extent. Box plots summarise 
		the data further and are therefore more stable descriptions of the distribution 
		of values than those that we described earlier.</p>
	<p>As with other displays, the larger the data set, the more stable the box 
    plots become.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Diameters of plastic components</p>
<p>The box plot below describes the diameters (mm) of 20 plastic components that 
have been sampled from a production line. </p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="450" height="170">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="boxPlotProg.RandomBoxDotApplet">
<param name="varName" value="diameter">
<param name="random" value="20 8.4 0.045 329473 2.0">
<param name="horizAxis" value="8.3 8.5 8.30 0.05">
<param name="sampleSize" value="20 50 150">
</applet>
</div>

		<p>Click the button <strong>Another sample</strong> several times to see the box plots 
			that might arise from different samples of 20 components from the same production 
			line. Observe that there is considerable variability in the box plots, especially 
			in the extremes, but there are fewer distracting artifacts such as clusters 
			than in the corresponding dot plots. </p>

<p>Use the pop-up menu to change the sample size from 20 to 50, then repeat the sampling
a few times. The box plots become less variable.
</p>

    <p>Finally, repeat with a sample size of 150. The box plot now gives a fairly 
      consistent display, showing clearly that the middle half of the data (between 
      the upper and lower quartiles) is approximately between the values 8.37 
      and 8.43. </p>
