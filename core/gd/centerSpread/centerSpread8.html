<p class="heading">The shape of a distribution</p>
  <p>Many different distributions have the same mean and standard deviation.</p>
	<table width="75%" border="1" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
		<tr> 
			<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><strong>The mean and standard deviation hold <font color="#FF0000">no 
				information about the shape</font> of a distribution, other than its centre 
				and spread.</strong></td>

	</table>
	<p>In particular, the mean and standard deviation give no indication about whether 
		a data set contains:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>two or more clusters</li>
		<li>an outlier</li>
		<li>a skew distribution with a long tail to one side</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These are important features of a data set and should influence the analysis 
		that you perform and the conclusions that you reach. In particular, if you 
		ignore outliers or clusters, you could easily reach the wrong conclusions.</p>

		<p>The following four data sets all contain the same number of values, <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100, 
			and have the same mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;=&nbsp;248.5, 
			and standard deviation, <em>s</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;91.1, but should be analysed 
			in different ways.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Symmetric bell-shaped distribution</dt>
		</dl>

		<dl>
			<dd>
				<p class=eqn><object data="images/anscombe1.svg" width="399" height="131"></object> 
				</p>
				The data set above has a distribution whose shape is what would be imagined 
				from the mean and standard deviation. Its shape is well described by these 
				two summary statistics.</dd>
			<dt>Outlier</dt>
		</dl>

		<dl>
			<dd>
				<p class=eqn><object data="images/anscombe2.svg" width="398" height="171"></object> 
				</p>
				This data set contains an outlier. It is probably a measurement or recording 
				error or the 'individual' is in some other way different from the rest 
				of the data and should not be analysed with them.</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dd>After deleting the outlier, the mean reduces from 248.5 to 241.4 and 
				the standard deviation drops from 91.1 to 57.6. The measurements are therefore 
				much less variable than the raw standard deviation suggests.</dd>
			<dt>Clusters</dt>
		</dl>

		<dl>
			<dd>
				<p class=eqn><object data="images/anscombe3.svg" width="398" height="163"></object>
				</p>
				In this data set, the values separate into two distinct clusters. The 
				researcher should investigate what is different about the 'individuals' 
				in the two clusters. For example, annual rainfalls may have been recorded 
				in two types of years (e.g. La Nina and El Nino), or two different varieties 
				of maize may have been grown in a survey of crop yields.</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dd>The two clusters have different means and the standard deviation <strong>within</strong> 
				each cluster is much smaller than 91.1, so again, the overall mean and 
				standard deviation do not adequately describe the data.</dd>
			<dt>Skew distribution</dt>

				This data set is skew with a long tail towards the high values. The 70-95-100 
				rule suggests that about 15% of values are below <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>s</em> 
				and 15% above <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>s</em> 
				(and 70% between these values), but this distribution has <strong>no</strong> 
				values lower than <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;-&nbsp;s, 
				but 14% are above <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>s</em>, 
				6% are above <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;+&nbsp;2<em>s</em> 
				and 2% are above <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;+&nbsp;3<em>s</em>.</dd>
		</dl>

		<dl>
			<dd>The 70-95-100 rule does not give a good impression of this distribution 
				-- the percentages are only approximately correct for fairly symmetric, 
				bell-shaped distributions.</dd>

		<p>The diagram below shows the four distributions together as histograms to
