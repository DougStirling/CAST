<p class=heading>Are the median and mean the same?</p>

  <p>Although both describe aspects of the 'centre' of a distribution, they are 
		not the same and can occasionally have very different values. This page describes 
		some differences between the interpretation and properties of the median and 
		mean. </p>
	<p class=heading>Social vs economic indicator</p>
	<p>For some data sets, <strong>the median can be considered to be a social indicator,
whereas the mean can be interpreted as an economic indicator</strong>. For example,
if a batch of values consists of the salaries of all employees in a company,
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the median salary indicates what the 'average employee' earns
  (half of the employees earn more and half earn less)</li>
  <li>the mean salary reflects the total amount paid as salaries in the company
  (since it is the total of the salaries, divided by the number of employees)</li>
</ul>

<p class=heading>Outliers</p>

<p>An outlier has little effect on the numerical value of the median,
whereas an outlier affects the mean more strongly. The median is
therefore called a more <strong>robust</strong> measure of centre than the mean.
</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The distribution of values in the data set below is fairly symmetric, so
the mean and median are similar.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="450" height="170">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="statistic2Prog.DragValueApplet">
<param name="dragMessages" value="Drag biggest cross to make an outlier* *">
<param name="varName" value="test">
<param name="values" value="1.0 1.7 1.6 1.9 2.3 2.5 2.8 2.9 3.4 3.9">
<param name="horizAxis" value="0.8 8.2 1 1">
<param name="decimals" value="3">
</applet>
</div>

		<p><strong>Drag</strong> the cross for one of the larger values with the mouse 
			towards the right of the axis (approx 8.0) and observe the effect on the 
			mean and median. </p>

<p>You should observe that the median remains unchanged at 2.4, but the mean
increases considerably. If
this change had been caused by incorrect recording of the value, the resulting outlier would
therefore have badly effected the mean, but not the median.
</p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Skew distributions</p>

<p>When the distribution of a batch of values is fairly symmetrical, the mean and median
are similar. However if the distribution is skew, then the mean is usually further into the
tail of the distribution than the median.
</p>

  <p>This can be readily understood in relation to the balance interpretation 
		of the mean &mdash; values far from the 'centre' have relatively high leverage, 
		so the point of balance (the mean) is further into the tail of the distribution.

<p class="heading">Guinea pig survival</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the number of days that 72 guinea pigs survived after being injected with tubercle bacilli.</p>

</div>

<p>Since the data have a long tail of high survival times, the mean is further into the tail (i.e. larger) than the median.</p>


<p class="heading">Sunshine hours in Gaborone</p>

<p>In a study of the viability of solar cookers in Botswana, sunshine data 
  from the years 1978 to 1997 were analysed. The following jittered dot plot 
  shows the total sunshine hours on 25th February each year from 1978 to 1997.</p>
  
<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="450" height="150">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="statistic2Prog.DragValueApplet">
<param name="varName" value="Sunshine hours">
<param name="values" value="9.6 11.5 5.7 11.2 11.5 11.3 9.6 4.9 11.2 11.3 10.4 7.8 10.5 11.9 11.7 8.5 10.9 10.6 9.1 11.8">
<param name="horizAxis" value="4 13 4 2">
<param name="decimals" value="2">
<param name="allowDrag" value="false">
<param name="showVarName" value="true">
</applet>
</div>

<p>In this data set, the data have a skew distribution with a long tail to the <strong>left</strong> so the mean 
  daily hours of sunshine is much less than the median (but again further into the long 
  tail of the distribution).</p>
