<p class="heading">'Quarter-range' rule of thumb</p>
	<p>Unfortunately the definition of the standard deviation is rather complex 
		and this makes its value difficult to interpret. The best we can do is to 
		give some guidelines. For many data sets, the standard deviation is just under 
		a quarter of the range.</p>
	<center>
		<table border="0" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0">
			<tr> 
				<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><object data="images/deviations2.svg" width="454" height="158"></object></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</center>
	<p>This is a simple rule, but is only very approximate. The standard deviation 
		can be more than a quarter the range in distributions with short tails or 
		much less if there are long tails or outliers.</p>
	<p>The following rule of thumb works for more data sets.</p>
	<p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb</p>
	<p>A more accurate rule-of-thumb that helps you to interpret the standard deviation 
		is called the <strong>70-95-100 rule</strong>. In many distributions, </p>
	<ul>
  <li>Approximately 70% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
  <li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
  <li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
</ul>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule holds approximately for most reasonably symmetric data 
		sets. </p>
	<table width="75%" border="1" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
		<tr> 
			<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><strong>For skew data, or data sets with long tails, 
				outliers or clusters the 70-95-100 rule is often less accurate.</strong></td>
		</tr>

		<p>After checking the 70-95-100 rule of thumb for this data set, use the pop-up menu to check how well it works for a few other data sets with reasonably symmetric distributions.</p>
		<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb helps to understand and explain what the value 
			of the standard deviation tells you about the spread of distributions that 
			are reasonably symmetric and bell-shaped. However if the distribution is 
			highly skew, the mean and standard deviation only give a partial description 
			of the shape of the distribution.</p>
		<p class=heading>Hours of sunshine in Gaborone</p>
		<p> As part of a study about the use of solar cookers, the number of hours 
		  of sunshine (a value between 0 and 6) was recorded in Gaborone each February 
		  morning between 1978 and 1997. The stacked dot plot below shows these 554 
		  values and is highly skew. The mean and standard deviation on their own give no indication of the skewness in the 
		data and are therefore a very incomplete description of the distribution.</p>
		
<p class=eqn><object data="images/sunshineHours.svg" width="399" height="322"></object></p>
		
		<p>The standard deviation does still summarises the spread of values. However considerably more than 70% of the values are within 1<em>s</em> of 
			the mean and none are more than 1<em>s</em> above it. (However about 95% 
			are still within 2<em>s</em> of the mean.)</p>

			<tr> 
				<td align="left"><strong>The mean and standard deviation are only 'complete' 
					summaries of the shape of a distribution when it is fairly symmetric.</strong></td>
			</tr>
