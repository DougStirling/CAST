<p class="heading">Layout of columns</p>
  <p>Think carefully about how to arrange the rows and columns.</p>
	<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
		<tr> 
			<td><strong>Values that you are interested in comparing should be close 
				to each other.</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
  <p>Reordering the rows and columns should be considered. Judicious use of white 
		space can help to separate different groups of values and therefore bring 
		related values closer together.</p>
	<p class="heading">Annotation</p>
  <p>When a table is included in a report, the main information that can be gained 
		from the table should also be summarised in the body of the report in words.</p>
	<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
		<tr> 
			<td><strong>Do not simply repeat the values in the table. The annotation 
				should summarise and interpret.</strong></td>
		</tr>

    <p class="heading">UN survey responses</p>

		
    <p>The table below was published in a United Nations report describing the 
			results of a survey of countries about implementation of a set of 'Fundamental 
			Principles of Official Statistics' by their National Statistics Offices. 
			The table summarises which countries responded to the survey questionnaire.</p>
		<table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../../en/tableDisplay/images/unRespondentTable.gif" width="524" height="349"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This table contains:</p>
	<ul>
      <li><strong>Two</strong> frequency tables &mdash; separately categorising the 
        countries that were sent the questionnaire (recipients) and those returning 
        the completed questionnaire (respondents) by region.</li>
      <li><strong>Two</strong> tables that categorise recipients and respondents 
        by development category. (Their presentation is non-standard since the 
        least developed countries are included in both of the first two rows.)</li>
      <li>A column of response rates for each development category and region.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because the columns of frequencies are not adjacent and the columns of percentages are not adjacent, 
      comparisons are harder. A better format for the table groups together the 
      columns of related values and separates these groups with white space.</p>
    <p>(We have also made improvements to the column headings and replaced the 
      first two rows of the table with the country categories <em>Least developed</em> 
      and <em>Other developing</em> to form a standard frequency table.)</p>
    <table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
      <tr> 
        <td><img src="../../en/tableDisplay/images/unRespondentTable2.gif" width="507" height="220"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="heading">Textual summary</p>
    <p>A description of the table in the report should point out the much higher 
      response rates in the developed countries, and particularly in Asia and 
      Europe. As a result, the 
      least developed countries (especially Oceania, the Americas and Africa) 
      are under-represented in the survey and in the remainder of the report.<br>
