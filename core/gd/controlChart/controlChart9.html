<p class="heading">Finding the <font color="#FF0000">cause</font> of problems</p>
  <p>Control charts (and other collected data) may indicate problems with a system. 
    For example, </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A clothing retailer discovers that sales have decreased over the previous 
      year.</li>
    <li>A manufacturer of plastic boxes finds that a sizeable proportion have 
      defects.</li>
    <li>An ecologist finds that sightings of a native bird have decreased in the 
      previous year.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, after detection of a problem, its <strong>cause</strong> must be 
    identified in order to rectify it. This is usually a non-trivial exercise 
    and the following tools often help.</p>
  <p class="heading">Brainstorming</p>
<p>Continuous quality improvement is usually performed by a team, and a good way 
to get ideas is with a <strong>brainstorming</strong> session. In this, all team 
members contribute short phrases that are written on either a large sheet of paper 
or individual scraps of paper (post-it notes are good). The points should be written 
down without discussion or editing, and all team members should be encouraged 
to contribute.</p>
<p>Once these ideas have been written down, they must be structured or grouped 
in some way.</p>

<p class="heading">Cause-and-effect diagrams</p>

<p>After possible causes for a problem have been contributed in a brainstorming 
session, they can be structured in a <strong>cause-and-effect</strong> diagram. 
In this,</p>
<ul>
<li>A horizontal arrow is drawn, and the problem is written at the end</li>
<li>A small number of main groupings for the causes are agreed on, and these are 
written at a distance above and below the centre line, with arrows drawn down 
to the line.</li>
<li>The individual causes are written (or post-it notes are attached) against 
the arrows for the main groupings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the shape of this diagram, it is often called a <strong>fishbone</strong> 
diagram.</p>
<p>This structuring of possible causes helps to focus attention on the most likely 
causes and on ones that may be altered in the 'Do' step in the Plan-Do-Check-Act 
cycle. </p>

<p class="heading">Failure rates in a university</p>

<p>University management has observed that failure rates in first-year papers 
have increased in the past ten years and want to understand the problem before 
adopting any new policies that may improve student performance.</p>
<p>The cause-and-effect diagram below shows potential causes for the problem that 
were suggested in a brainstorming session.</p>
