<p class=heading>Modelling other situations with probability</p>
<p>We often model a data set as a random sample from some population and  probability was introduced as a way of describing the randomness of such data. Probability is also used to model a 
  variety of other situations involving randomness.</p>
<p>The randomness of games of chance involving cards, dice or roulette 
wheels can often be expressed simply in probability terms. Sporting competitions 
can also often be modelled using fairly simple probability models. Such models 
usually simplify reality, but they may capture the essentials of behaviour.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Women's tennis match</p>

<p>A simple model for a tennis match between two players, A and B, will now be described. In this model, we will assume that:</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>Probability of A winning her serve = π<sub>1</sub></p>
  <p>Probability of B winning her serve = π<sub>2</sub></p>
  </div>
<p>We will also assume that the results of successive points are independent &mdash; winning one point does not make A more likely to win the next point too &mdash; and the standard rules of tennis are also part of the model. This is a simplification of a real tennis match but it could still be useful to determine 
how the probability of winning a whole match depends on π<sub>1</sub> and π<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>
<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
<p>How can a probability model be used to find information about such a the system? One 
way is to use the probabilities  to generate an <strong>instance</strong> of the system. If the model was to specify that something happens with a probability of 0.5, then we could toss a coin to generate an instance (with say <em>head</em> meaning that the event happens). Events with other probabilities can be  generated in a similar way on a computer.</p>
<p>Generating all 'events' in the model from the probabilities  in this way is called a <strong>simulation</strong> of the model. (The mechanism will be clarified in the example below.)</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Women's tennis match</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how randomly generated points can simulate a complete 
women's tennis match with 3 sets. Initially, both players are equally matched and have probability 0.75 of winning 
their serves.</p>

</div>
<p>Click <strong>Simulate Next Point</strong> 
to play a single point of the match &mdash; the computer randomly generates 
a result, based on the probability of the server winning the point. Click 
this button repeatedly to generate points until the match is completed. (Or hold it down to speed up the simulation.)</p>
<p>Click <strong>Start New Match</strong> to perform 
another simulation. Note that the precise sequence of points is unlikely 
to be repeated exactly in different simulations, even when the probabilities are 
the same in successive matches. (Before performing further simulations, you may 
use the sliders to adjust the probabilities winning individual points for the 
two competitors.)</p>
</div>

<p>In practice, we would rarely be interested in displaying as much detail in 
a simulation (except perhaps when checking that we have programmed the rules of 
the match properly!). We are usually interested in only one or two outcomes  (such as the identity of the winner or the total number of sets played in the match) 
and only these summaries need be displayed from each run of the simulation.</p>
