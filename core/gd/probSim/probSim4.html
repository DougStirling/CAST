<p class="heading">Interpreting a graphical summary of a sample</p>

<p>There is sample-to-sample variability in summary displays of samples from a population.
However in any practical situation we only have a single data set (sample),
so how can we use this knowledge of sample-to-sample variability?
</p>

<p>We can assess features such as outliers, clusters or skewness in a data set 
by examining how often they appear in random samples from a population <strong>without</strong> 
such features. In particular, we can examine variability in samples from a normal 
distribution that closely matches the shape of the data set. </p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Strength measurements</p>

<p>The diagram below describes measurements of the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('variation5')">maximum 
voluntary isometric strength</a> (MVIS) of 41 male students at the University 
of Hong Kong. </p>

<p>The top half of the diagram shows a box plot and jittered dot plot of the MVIS data.
There is an indication of skewness (a long tail to the distribution on the
right). Does this indicate that MVIS has a skew distribution or could it be simply a result of
sampling from a symmetric population?
</p>

<p>We examine the variability of similar displays from a symmetric normal distribution 
with similar centre and spread to the data. (The distribution's mean (23.78) and 
standard deviation (10.530) equal those of the data.) The bottom half of the display 
shows one such random sample from this normal population. Click <strong>Take sample</strong> 
a few times to observe the sample-to-sample variability of the sample displays. 
</p>

<p>Observe that there is rarely as much of an impression of skewness as that
shown by the box plot of the actual data. Since this degree of skewness is unlikely if the
population is a symmetric normal one, we can conclude that there is strong evidence that
MVIS has a skew distribution.
