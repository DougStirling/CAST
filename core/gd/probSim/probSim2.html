<p class=heading>Repetitions of  a simulation</p>

<p>Repeating a simulation and observing the 
  variability in the results can give insight into the randomness of the system's 
  behaviour.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Sport leagues</p>
<p>In many sports, teams are grouped into leagues, with each team playing every 
other team one or more times throughout during the year. Teams gain points for 
wins and draws and their total points are usually tabulated each week in newspapers. 
We will use a simulation to investigate how much the points in a league table 
reflect the randomness of individual matches and how much they depend on the abilities 
of the different teams.</p>
<p>In this page, we will consider a league with 10 teams in which each team plays each other twice and:</p>

<table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;Points from a match =&nbsp;</td>
    <td>3 if team wins<br>1 if team draws<br>0 if team loses</td></tr>
</table>

<p class=heading>Model </p>
<p>The first stage in any simulation is to produce a <strong>model</strong> for 
the process. In the league table example, such a model defines the probabilities 
of winning, drawing and losing for each match during the season. A good model 
would express these probabilities in terms of different abilities for the various 
teams (perhaps based on their results from the previous year), a home-team advantage 
and changes during the season. However a much simpler model can still provide 
useful insight.</p>

<p>We initially assume that the two teams in 
each match are equally likely to win. More precisely, in any match between teams 
<i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, we assume that </p>

<p style="color:#000000; margin-left:200px"><em>P</em> (<em> team i wins</em> ) &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>P</em> ( <em>team j wins </em>) &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0.4<br>
	<em>	P</em> ( <em>draw </em>) &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0.2</p>

<p>Click <strong>Run League</strong> to perform a simulation 
in which each pair of teams plays two matches (one at each team's home ground).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The table on the left shows the winners of all 90 matches (a cross means a draw)</li>
  <li>The  league table at the end of the season is shown in the middle</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Is the best team likely to be top of the league?
</p>

<p>We will now concentrate on a single team, Team A, and examine how its skill level affects its  league placing at the end of the season. This is shown by its <strong>rank</strong> at the end of the season on the dot plot at the right of the above diagram. (A rank of 1 means that the team was top
  or top equal in the league.)</p>
<p>With team A still equally likely to win and lose each match, click <strong>Accumulate</strong> and run the simulation
  several more times. Observe that
  Team A has (almost) the same chance of being in any position in the league at the end of the
  season.</p>
<p>The slider under the diagram allows us to adjust 
the probability of Team A winning its matches. (The other teams remain evenly 
matched.) Give Team A a probability of 0.55 of winning its matches &mdash; more than 
double its probability of losing &mdash; then repeat the simulation 100 times. 
</p>
<p>Observe that Team A often wins the league, but not always.</p>

<div class="boxed">
<p>Even with over double the the chance of winning than losing each match, Team A only ends the season on top of the league in about half of the simulations.</p>
</div>

<p>Indeed, 
  you will probably have observed that Team A's final placing was in the bottom 
  half of the league in several simulated seasons! </p>
</div>

<p>A simple probability model can often give valuable and perhaps surprising insight 
into a system through a simulation.</p>
