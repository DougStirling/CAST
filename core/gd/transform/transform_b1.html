<p class="heading">General idea of transformations</p>
	
<p>Sometimes it is convenient to express numbers on a different scale. For example, 
an American would easily recognise that a human body temperature of 102 degrees 
Fahrenheit indicates is unusually high, whereas in other countries temperatures 
are more easily 'understood' on the Celsius scale. This is called <strong>transformation</strong>.</p>
	<p>Some transformations are performed for the convenience of the reader (such 
		as the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion above), but transformation can also 
		be a useful tool that can help us understand a data set.</p>
	<p class="heading">Linear transformations</p>
	<p>Sometimes the values in a data set can be replaced by others holding exactly 
		the same information. For example, a fisheries researcher might record the 
		weights in grams of 28 trout that were caught in a particular river. If the 
		weights had been recorded in imperial measurements (ounces), the data set 
		would have contained equivalent information.</p>
	<p>When the new values are found from the original data by
an equation of the form</p>

  <p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>new value</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>a</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em> &nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>old value</strong></p>
	<p>it is called a <strong>linear transformation</strong> of the original values. 
    A linear transformation can change the centre and spread of the data, but 
    its shape otherwise remains unchanged. For graphical displays, only the numbers 
    labelling the axis changes. </p>
		
	<table width="75%" border="1" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    <tr>
		  <td align="center"><strong>Linear transformation changes the centre and 
				spread, but not the shape of a distribution.</strong></td>
	</tr>
</table>

  <p>Since the shape of the distribution is unaffected, linear transformations 
		do not help you to understand the distribution of values in the data.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Weights of trout</p>
<p>Weights in ounces and grams are related by the equation</p>

<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>grams</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp;28.3494&nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>ounces</strong></p>
<p>The dot plot below shows the trout weights that a fisheries researcher recorded.
The two axes allow the weights to be read off in grams and ounces
-- separate dot plots are not necessary.

  <p class="heading">Centre and spread</p>
	<p>The centre and spread of linearly transformed data can be easily found from 
		those of the original measurements. After a transformation of the form</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>new value</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>a</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em> &nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>old value</strong></p>
<p>the mean (and other measures of centre such as the median) are similarly 
		related</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>new mean</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>a</em> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;<em>b</em> &nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>old mean</strong></p>
	<p>The standard deviation (and other measures of spread that are expressed in 
		the same units as the raw data, such as the inter-quartile range) are related 
		with the equation.</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>new sd</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp;<em><font size="+1">|</font>b<font size="+1">|</font></em> &nbsp;× &nbsp;<strong>old sd</strong></p>
<p>Note that if the scale factor, b, is negative, we must change its sign since 
		the standard deviation must be positive.</p>
