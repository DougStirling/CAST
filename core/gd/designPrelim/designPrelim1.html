<p class=heading> What is the purpose of the experiment?</p>

<p>The initial stage in any data-collection exercise is to clearly state the objectives 
of the study. With no clear idea of the objectives of the study, it is unlikely 
that the data collected will contain suitable information. </p>
<p>It is essential that the researcher has a clear idea of what an experiment 
is being conducted to achieve. In defining the goals of the experiment, it is 
important that people with intimate knowledge of the process or subject area are 
included in the team which is charged with designing and running the experiment. 
</p>

<p>Many experiments are intended to solve a problem. After recognising that there 
is a problem, it needs to be carefully defined. Stating the problem clearly and 
obtaining general agreement that this statement really does describe the problem 
is imperative. Quite frequently,... </p>
