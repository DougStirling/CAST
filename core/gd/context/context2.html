<p class="heading">Answering a single question</p>

  <p>The simplest application of statistics is to answer a single question in 
		the context of some practical subject area. For example,</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>In a particular hospital, are waiting lists getting longer?</li>
		<li>Does an ultrasonic sound generator repel mice?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Answering the question involves the following steps.</p>
	
	<p class="eqn"><object data="images/simpleProcess.svg" width="384" height="275"></object></p>
	
  <p>Statistics has a role to play in all stages of this process.</p>
	<p class="heading">Feedback</p>
	<p>The simple process outlined above is appropriate for some problems where 
		data collection takes a long time and cannot be repeated. For example, it 
		often takes over a year to conduct agricultural experiments &mdash; researchers 
		only have a single opportunity to do their data collection, so they had better 
		get everything right first time!</p>
	<p>In most situations, the initial question is less well defined and a single 
		pass through the process is not enough. The information obtained from the 
		initial data generate further questions and we need to collect more data to 
		help answer them. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><object data="images/feedbackProcess.svg" width="324" height="275"></object></p>
	<p class="heading">Pilot studies</p>
	<p>Feedback is often designed into the statistical process. For example, sometimes 
		a small fraction of the data is initially collected and analysed. The information 
		obtained from this <strong>pilot study</strong> is used to refine the data 
		collection process. For example,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some questions in a survey questionnaire may be found to be ambiguous. 
			A rewording may help.</li>
		<li>In experiments involving animals, the measurements from each animal may 
			prove too difficult or expensive to record. Alternative measurements may 
			give equivalent results.</li>
		<li>In an experiment to determine the dose of an insecticide required to kill 
			half of a particular kind of beetle, the pilot study may use a wide range 
			of concentrations. After analysis of this pilot study, we may conduct the 
			main study on a narrower range of concentrations and therefore obtain more 
			accurate results.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The pilot study can also provide information about how much data must be 
		collected to give the desired accuracy in the main part of the study.</p>
	<p class="heading">Unexpected results</p>
	<p>Another example of feedback in the statistical process occurs when the initial 
		analysis reveals unusual or unexpected features in the data. Such features 
		may suggest further questions and therefore further data collection.</p>
