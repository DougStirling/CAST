<p class="heading">The notion of prediction</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Causal relationships</dt>
    <dd>In causal relationships, one variable is thought to directly affect the 
      other. When the value of the explanatory variable is determined from a further 
      individual (and its value may be under our control), we might hope to predict 
      the resulting value for the response.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      For example, the concentration of a chemical may be recorded after a reaction 
      is conducted at a variety of temperatures. We would like to predict the 
      concentration from future runs of the experiment at different temperatures.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
    </dd>
    <dt>Non-causal relationships</dt>
    <dd>In other situations, the relationship is not causal but we are still interested 
      in predicting the value of one variable from a known value of the other 
      variable.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      For example, accurate measurements of body fat are difficult to make, whereas 
      measurements of skinfold thickness are relatively easily found. It would 
      be useful to be able to predict body fat from skinfold thickness, based 
      on a dataset with both measurements from a group of people.</dd>
  </dl>
	<p class="heading">Notation and convention</p>
	<p>In both of the above cases, the variables can be classified as an <strong>explanatory 
    variable</strong> and a <strong>response</strong>. When we talk in general 
    about this type of data, we will use the letter<i> X</i> to denote the explanatory 
    variable and <i>Y</i> to denote the response.</p>
	<table width="75%" border="1" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Always draw the response variable, <i>Y</i>, on the vertical 
        axis of a scatterplot and <i>X</i> on the horizontal axis.</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p class="heading">Describing the form of the relationship</p>
	<p>The correlation coefficient describes the <strong>strength</strong> of the 
    relationship and whether the scatter of crosses on a scatterplot has positive 
    or negative slope, but it holds no information about the position of the crosses 
    on the scatterplot &mdash; the <strong>form</strong> of the relationship.</p>
	<p>The form of the relationship can be described by a <strong>straight line 
		or curve that lies close to the crosses</strong> in a scatterplot of <i>Y</i> 
		against <i>X</i>. Such a line is called a <strong>regression line</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Predicting the response from the regression line</p>
  <p>The regression line (i.e. the curve or straight line on the scatterplot that 
		describes the form of the relationship) can be drawn close to the crosses 
		'by eye'. (We will describe better objective ways to position the line later.)</p>
	<p>It is possible to use any such regression line to 'read off' the y-value 
		corresponding to any <em>x</em>. This provides a prediction of the likely 
		y-value that would be recorded if a new observation was made at this <em>x</em> 
		and can be expressed as</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>y</em> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <em>&fnof;</em> (<em> x</em> )</span></p>
	<p>where f() corresponds to the regression line.</p>

		<p>First position the grey curve to fit close to the data by dragging the 
			five red circles up and down. (This is a computer-based way to position 
			the curve 'by eye'.)</p>
		<p>When your curve is close to the points, click <strong>Finished sketching 
			curve</strong>. You can use the curve to make predictions of process impurity 
			at any temperature. <strong>Drag</strong> the red vertical line towards 
			the left or right to see these predictions.</p>
