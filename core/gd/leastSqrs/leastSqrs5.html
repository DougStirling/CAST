<p class="heading">A simple linear model is not always appropriate</p>

  <p>A simple linear model for a response  Y in terms of an explanatory variable X is often a useful summary of a relationship, but is not appropriate 
		for all data sets.</p>
  <div class="boxed">
  	<p>A simple linear model is only appropriate when the cloud of crosses 
  		in a scatterplot of the data is regularly spread around a straight line.</p>
  </div>
  <p>If the crosses are scattered round a curve, the relationship is called <strong>nonlinear</strong> 
    and other models must be used. We will consider nonlinear models in the next 
    section.</p>
	<p>In this page, we examine another problem.</p>
	<p class="heading">Outliers should be investigated</p>
	<p>An <strong>outlier</strong> is an observation that does not conform to the 
		pattern and variability exhibited by the rest of the data. In a linear model, 
		the most important type of outlier is a data point that lies at a distance 
		from the line that would fit through the rest of the data. </p>

<p>The individual corresponding to any outlier should be carefully examined. Recording
or transcription errors may be the cause. Alternatively, it may be possible to determine some
distinguishing characteristic of the individual that underlies the unusual response
measurement.
</p>

<p>If an outlier is extreme enough, or if a special cause for its unusual behaviour can be
found from outside information, the individual can be classified as aberrant
and deleted from the data set.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>It is important to <strong>look at any data set graphically</strong> before fitting a linear model to check that  no curvature or outliers are present.</p>

<p class="heading">Temperature and latitude</p>

<p>The scatterplot below shows the maximum January temperature (degrees Fahrenheit) and
latitude (degrees north of the equator) for various cities in the USA, as published in the book
<cite>Data Analysis and Regression</cite>, by F.Mosteller and J.W.Tukey in 1977. The least
squares line is superimposed on the data.

<p>There are four unusually large residuals that might be considered to be outliers.
They are all considerably warmer than the model would predict for their latitude.
<strong>Dragging</strong> with the mouse over the four points reveals their names and
highlights their positions on a map of the USA.
</p>

    <p>You may have noticed that one of the outliers, Jacksonville, is too far 
      north on the map. <strong>The latitude of Jacksonville was wrongly recorded</strong> 
      in the published data set as 38 degrees instead of 30 degrees. Click the 
      checkbox <strong>Correct Jacksonville</strong> to change Jacksonville's 
      latitude to 30 degrees. Note that the position of the least squares line 
      is not affected much. </p>

<p>The remaining three outliers are Portland, Seattle and Juneau. These are all
in the northwest of the USA, and a little geographical research shows that they are
warmed by a sea current in the winter. Retaining these cities causes us to overestimate the
temperatures of other high-latitude cities. Their common characteristic suggests that
we should perhaps model the northwest of the USA separately from the remainder of the country.
Click the checkbox <strong>Delete NorthWest</strong> to remove the three cities.
The least squares line now fits much closer to the remaining data points.
