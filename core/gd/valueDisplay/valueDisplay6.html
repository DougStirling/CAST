<p class="heading">Too many or too few stems</p>

<p>Sometimes a basic stem and leaf plot has
only between 2 and 5 distinct stems. Changing the stem units would give
between 20 and 50 stems &mdash; too many classes to clearly show the density of
values by the heights of the stacks of leaves.
</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Isometric Strength data</p>

    <p>In an ergonomic study involving a group of 41 male students from the University 
	  of Hong Kong, each student was asked to exert maximum upward force on a 
	  horizontal bar which was close to floor level, with his feet 400mm away 
	  from the bar. The force was averaged over a 5-second period is called the 
	  'maximum voluntary isometric strength' (MVIS) and is recorded in kilograms.</p>
	  
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td valign="top"> 
<p>With the leaves as the 'units' digits, most values are stacked on stems '1' 
and '2'. The stem-and-leaf plot does not show the shape of the distribution well 
within the interval 10 to 29 kg.</p>
</td>
<td>
<object data="images/mvisStemLeaf1.svg" width="173" height="97"></object>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"> 
<p>However making the leaves the 'tenths' digits results in too many distinct 
stems for a data set of this size.</p>
<p>The stem and leaf plot is rather jagged. Also, all leaves are '0' since the 
raw data were recorded as whole numbers, so there is no advantage over a stacked 
dot plot.</p>
</td>
<td>
<object data="images/mvisStemLeaf2.svg" width="172" height="514"></object>
</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p class="heading">Extra flexibility</p>
<p>It is possible to extend the basic stem and leaf plot to display an intermediate 
number of classes (stacks of leaves).</p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Each distinct stem from the basic plot can be split into either 2 
or 5 different classes.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This increases the number of stems by a factor or either 2 or 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the stems are split into two, each stem is listed twice in the stem
	and leaf plot, with leaf values 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 stacked on the lower of the repeats
	and leaves 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 on the higher repeat.</li>
  <li>If the stems are split into five, each stem is listed five times in the stem
	and leaf plot, with leaf values (0 and 1), (2 and 3), (4 and 5), (6 and 7) and (8 and 9)
	on the different repeats of the stem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again the idea is explained more clearly with an example than in words.</p>

<p>Click on the <strong>Animate</strong> button to see the stems split
into two. Note the leaves that end on each stem. The slider can be used
to repeat the animation more slowly.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Split into 5</strong> from the pop-up menu, then repeat the animation.</p>

<p class="heading">Another example</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Guinea Pig Survival</p>

<p>The stem and leaf plot below shows the survival times (in days) of 72 guinea 
pigs that were injected with tubercle bacilli. </p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="300" height="250">

<param name="discardDigits" value="1">
</applet>
</div>

<p>The survival times ranged between 43 and 598 days, so the stems are hundreds 
and each leaf is the 'tens' digit of a value. Note that the 'units' digits of 
the values are not shown on the stem and leaf plot. </p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>The stem and leaf provide the most significant digits of each value. 
</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Click on the top leaf of '<strong>9</strong>' that is drawn against the stem 
'<font color="#0000FF"><strong>5</strong></font>' and observe that it corresponds 
to the value <font color="#0000FF"><strong>5</strong></font><strong>9</strong>8 
days. Drag with the mouse over other leaves and observe how each survival time 
is represented in the diagram. </p>

<p><font color="#666666">(You may notice that the values are not rounded to the 
nearest leaf digit, but are truncated. This is done to simplify drawing the plot 
by hand and should not affect your interpretation of the plot.)</font></p>
