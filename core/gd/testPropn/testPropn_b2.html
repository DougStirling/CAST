<p class=heading>Test statistic</p>
<p>When testing the value of a probability, π, 
  the obvious statistic to use from our random sample is the corresponding sample 
  proportion, <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>It is however more convenient to use the <strong>number</strong> of successes, <em>x</em>, rather than <em>p</em> since we know that <em>X</em> has a <strong>binomial distribution</strong> with 
  parameters <em>n</em> (the sample size) and π.</p>
<center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="50%">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><span style="color:#000000"><em>X</em> &nbsp; ~ &nbsp; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">binomial</font> (<em>n</em>, π)</span></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p>When we know the distribution of the test statistic (at least after the null 
  hypothesis has fixed the value of the parameters of interest), it becomes much 
  easier to obtain the p-value for the test.</p>
<p class=heading>P-value</p>
<p>As in all other tests, the p-value is the probability of getting such an 'extreme' 
  set of data if the null hypothesis is true. Depending on the null and alternative 
  hypotheses, the p-value is therefore the probability that <em>X </em>is as big 
  (or sometimes as small) as the recorded value.</p>
<p>Since we know the binomial distribution of <em>X</em> when the null hypothesis 
  holds, the p-value can therefore be obtained by adding binomial probabilities.</p>
<center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><strong>The p-value is a sum of binomial probabilities</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p>Note that the p-value can be obtained exactly <strong>without need for simulations 
  or randomisation</strong>.</p>

<p class=heading>Scaring whales from fishing boats</p>

<p>Whales have probability 0.4 of immediately leaving when encountering boats 
that are fishing in the North Atlantic. When a device emitting the sound of a 
killer whale is used, 15 out of 30 whales stay. Is the device effective?</p>

<p class="eqn"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.4</p>
<p class="eqn"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.4</p>

<p>In the diagram below, click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then hold down <strong>Simulate</strong> 
until about 100 samples of 30 whales have been generated. The proportion of these 
simulated samples in which 15 or more leave is an approximation to the p-value 
for the test.</p>

</div>

<p>Since we know that the number leaving has a binomial&nbsp;(30, 0.4) distribution 
when the null hypothesis holds, <font color="#CC0000">the simulation is unnecessary</font>. 
Select<strong> Binomial distribution</strong> from the pop-up menu. This binomial 
distribution is displayed, and the probability of 15 or more whales leaving is 
shown to be 0.1754 &mdash; the p-value for the test.</p>
<p>Since the p-value is not small, the observed data could easily have arisen 
even if the device was ineffective. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence 
that the device is effective. Note that this can be done <strong>without any simulations</strong>.</p>
