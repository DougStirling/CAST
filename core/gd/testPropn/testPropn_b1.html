<p class=heading>Inference and random samples</p>

<p>The examples in the previous section involved a range of different types of 
model for the observed data. In the remainder of this chapter, we concentrate 
on one particular type of model &mdash; random sampling from a population.</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<td><strong>We assume now that the observed data are a <font color="#FF0000">random 
sample from some population</font>.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>When the observed data are a random sample, inference asks questions about 
characteristics of the underlying population distribution &mdash; unknown population 
parameters.</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="white" width="75%">
<tr> 
<td><strong>For random samples, the null and alternative hypotheses specify values 
for the unknown population parameters.</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p class=heading>Inference about categorical populations</p>
<p>When the population distribution is categorical, the unknowns are the population 
probabilities for the different categories. To simplify, we consider populations 
for which one category is of particular interest ('success') and we denote the 
unknown probability of success by π.</p>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses are therefore specified in terms of π.</p>

<p class=heading>Scaring whales from fishing boats</p>

<p>Researchers try to assess whether the sound of a killer whale helps to scare 
away whales from fishing boats. A proportion 0.4 normally leave immediately the 
boat arrives, but 15 out of 30 leave when the sound it transmitted.</p>
<p>We model the whales' reactions as a random sample of 30 categorical values 
from a population with probability π 
of success (leaving). The null hypothesis of interest is therefore...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.4</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.4</p>
<p class=heading>Rat recognition of symbols</p>
<p>Can rats can distinguish between three different symbols? In an experiment, 
three food containers marked with a circle, square and cross are placed in a cage. 
A card marked with one of these symbols is shown to the rat and the corresponding 
box is unlocked, allowing access to food. </p>
<p>A rat is initially trained with 100 randomly selected cards (and corresponding 
unlocked containers). The experiment is then repeated a further 90 times and the 
researcher notes the number of times the rat goes to the correct container. Out 
of 90 repetitions, the rat chooses the correct container 36 times.</p>
<p>This situation can be modelled as random sampling of 90 values (correct or 
wrong) from a categorical population in which the probability of choosing the 
correct container is π. 
The null hypothesis of interest is therefore...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(guessing)</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(learned)</p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Tests about parameters of other populations</p>

<p>Other data sets arise as random samples from different kinds of population. 
For example, numerical data sets are often modelled as random samples from a normal 
distribution. Again, the hypotheses of interest are usually expressed in terms 
of the parameters of this distribution.</p>
<p>For example, to test whether the mean of a normal distribution is zero, the 
hypotheses would be...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; µ&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section, we show how to test a population probability, 
and in the next section we will describe tests about a population mean.</p>
