<p class=heading>Variability in individuals</p>

  <p>Most statistical data sets consist of a data matrix where different measurements 
		are made from a collection of 'individuals' (e.g. people, plants, houses, 
		bank accounts, etc.). These individuals are not identical so measurements 
		made from them also vary from individual to individual.</p>
	<p class=heading>Unavoidable variability in measurements</p>
	<p>Even when the 'individuals' are very similar, the recorded measurements from 
		them often vary due to:</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Variability of the environment in which the measurements were made</dt>
		<dd>Different trees in a plantation will be grown on soil with differing nutrients 
			and drainage and may receive different amounts of light.</dd>
		<dt>Variability in the measurement procedure itself</dt>
		<dd>A valuer's assessment of the likely sale price of a house could be different 
			if the same house was valued the following day or by a different valuer. 
			Even physical measurements such as a person's blood pressure or abdomen 
			circumference are rarely measured without some variability.</dd>
	</dl>
	<br>
	<hr width="75%">
	<p>For the above reasons, the measurements in a data set are likely to vary 
		from individual to individual.</p>

		<p>Observe that the yield from the tomato plants varies considerably, due 
			to differences in genetics, unavoidable small differences in the growing 
			environment and other chance occurrences.</p>
