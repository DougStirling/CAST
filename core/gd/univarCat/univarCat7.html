<p class="heading">Bar charts for quantities</p>

<p>Bar charts are most commonly used to show frequencies for discrete or categorical 
data.</p>
<p>However it is also acceptable to use a bar chart to display any <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('transform3')">quantity 
data</a>. (Quantity data are 'amounts' of something and are always positive. Since 
it is meaningful to say that one quantity is double another, quantity data are 
also called <strong>ratio variables</strong>.)</p>
<p>A bar chart can therefore be used to show how a quantity changes over time 
(a kind of time series plot) or to show how a total quantity is split between 
categories. </p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">New Zealand wine production</p>

<p>The bar chart below shows how the area in New Zealand used for vineyards changed 
between 1962 and 2001. (Area is a quantity &mdash; doubling the area is a meaningful 
concept.)</p>

</div>

<p>Select <strong>Production</strong> from the pop-up menu to see how wine production 
changed over this period. In contrast to the steady increase in vineyard area, 
wine production has fluctuated markedly since 1980 and has levelled off.</p>
<p>Another interesting measurement for producers is the ratio of production to 
area &mdash; the production per acre. Select <strong>Production per hectare</strong> 
from the pop-up menu to see how this has changed. Production per hectare has steadily 
dropped since 1970.</p>
<p>Possible explanations are...</p>
<ul>
<li>The area of vineyards has increased sharply since 1990, so a large part of 
the total area will have young vines that are not yet fully productive.</li>
<li>Production has moved to regions that are less well suited to growing grapes.</li>
<li>Vineyards are now growing varieties that produce better quality wine but of 
a lower quantity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information is required to assess these explanations and fully understand 
this pattern.</p>
<p>Select the option <strong>Time Series</strong> from the pop-up menu on the 
left. Since the data were recorded each year, time series plots can also be used 
to display them.</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">Pie charts for quantities</p>

<p>Pie charts can also be used to display quantity data, but there is an additional 
requirement that must be satisfied before a pie chart is used. <strong>The total 
of all the data that are displayed must itself be meaningful</strong>.</p>
<p>It is unfortunately common for pie charts to be used in situations where the 
total is not a meaningful quantity. Make sure that you recognise such misleading 
pie charts and do not draw them yourself.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">World crude oil production</p>

<p>The pie chart below shows the source of all crude oil produced in 2000.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="500" height="200">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="catProg.PieChartApplet">
<param name="catVarName" value="Crude oil production">
<param name="catValues" value="10811@0 6397@1 6167@2 7888@3 21844@4 7469@5 7529@6">

<param name="propnDecs" value="2">
<param name="countName" value="'000 barrels / day">
</applet>
</div>

<p>This pie chart is not based on categorical data (a list of categorical measurements 
from individuals), but shows how a continuous total (the total world oil production) 
is split into categories. </p>
<hr width="75%">

&nbsp; 
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">

<td><strong>The following example shows data that should <font color="#FF0000">not</font> 
be displayed in a pie chart.</strong></td>

<p class="heading">Infant deaths from abuse</p>

<p>The pie chart below was published in a New Zealand newspaper as part of an 
article on child abuse.</p>

<div class="centred"><object data="images/bad_pie.svg" width="456" height="332"></object></div>
<p>Since the value from each country is a rate of deaths per 100,000 live births, 
it is meaningless to add these for different countries &mdash; the total cannot be 
interpreted. <strong>A pie chart should therefore not be used</strong>.</p>
<p>A bar chart would be a better display of these data. (It would also allow more 
accurate comparisons between the rates in different countries &mdash; it is fairly 
difficult to compare the areas of different slices above.)</p>
