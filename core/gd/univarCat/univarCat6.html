<p class="heading">Chartjunk</p>
  
<p>As with bar charts, pie charts are often graphical representations of a small 
number of values. For example, a pie chart of the gender of students in a class 
is only based on a single value, the proportion of males. As a result, there is 
a temptation to 'enhance' pie charts as 3-dimensional objects &mdash; chartjunk.</p>
<p>Resist the temptation &mdash; it does not make the data any easier to understand 
and may indeed be misleading since 3-dimensional pie charts can over-emphasise 
the categories closest to the viewer.</p>

<div class="diagram">
  
<p class="heading">Kestrel deaths</p>

<p>The 3-dimensional pie chart below shows causes of death of kestrels in Britain 
between 1963 and 1997. </p>

<div class="centred"><object data="images/kestrel3DPie.svg" width="474" height="204"></object>
</div>
<p>The viewpoint tends to make the closest categories appear too large. In particular, 
<em>Disease</em> incorrectly appears to be as common a cause of death as <em>Unknown</em>. 
(There were 77 deaths caused by <em>Disease</em> and 114 of <em>Unknown</em> cause.)</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Small is beautiful</p>

<p>In general, it is better to draw a standard pie chart smaller rather than embellishing 
it with chartjunk.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Marital status on first birth</p>

<p>As part of a study in the USA of trends in the marital status of women when 
they had their first child, data from the 1995 Current Population Survey were 
examined. The 'exploded' pie chart below describes those who had their first child 
when aged 15 to 29.</p>

</div>
<p>The simpler small pie chart below shows the data more clearly. </p>
