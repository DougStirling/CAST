<p class="heading">Known differences between the experimental units</p>
<p>When nothing is known about the differences between the experimental units 
  before the experiment is conducted, we can do no better than to randomise allocation 
  of treatments to the units. Randomisation avoids systematic over- or under-estimation 
  of treatment effects. However...</p>

<p class="heading">Randomised block design</p>
<p>The greater the variability between experimental units, the more the resulting variability within treatments (noise) tends to mask  differences between the treatments (signal).</p>
<p>In practice,  a researcher often has little influence on the choice of experimental units and they can very variable. More accurate estimates are obtained if they can be grouped together before the experiment is conducted in groups<strong> </strong>of similar units called <strong>blocks</strong>. A separate experiment is conducted within each block with an equal number of treatments of each type randomly allocated to the experimental units in the block. Although all data are analysed together, the lower variability of experimental units with each block means that differences between the treatments can be more accurately estimated.</p>
<p>Since treatments are randomly allocated within blocks, this design is called a <strong>randomised block design</strong>.</p>
<div class="diagram">
<p class=heading>Effect of irrigation on grass growth</p>
<p>A researcher wants to conduct an experiment to assess how irrigation affects grass growth. Three levels of irrigation will be used (none, a little or a lot) and they can only be applied to whole fields. As a result, the experimental units are fields and the available fields close to the research station differ in soil type and fertility.</p>

  <p>We will initially examine a completely randomised design. The 36 pictures above represent the 36 available fields. Click <strong>Randomise treatments</strong> a few times to show how the 12 fields getting each level of irrigation are randomly allocated to the 36 fields.</p>
  <p>If the researcher has some prior knowledge of the each of these fields, they can be grouped together in blocks. Select <strong>Randomised block</strong> from the pop-up menu to group similar fields together into three groups.</p>
  <p>Click <strong>Randomise treatments</strong> a few times to randomly allocate each of the treatments to 4 of the 12 fields within each block. Note that the randomisation is applied within each block.</p>
</div>
<p>Each treatment is applied the same number of times within each block, so if the experimental units within one block tend to have a higher mean response all treatments are affected equally. As a result, differences between the treatments are more accurately estimated.</p>

  <p class=heading>Uptake of amino acids by fish</p>
  <p>In an investigation of the effect of sodium cyanide (NaCN) on the uptake <em>in 
    vitro</em> of a particular amino acid by intestinal preparations of a certain 
    species of fish, it was found that each fish would give only about six preparations.</p>
  <p>Since there could be sizeable differences between individual fish, the fish 
    were treated as blocks (of size 6). The table below shows uptake of the amino 
    acid (Âµmol 
    per g dry weight in a 20 minute period) for four fish. The two treatments were 
    randomly allocated to the six intestinal preparations from each fish in a randomised block design.</p>

  <p>Fish 3 has a mean uptake that is considerably lower than the other fish. However since each treatment is used with the same number of samples from this fish, its lower uptake levels  equally affect the two blue treatment means on the left of the table. The use of a fish with such a low amino acid uptake therefore does not affect the <strong>relative</strong> values of the two blue means.</p>
  <p>Differences between the fish (blocks) do not therefore affect the accuracy of comparisons between the treatments &mdash; this gives us more confidence that the use of NaCN decreases amino acid uptake by around 0.5.</p>
</div>
<p class="heading">Comparison of completely randomised and randomised block designs</p>
<p>If we know anything about differences between the experimental units before the experiment is conducted, it is always worthwhile to group them into blocks  and conduct a randomised block design &mdash; the effects of the treatments 
  will be estimated more accurately.</p>
<p>The benefits are greatest when there are large differences between the mean response in different blocks &mdash; if all blocks are essentially the same, there is nothing to be gained from using 
  a randomised block design.</p>

<p class=heading>Comparing tender and auction of houses</p>

<p>Many cities built estates of low-cost rental housing in the 1950s and 1960s 
and are now selling these to tennants. The diagram below simulates the sale of 
24 houses of identical design. In order to assess whether offering the houses 
for tender (with the highest bid by a fixed date buying the house) or auction 
achieves the best sale price, an experiment is conducted, with 12 of the houses 
being sold by tender and the others by auction.</p>

<p>The top half of the diagram conducts 
  a completely randomised experiment and the bottom half conducts a randomised block 
  experiment. Both  experiments use the same 24 houses and, in each case, half are sold by auction and half by tender &mdash; the ticks on houses represent those being sold by auction. Click <strong>Repeat</strong> several times for each of the experiments.</p>
<p>Observe 
  that the estimated effect of auctioning (the difference between the price for auction and tender) is much more variable for the completely 
  randomised experiment. The randomised block experiment therefore provides a more 
  consistent (and accurate) estimate of the effect of auctioning.</p>
<p>The three districts (blocks) are initially very different &mdash; there is a strong 
  block effect on the house prices due to the different locations. Select <strong>Districts are essentially the same</strong> from the pop-up menu, then repeat the experiments. Observe that there is 
  now no advantage in using a randomised block experiment &mdash; it no longer estimates 
  the effect of auctioning any more accurately than the completely randomised 
  design.</p>
