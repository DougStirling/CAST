<p class="heading">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
<p>An experiment is usually conducted in order to determine how some response 
is affected by one or more types of potential influences.</p>

<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
one or more explanatory variables<strong>.</strong></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For example, a researcher may wish to determine...</p>

<ul>
<li>How is the surface finish of a component that is manufactured in a lathe affected 
by the rotation speed of the lathe?</li>
<li>Does asprin lower blood pressure after an operation?</li>
<li>Which of four varieties of sweet corn have highest yields?</li>
<li>How much will weekly sales be increased if the supermarkets in a chain are 
closed later than the usual 8pm?</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
Depending on the type of experiment, these units may be...</p>

<ul>
<li>people</li>
<li>animals</li>
<li>trees</li>
<li>areas in a field</li>
<li>shops in a retail chain</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>In the experiments that we will examine here,...</p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>A single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.<strong></strong></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The definition of the experimental units is therefore closely associated with 
decisions about the response measurement that will be taken. For example, if a 
farmer is interested in the milk yield of a herd of cows, it may be decided that 
monthly measurements will be made from each cow. Each combination of a cow and 
a month would be considered to be a separate experimental unit.</p>
<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit &mdash; perhaps a numerical 
characteristic such as the temperature at which a chemical reaction is conducted 
or a categorical characteristic such as the variety of wheat that is planted. 
</p>
<p>These controlled characteristics are the explanatory variables and are called 
<strong>factors</strong> in the context of an experiment. The different values 
of the controlled characteristics are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>

<tr> 
<td><strong>Each experimental unit receives some treatment.<strong></strong></strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>The decision about which of the different treatments is applied to 
each experimental unit is called the <strong><font color="#FF0000">experimental 
design</font>.</strong></strong></td>
