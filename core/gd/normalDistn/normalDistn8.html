<p class="heading">Standard normal probabilities without a computer</p>

<p>Questions about normal distributions can be answered in terms of areas under 
a standard normal probability density. These areas might be obtained very roughly 
by eye from a graph, but a computer should be used to evaluate the area more accurately. 
For example, most spreadsheets contain functions to evaluate standard normal probabilities.</p>
<p>Similar calculations can be done <strong>without a computer</strong>. Most 
introductory statistics textbooks contain printed tables with left-tail probabilities 
for the standard normal distribution. </p>

</p>

<p>These tables can be used after the required probability has been translated 
into a problem relating to the standard normal distribution.</p>
<p>Note that...</p>

<ul>
<li>The probability of getting a z-value <strong>greater</strong> than 1.26 is 
one minus the probability obtained above</li>
<li>The probability of getting a z-value between 0.26 and 1.26 is the <strong>difference</strong> 
between the areas to the left of these values (from the graph or from tables).</li>
</ul>
