<p class="heading">Sampling with replacement from finite populations</p>

<p>When selecting a random sample <strong>with replacement</strong> from a finite 
population, each successive value does not depend on earlier values, so the sample 
is an independent random sample. The formula that we gave earlier for the standard 
deviation of sample means is therefore still appropriate</p>
<p class=eqn><span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaXbar.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp;<span class="black">=</span>&nbsp; <span style="position:relative; top:12px"><img src="../../images/symbol.sigmaOverRootN.png" width="26" height="31" align="baseline"></span> &nbsp; &nbsp; where &nbsp; &nbsp; <img class="gif" width="114" height="49"></p>
<p>Note that the formula for the population standard deviation, Ïƒ, 
uses divisor <em>N</em>, the number of values in the population, rather than (<em>N</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1). 
The distinction between these two divisors was <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('centerSpread6')">mentioned 
when the standard deviation was initially defined</a>.</p>
<p class="heading">Sampling without replacement from finite populations</p>
<p>The above formula does not hold when the sample values are dependent on each 
other in any way. We saw that <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('randomMean4')">when 
the sample values are positively correlated (i.e. they tend to be similar), the 
formula overstates the accuracy of the sample mean.</a></p>
<p>The opposite happens when a random sample is selected <strong>without replacement</strong> 
from a finite population. The successive values are again dependent &mdash; after a 
large value is selected, it cannot be selected again, so the next value will tend 
to be lower. The sample values are therefore negatively correlated.</p>
<p>Provided only a small fraction of the population is sampled (say under 5%), 
the dependence is slight and can usually be ignored. However if the sampling fraction 
is higher, the earlier formula should be corrected since it understates the accuracy 
of the sample mean. The correct formula is</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/randomMean/images/sdMeanSWOR.gif" width="138" height="45"> </p>
<p>The quantity (<em>N </em>- <em>n</em>) / (<em>N</em> - 1) is called the <strong>finite 
population correction factor</strong>.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> to select a random sample of 2 of these 
values (without replacement). The sample mean is shown in the lower half of the 
diagram with a normal distribution whose standard deviation is calculated <strong>without</strong> 
the finite population correction factor.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Finite population correction</strong> to show the effect of the 
correction factor. Since only a small fraction of the population is sampled, there 
is little difference.</p>
<p>Turn off the correction factor, increase the sample size to 14, then take several 
samples. The jittered dot plot of the sample means shows a distribution with much 
lower spread than the normal distribution. After turning on the correction factor, 
the normal distribution matches the actual spread of the distribution of sample 
means.</p>
<p>Increase the population size to 48 and again observe that the correction factor 
has little effect when a small fraction of the population is sampled, but is important 
when the sampling fraction is high.</p>
