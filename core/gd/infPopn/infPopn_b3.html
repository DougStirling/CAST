<p class=heading>Data that are <span class="style1">not</span> sampled from a finite population</p>
<p>Sometimes  data are actually sampled from a real finite population. For example, 
  a public opinion poll may select individuals from the population of all residents 
  in a city. The previous section showed that:</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>Random sampling of values from a finite population can explain the sample-to-sample variability of <strong>some</strong> data.</p>
</div>
<p>However there is   no real finite population underlying most data sets   from which the values can be treated 
as being sampled. The randomness in such data must be explained in a different way.</p>

<p class=heading>Silkworm poisoning</p>

<p>In an investigation of the speed of the toxic action of arsenic on silkworm 
larvae, 80 fourth-instar silkworm larvae weighing between 0.41 and 0.45 grams 
were given 0.10&nbsp;mg of sodium arsenate per gram of body weight. Their survival 
times in seconds are given below. </p>

<p>There is no real finite population from which the survival times can be considered 
to be sampled. However there is variability within this data set and repeating 
the experiment would have resulted in a different set of survival times. </p>
</div>
<p class="heading">Sampling from an abstract  population</p>
<p>Random sampling from a population is such an intuitive way to explain sample-to-sample variability, we also use it to explain variability even when there is no <strong>real</strong> population from which the data were sampled.</p>
<p>We replace the real population that usually underlies survey data  with an <strong>abstract</strong> population of <strong>all values that might have been obtained</strong> if the data collection had been repeated. We can then treat the observed data as a random sample from this abstract population.</p>
<div class="boxed">
  <p>The variation in the underlying abstract population gives us information about the variation in similar data <strong>in general</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>Defining such an underlying population therefore not only explains sample-to-sample variability but also gives us a focus for generalising from  our specific data.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Silkworm poisoning</p>
<p>It is convenient to model the variability in his data as being a sample from 
the infinite population of <strong>all possible measurements</strong> that could 
have been made from similar silkworm larvae. The variability in this hypothetical 
population reflects the variability in the survival times.</p>
    <p>The distribution of survival times in the sample of poisoned silkworms 
      provides information about the distribution of this underlying population 
      &mdash; the distribution of survival times of silkworms given 0.10&nbsp;mg of 
      sodium arsenate per gram of body weight <strong>in general</strong>.</p>
