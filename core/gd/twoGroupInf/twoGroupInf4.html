<p class="heading">Testing for a difference between the two population means</p>

<p>When samples are obtained from two groups, we often want to assess whether there is
any evidence of a difference between the groups. Differences between the groups may involve
differences between the spreads, skewness or other features of the distributions in the two
groups. However the difference of most practical importance is a difference between the
<strong>means</strong> of the groups.
</p>

<p class=eqn><span class="blue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub> &minus; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub> &minus; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 0</strong></span></p>

<p>The summary statistic that throws most light on these hypotheses is the difference
between the sample means,
<span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>.
Testing therefore involves assessment of whether this difference is unusually far from zero.
</p>

  <p class="heading">Test statistic and p-value</p>
  <p>The difference <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span> 
	is standardised (by dividing by an estimate of its standard deviation) and 
	this t-statistic is compared to a t distribution, as shown in the diagram 
	below. </p>

<p class=eqn><object data="images/pValue.svg" width="454" height="266"></object>
</p>

<p>As with all other hypothesis tests, a p-value near zero gives evidence that 
the null hypothesis does not hold &mdash; evidence of a difference between the group 
means. </p>

<p class="heading">Properties of p-values</p>

<p>It is important to understand that a statistical hypothesis test cannot provide 
a definitive answer about whether two groups have different means. The randomness 
of sample data means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>p-values are also random quantities, and</li>
<li>there is some chance of us being misled by an 'unlucky' sample. </li>
</ul>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Simulation when the underlying means are the same (H<sub>0</sub> is true)</p>
<p>The diagram below allows samples of size 20 to be selected from two populations, both
of which are normal with mean 75 and standard deviation 8.</p>

<p>Take several samples and observe the variation in the resulting p-value. The 
p-values are <strong>usually</strong> greater than 0.1, so we would <strong>usually</strong> 
conclude that there is no evidence of a difference between the means.</p>
<p>However about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of the p-values are less than 0.1,

<p>In the next simulation, the underlying population means are 70 and 80 &mdash; a

<p>Again take several random samples from the model. Observe that the p-value 
is <strong>usually</strong> very close to zero and we <strong>usually</strong> 
conclude that there is strong evidence that the population means are different.</p>
<p>However <strong>occasionally</strong> the sample means are closer and the p-value 
is larger. </p>

<p class="heading">Effect of sample size on the chance of making a 'wrong' conclusion.</p>

<p>There are two types of possible error when reaching a conclusion with a hypothesis 
test. It is instructive to note how increasing the sample size affects the probabilities 
of these two types of error.</p>
<p><font color="#999999">(The results hold for <strong>all</strong> types of hypothesis 
test, not just for comparisions of two population means.)</font></p>

<dl>
<dt>If the population means are really the same (H<sub>0</sub> holds):</dt>
<dd>There is always probability 0.01 of getting a p-value of 0.01 or lower, irrespective 
of the sample size. <strong>Increasing sample size therefore does not reduce the 
chance of making this sort of error.</strong></dd>
<dt>If the population means are really different (H<sub>A</sub> holds):</dt>
<dd>As the sample size increases, the p-value becomes closer to zero &mdash; the probability 
of getting a p-value below 0.01, say, approaches 1.<strong> If the population 
means really are different, increasing the sample size makes you more likely to 
detect this difference.</strong> </dd>
