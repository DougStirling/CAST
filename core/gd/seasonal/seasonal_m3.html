<p class="heading">Limitations of moving averages</p>

  <p>We used moving averages to smooth out the seasonal variation in a time series, 
		but this method has serious limitations.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Moving averages cannot be used for the ends of a time series. For monthly 
			data, this means that we cannot remove the seasonal variation from the last 
			6 months &mdash; usually the most important part of the series!</li>
		<li>The method does not provide forecasts of future values in the series.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="heading">Estimating a common seasonal effect</p>
	<p>If we assume that the underlying seasonal pattern is the same in each year, 
    this common seasonal pattern can be estimated. Our estimates are based on 
    the <strong>residuals</strong> from the moving averages that were used to 
    smooth out the seasonal variation. (The residuals are the differences between 
    the actual values and the smoothed values.)</p>
	<p>For monthly data, we can estimate a 'January effect' by averaging the difference 
		between actual January values and their smoothed values. For example, if January 
		values were on average 5 higher than their smoothed values, the seasonal effect 
		for January would be 5. Negative values for the seasonal effect correspond 
		to months where the values are, on average, lower than their smoothed values.</p>

<p>The time series plot below shows mean monthly temperature in Boulder Colorado
and a 12-point moving average that smooths out the seasonal variation.</p>

		<p>Click on any value on the time series plot to highlight the residuals for 
      that month in each year. The average of these residuals is the seasonal 
      effect for that month.</p>
		<p>The plot of the seasonal effect at the bottom of the diagram clearly shows 
			the seasonal variation in temperatures.</p>
