<p class="heading">Statistical inference</p>

<p>The term <strong>statistical inference</strong> describes statistical
techniques that obtain information about a population parameter (or parameters) based on
a single random sample from that population. There are two different but related
types of question about the population parameter (or parameters) that we might ask:
</p>

<p class=heading>What parameter values would be consistent with the sample data?</p>

<p>This branch of inference is called <strong>estimation</strong> and its main 
tool is a confidence interval. We described confidence intervals in the previous 
chapter. </p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p>A biologist is studying broad-tailed hummingbirds (<em>Selasphorus platycerus</em>), 
a common bird in the western USA. Incubation times were recorded for 18 eggs from 
nests in mountain country above 8000 feet. These values are be modelled as a random 
sample from the hypothetical population of incubation times for this type of bird 
in the same area. </p>
<p>The sample mean (17.83 days) is a point estimate of the population mean, and 
a 95% confidence interval can also be found. </p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Are the sample data consistent with some statement about the parameters?</p>
<p>This branch of inference is called <strong>hypothesis testing</strong> and 
is the focus of this chapter. </p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p>It is known from much larger studies that the mean incubation time of eggs 
from broad-tailed hummingbirds in lower elevations is 16.5 days.</p>
<p>The biologist must assess whether the data are consistent with the statement 
(hypothesis) that the underlying population mean for birds in mountain country 
above 8000 feet is also 16.5 days. </p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Errors and strength of evidence</p>
<p>When we studied parameter estimation, we saw that a population parameter cannot 
be determined <strong>exactly</strong> from a single random sample &mdash; there is 
a 5% chance that a 95% confidence interval will <strong>not</strong> include the 
true population parameter. </p>

<p>In a similar way, a single random sample can rarely provide enough information 
about a population parameter to allow us to be sure whether or not any hypothesis 
about that parameter will be true. The best we can hope for is an indication of 
the <strong>strength of the evidence</strong> against the hypothesis. </p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter explains how this evidence is obtained and reported.</p>
