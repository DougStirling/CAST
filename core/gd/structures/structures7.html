<p class=heading>Exploratory data analysis</p>

  <p>The initial chapters of this e-book describe statistical  methods  to explore and 
		summarise a data set. Appropriate methods depend on the structure of the data set &mdash; the number 
	and types of its variables.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>One numerical variable</dt>
    <dd>Chapter 2 describes graphical and numerical summaries of a single numerical 
      variable.</dd>
    <dt>Two or more numerical variables</dt>
    <dd>Chapter 3 examines the relationship between two or more numerical variables.</dd>
    <dt>One ordered numerical variable</dt>
    <dd>In Chapter 4, we examine statistical methods for ordered data (time series).</dd>
    <dt>Categorical variables</dt>
    <dd>In Chapter 5, graphical and numerical methods are presented for categorical 
      variables. </dd>
    <dt>Many variables</dt>
    <dd>Chapter 6 is a brief chapter containing a few methods for data sets with 
      3 or more variables. </dd>
  </dl>
	
<p class=heading>Inference</p>
	
<p>To fully understand the information that is contained in most data sets, we must take account of randomness &mdash; if we collected the data again by repeating an experiment or collecting data from different people, the values would often be different. The relevant statistical methods are collectively called <strong>inference</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, the details of the statistical analysis depend mostly on the  structure of the data set &mdash; the number and types of its variables.</p>
<dl>
<dt>One variable</dt>
    <dd>Chapters 9 and 10 develop the methodology to answer questions about a 
      single numerical or categorical variable (confidence intervals and hypothesis 
      tests).</dd>
		<dt>Two or more groups</dt>
    <dd>Chapter 11 present confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare 
      two or more groups.</dd>
<dt>Two numerical variables</dt>
    <dd>Chapter 12 models the relationship between two numerical variables and gives 
      confidence and hypothesis tests about these models.</dd>
		<dt>Two categorical variables</dt>
		
    <dd>Chapter 13 describes methodology to compare groups of categorical data 
      or to examine the relationship between two categorical variables (contingency 
      tables).</dd>
</dl>
	
<p class=heading>Data collection</p>
	
  <p>Statisticians should be involved <strong>before</strong> any data are collected. 
    Statistical principles can be applied to the data collection process that 
    ensure that the resulting data can be meaningfully analysed. Chapters 7 and 
  8 explore the idea of random sampling and describe some principles that should be followed in data collection.</p>
