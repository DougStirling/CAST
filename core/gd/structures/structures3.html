<p class=heading>Categorical variables and groups</p>
	<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the individuals in a data set 
		into <strong>groups</strong>. For example, we might record the weight and 
		shell colour (white or brown) of 50 hens' eggs. We could use the 'shell colour' 
		variable to split the eggs into white eggs and brown eggs and separately list 
		the weights of the two groups.</p>
	<p>Conversely, if data were separately collected from different groups of individuals, 
		the resulting data sets could be combined with a categorical variable distinguishing 
		between the groups. For example, an experiment might be conducted to compare 
		the lifetimes of three brands of electric light bulb. The three sets of lifetimes 
		might be combined into a single data set with one numerical variable (the 
		lifetimes) and a categorical variable to distinguish the three brands. This 
		type of data set often arises from experiments.</p>

<p class="heading">Rice survey</p>

		<p>As part of a survey of rice producers in Sri Lanka, 36 farmers were randomly 
			selected from 4 villages. The yield of rice (tonnes per hectare) was determined 
			from each farmer.</p>

		<p class="heading">Days off work from illness</p>
		<p>The manager of a factory was concerned by the number of days that workers 
			took off work each year due to illness. Personnel records for 60 workers 
			were examined, and their sick days were recorded along with their age group, 
			<em>old</em> (defined as 40 or over) or <em>young</em> (under 40).</p>
