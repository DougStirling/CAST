<p class="heading">Is a relationship causal?</p>
<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change. For example, 
if the milk yield of cows is causally affected by a dietary supplement, then yields 
can be increased by changing this supplement. </p>
<table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="centred">
<tr> 
<td><strong>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
collected. </strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</p>
<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
  <p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables called <strong>lurking variables</strong> that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
  it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>

<p class="heading">Instruction in technical writing</p>
<p>In order to evaluate instruction in technical writing, a group of firms submit 
110 pieces of technical writing done by members of their staff who had received 
training in technical writing and another 120 piece of technical writing done 
by others who had no training. A panel of judges rated each article.</p>

<p>A larger proportion of those who had attended a course were rated as 'superior'. 
Also, a larger proportion of 'superior' passages were written by staff who had 
attended a course. </p>

<p>There are two possible interpretations of this relationship. </p>

<ul>
<li>Attending a course helps writing skills. <font color=black>If so, giving all 
staff a course on technical writing would improve quality.</font> <br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Writing skills affect attendance of a course. <font color=black>This would 
be true if only better writers had the confidence and interest to enrol in such 
courses. Or perhaps such courses are a compulsory part of business qualifications 
but not science qualifications.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>The data cannot help to resolve the issue of causation so it would be incorrect 
to report any causal relationship from these data.</p>
