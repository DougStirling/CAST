<p class="heading">Finding probabilities</p>

<p>We often need to find the probability that the sum or difference of two measurements will be within a particular range &mdash; for example, the probability that the difference between the heights of two randomly selected people is greater than 20&nbsp;cm.</p>
<p>If two random variables, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, have normal distributions with means µ<sub>1</sub> and µ<sub>2</sub> and standard deviations σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub>, their sum and difference are also normally distributed with mean and standard deviation given by the formulae</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../../en/sumDiff/images/meanSDDiff.gif" width="112" height="57"></p>

<p>To obtain probabilities relating to the sum or difference, any value
<em>x</em>
should first be translated into a z-score.</p>

<p>Probabilities relating to this z-score can be obtained from a standard normal distribution. The examples below illustrate the method.

<p class="heading">Example (total of several variables)</p>
<p>The following example shows how to find a probability relating to the <strong>total</strong> of the values in a random sample. (Note that the final step of finding the area under the standard normal density could be found from normal tables or on a computer.)</p>

<p class="heading">Example (sum of two variables with different sd)</p>
<p>The next example applies a similar method to a problem concerning the sum of two variables with different standard deviations.</p>

<p class="heading">Example (difference between two variables)</p>
<p>The final example involves the difference between two variables</p>
