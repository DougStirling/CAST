<p class="heading">Interpreting outliers or clusters</p>
	<p>We have described some information that may be read from a scatterplot. But
		how strong must the corrresponding patterns be before we should report them? </p>
	<p>In both univariate and bivariate data sets, outliers or clusters must be <strong> distinct</strong> before we should conclude that they are real,
		in the absence of further external information confirming that the
		individuals are distinct. </p>
<p>Particularly in small data sets, outliers, clusters and other patterns may arise <strong>by chance</strong>, without being associated with any real features in the
		individuals. </p>

<p>Be careful not to overinterpret features in scatterplot unless they 
				are well defined, especially if the sample size is small.</p>
