<p>The strength of the relationship between two variables is usually the most 
  important information that we gain from a scatterplot but a scatterplot may display other features.</p>
<p class="heading">Outliers</p>
<p>Values that seem 'different' from the rest of the data are called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
<p>An outlier may be an extreme value of one or other variable, but an individual
may be an outlier even though neither X nor Y is unusual on its own. One point
is an outlier in each of the three data sets below.</p>

<p>The point is an
outlier in the righthand data set  because it lies well above the main group
of points &mdash; its y-value is much higher than others with similar x-values.</p>
<p class=heading>Importance of outliers</p>
<p>Outliers are features of a data set that <strong>must</strong> be carefully 
	checked. An outlier is often caused by a recording or transcription error, 
	so...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>First check that the values of the variables 
			are correctly recorded.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes an outlier arises because an individual is fundamentally different 
	from the others.  Identifying what makes the individual different  often gives considerable insight into the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The individuals should be further examined (perhaps 
			collecting further information from them) to try to assess whether the 
			outlier individual has distinct characteristics.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An outlier that is either extreme or that has other distinctive characteristics 
	would often be deleted from the data set, but should be mentioned in a report 
	about the data.</p>
