<p class=heading>Causal relationships</p>
	<p>In many bivariate data sets, the relationship between the two variables is 
		not symmetric. From the nature of the variables and the way that the data were collected, it may be clear that one variable, X, can potentially influence the other, Y, but that the opposite is impossible.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../causal/images/reln1.gif" width="297" height="65"></p>
<p>In such data, the variable X is called the <strong>explanatory variable</strong> and Y is called the <strong>response</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading>Experiments</p>
	<p>In an experiment,  the person conducting the experiment controls the values
of the explanatory variable. A well-designed experiment
always ensures that the relationship between the explanatory variable and response
is causal.</p>
<p class=heading>Observational studies</p>
	<p>If the person collecting the data has no control over either of the variables,
and simply records a pair of values from each individual, then the data are called <strong>observational</strong>.
If one variable is an earlier measurement than the other, we may also
be able to treat it as an explanatory variable and the later variable as the
response. </p>
<p>Even if the relationship is not causal, we are sometimes interested in <strong>predicting</strong> the
value of one variable from the other. The variable being predicted would then
be treated as the response.</p>
