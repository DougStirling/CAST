<p class=heading>Contingency tables from univariate data in several groups</p>

<p>Contingency tables often arise from bivariate categorical data. However they 
can also arise from univariate categorical data that is recorded separately from 
several groups.</p>
<p>'Group membership' can be treated as a second categorical variable.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>Typhoid vaccines</p>
<p>The table below shows results from a trial of two vaccines for typhoid fever 
that were given to 6907 people in Nepal. Of these, 3,457 were given the vaccine 
<i>Vi capsular polysaccharide (Vi)</i> and 3,450 were given the vaccine <i>pneumococcus 
polysaccharide (Pneumo).</i> </p>

<div class="centred"><table class="centred" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
        <th align="CENTER">&nbsp;</th>
<th align="CENTER"><span class="blue">Vaccine Vi</span></th>

<p>In this example, two different groups of people were used in the experiment. 
The column variable  (distinguishing between the two vaccines) is not a random variable, as it is controlled by the experiment. A single categorical measurement (whether or not typhoid was contracted) was made 
from each person.</p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Comparing groups</p>

<p>Although the chi-squared test was motivated as a test of independence of two 
categorical variables, the <strong>same test</strong> can be used when each row 
(or column) of a contingency table corresponds to a separate group of individuals.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Null hypothesis (corresponding to independence)</dt>
<dd>The category probabilities are the same within each group.</dd>
<dt>Alternative hypothesis (corresponding to association)</dt>
<dd>The different groups have different probabilities.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test statistic and p-value are identical to those given earlier for testing independence.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class=heading>Examples</p>
<p>In the following examples, we test whether the 'response' proportions are the 
same in several groups.</p>

<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeImage('image', this)">
<option value="0" selected>Obesity and country</option>
<option value="1">IQ and season of birth</option>
<option value="2">Buffalo in Yellowstone Park</option>
<option value="3">Effect of typhoid vaccines</option>
</select>
</form>

<p class="eqn">
	<img class="gif" id="image" src="images/obeseTest.gif" width="541" height="459">
</p>

<p>Note again that a visual comparison of the observed counts and those estimated 
from the margins assuming independence helps to explain the nature of the relationship 
in examples where we conclude that there is some difference between the groups.</p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Two groups and two categories</p>

<p>In the special case where there are two groups and the categorical measurement 
has two categories (that we will call 'success' and 'failure'), the chi-squared 
test is testing whether the probability of success is the same in both groups. 
For example, in the Typhoid Vaccine data set, we are testing whether the probability 
of getting typhoid is the same for the groups getting the two vaccines.</p>
<p>This hypothesis can also be tested with a <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('twoGroupPropn4')">2-sample 
test of equality of two proportions</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, although the two tests have been motivated in a different way, 
it can be proved that:</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>The 2-sample test for equality of two proportions and 
the chi-squared test both result in the same p-value and conclusion.</p></div>
