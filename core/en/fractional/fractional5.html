<p class="heading">Experiments for factors with 3 levels</p>
  <p>Fractional factorial experiments can be designed with similar design principles for experiments in which the factors all have three levels.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Start with a complete factorial experiment for some of the factors.</li>
  	<li>Add extra factors that are confounded with interactions.</li>
 	</ul>
  <p>The details of the design are however different since each 2-factor interaction has <strong>four</strong> degrees of freedom though the main effects only have <strong>two</strong> degrees of freedom. As a result, main effects will be only confounded with <strong>part</strong> of an interaction term.</p>
  <p>It is best to rely on statistical software to design this type of experiment.</p>
  <p class="heading">Factors with mixed levels</p>
	<p>The design becomes even more complicated if different factors have different numbers of levels. Again, some main effects are confounded with interactions but an explanation is beyond the scope of this e-book.</p>
