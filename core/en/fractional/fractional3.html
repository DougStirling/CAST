<p class="heading">Designs based on complete factorial designs</p>  
  <p>In incomplete designs, some main effects are inevitably confounded with interactions. The best way to create such a design starts from a complete design &mdash; if there are 2<em><sup>k</sup></em> experimental units, this would be a complete design for <em>k</em> factors.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>The levels of the extra factors should be allocated based on the columns of +/-1 for interactions between the original factors.</p>
  </div></div>
  <p>There are often alternative possibilities here, but we would ideally prefer designs in which the main effects are only confounded 3-factor and higher-order interactions.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>A design that is obtained in this way for <em>k</em> factors in 2<em><sup>k</sup></em><sup>-<em>r</em></sup> experimental units is called a <strong>2<em><sup>k</sup></em><sup>-<em>r</em></sup> fractional factorial design</strong>.</p>
 	</div></div>
  <p class="heading">Confounding</p>
  <p>In fractional factorial experiments, many interactions are confounded, not just the interactions that define the 'extra' factors. For example, consider a 2<sup>3</sup> factorial design for factors A, B and C in which the levels of D are defined by the 3-factor interaction between the three original factors,</p>
  <p class="eqn">D&nbsp; = &nbsp; ABC</p>
	<p>Several other effects are confounded in this design. They can be found using 
		arithmetic on the columns of Â±1, noting that squaring any column gives 
		+1, </p>
	<p class="eqn">A<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; = &nbsp; B<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; = &nbsp; C<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; 
    = &nbsp; D<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; = &nbsp; 1</p>
  <p>Therefore</p>
  <p class="eqn">A &nbsp; = &nbsp; AD<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; = &nbsp; (AD)D &nbsp; 
    = &nbsp; (AD)(ABC) &nbsp; = &nbsp; A<sup>2</sup>BCD &nbsp; = &nbsp; BCD</p>
  <p>and similarly,</p>
  <p class="eqn">B&nbsp; = &nbsp; ACD</p>
  <p class="eqn">C&nbsp; = &nbsp; ABD</p>
  <p class="eqn">AB&nbsp; = &nbsp; CD</p>
  <p class="eqn">AC&nbsp; = &nbsp; BD</p>
  <p class="eqn">AD&nbsp; = &nbsp; BC</p>
  <p class="eqn">ABCD&nbsp; = &nbsp; 1</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">2<sup>4-1</sup> fractional factorial design</p>
<p>The columns on the left below show the levels for a complete 2<sup>3</sup> factorial design for factors A, B and C. We now consider varying a fourth factor, D, in this experiment..</p>

<div class="centred"> 
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="350" height="390">

<p>In the diagram above, it is possible to decide which of the interactions will be confounded with factor D in the design by clicking the red heading above the table. Observe that:</p>
<ul><li>If D is confounded with the ABC interaction, <strong>none</strong> of the main effects are confounded with 2-factor interactions.</li>
	<li>If D is confounded with the ABC interaction, our assessment of the relative effects of the four factors is not affected by 2-factor interactions between them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If  D is confounded with any of the 2-factor interactions, the apparent sizes of three of the main effects might be caused by 2-factor interactions between other factors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it is more reasonable to assume that there are no 3-factor interactions,</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The best design uses the column of +/-1 for the ABC interaction to define the levels of factor D.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Another way to describe the treatments</p>
<p>The treatments that are used in the design are displayed in a different way under the table &mdash; each 'word' describes the factors that are at their 'high' level for one of the experimental units. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;cd&quot; means that factors C and D are at their high level and A and B are at their low level for one experimental unit.</li>
	<li>&quot;a&quot; means that only factor A is at its high level and the others are at their low level for one experimental unit.</li>
	<li>&quot;(1)&quot; means that all factors are at their low level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on rows of the table or 'words' under it to see how the 'words' correspond to the levels of the factors.</p>
