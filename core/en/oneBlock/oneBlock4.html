  	<p>The importance of grouping experimental units into blocks and allocating treatments in a randomised block design cannot be overemphasised. </p>
  </div></div>
  <p class="heading">Another illustration of the benefits from using blocks</p>
  <p>The example below arises from a randomised block experiment with:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>one control treatment against which we want to compare the other treatments</li>
  	<li>a single replicate for each treatment per block</li>
 	</ul>
  <p>For each comparison of a treatment to the control, the data are a paired sample of the form that was analysed in the previous section. In particular, we can calculate the difference between the treatment and control within each block and find a 95% confidence interval for the difference.</p>
  <p>If the experiment had been conducted as a completely randomised experiment, we would have simply had two independent samples to use for each comparison &mdash; the set of response measurements for the control and those for the treatment that we are comparing to it. A two-sample 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means would be appropriate.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>In the example, we show that the confidence intervals are much narrower when using paired differences, supporting our claim that the randomised block design is more accurate.</p>

		<p class="heading">Codeine and acupuncture for dental pain relief</p>
  	<p>In a randomised block experiment, 32 subjects were grouped into blocks 
  		of four according to an initial assessment of their tolerance to pain. Four 
  		pain relief treatments were randomly allocated to the four patients in each 
  		group and pain relief scores were recorded from each subject two hours after 
  		dental treatment.</p>
