<p class="heading">Bernoulli trial</p>

<p>We now concentrate on a single event in a random situation. Either the event happens, which we call a &quot;success&quot; or it does not happen, a &quot;failure&quot;. These words are simply intended to provide a general terminology that can be applied to <strong>any</strong> kind of event and there should be no positive connotation to a &quot;success&quot;. When dealing with the survival of a cancer patient two years after chemotherapy, we might denote either death <strong>or</strong> survival as &quot;success&quot;.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Examples of "successes"</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The next child born in a hospital maternity unit is male.</li>
		<li>A randomly inspected item in a production line is defective.</li>
		<li>A student gets the correct answer when guessing in a multi-choice question with five options.</li>
		<li>A beetle dies when given a low dose of insecticide.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<p>A random experiment such as this with only two possible outcomes is called a<strong> Bernoulli trial</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Bernoulli distribution</p>

<p>It is useful to define a <strong>numerical</strong> variable based on one such event. This has the value one when the event happens and zero when it does not happen.</p>
<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
	<p>If there is an event \(A\) for which \(P(A) = \pi\), and a random variable \(X\) is defined by</p>
 \[
X = \begin {cases}
	1 &amp; \quad \text{if  } A \text{ occurs (a success)}\\[0.5em]
	0 &amp; \quad \text{if } A \text{ does not occur (a failure)}
\end {cases}
\]

	<p>then \(X\) has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter \(\pi\),</p>

\[
X \;\; \sim \; \; \BernoulliDistn(\pi)
\]

</div>
<p>From this definition, \(X\) is a discrete random variable with the following probability function:</p>
\[
p(x) = \begin {cases}
	\pi &amp; \quad \text{if  } x = 1\\[0.5em]
	(1 - \pi) &amp; \quad \text{if } x = 0\\[0.5em]
	0 &amp; \quad \text{otherwise}
\end {cases}
\]

	<p class="heading">Sequence of Bernoulli trials</p>
<p>Although a single Bernoulli trial is too simple to be of much practical importance, situations often arise that can be treated as  sequences of independent Bernoulli trials, all of which have the same probability of success. Later sections of this chapter describe  distributions related to a sequence of Bernoulli trials.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Examples</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Genders of successive children born in a hospital's maternity unit.</li>
		<li>Results from testing whether several randomly inspected items in a production line are defective.</li>
		<li>Whether the answers that a student gives are correct in a sequence of multi-choice questions with five options, if the student is only guessing.</li>
		<li>Survival of several beetles  when given a low dose of insecticide.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
