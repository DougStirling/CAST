	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
	<p>A <strong>discrete random variable</strong> is a function that gives a numerical value for each outcome in a sample space and whose possible values are either finite or countably infinite.</p>
</div>
<p>In many applications, it is possible to use a simpler definition that retains the essential features of discrete random variables.</p>
<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Simpler (but less general) description</p>
	<p>An experiment whose outcomes are numerical and whose sample space is either finite or countably infinite can be treated as a <strong>discrete random variable</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>For most discrete random variables, the outcomes are <strong>whole numbers</strong> — <strong>counts</strong> of something, but the definition also includes situations where the values are not integers. For example,  the <strong>proportion</strong> of successes in 10 repetitions of a simple experiment is also  a discrete random variable — its possible values are {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 1.0}.</p>
<p class="heading">Probability function</p>
<p>A discrete random variable's distribution is fully described by its <strong>probability function</strong>,</p>

\[
P(\text{outcome } x) \;\;=\;\; P(X=x) \;\;=\;\; p(x)
\]


<p>This may be described by a table of probabilities (if there is a finite number of possible outcomes) but is more often described by a mathematical formula.</p>
<p>From the probability function, we can find the probability of any other event relating to the random variable. For any event, \(A\),</p>

\[
P(A) = \sum_{x \in A} p(x)
\]

		<p class="questionTitle">Question: Girls in a family</p>
		<p>A couple want at least two children and no more than four. However, subject to this constraint on their total number of children, they will stop when they get a boy.</p>
		<p>Assuming that  there are no multiple births and the probability of any child being male is \(\frac 1 2\), independent of the genders of previous children, what is the probability function for the number of girls in the family?</p>

<p>In order to be a probability function, a function \(p(x)\) must satisfy a few properties:</p>
