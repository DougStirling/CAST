<p class="heading">Quantities and zeros</p>
<p>Most tables contain values that are <strong>quantities</strong> &mdash; values in 
which zero has special meaning. Ideally, when a bar chart is used to represent 
the data, the bars should all extend up from zero, so that the amount of ink on 
the paper is proportional to the quantity.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Bar lengths should be proportional to the values.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some data sets contain values that are very close together and all bars would 
visually seem to be the same if a bar chart was drawn properly. There is then 
no alternative but to violate this principle in order to graphically represent 
the data. A bar chart can be drawn to a scale that starts at a value higher than 
zero, but it is important to clearly <strong>indicate that the scale no longer 
starts at zero with zig-zags</strong> at the bottom of the axis and/or bars. </p>

<p class="heading">Life expectancy in Western Europe</p>
		
<p>The bar chart below shows life expectancies for males in some of the larger 
countries in Western Europe in 2003.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="500" height="450">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="graphicsProg.BarNoZeroApplet">
<param name="varName" value="Male life expectancy">
<param name="values" value="77.31 77.11 76.47 76.32 75.87 75.74 75.63 75.46 74.58 74.10">

</applet>
</div>

<p>Since all values are between 74 and 78, the bars all have similar heights and 
the bar chart does not effectively show differences between the countries. Click 
<strong>Expand scale</strong> to change the vertical scale so that it starts at 
70 instead of zero.</p>
<p>The resulting scale distinguishes the countries better, but note the use of 
zig-zags at the bottom of the bars to highlight the fact that they no longer start 
at zero.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Negative values</p>
<p>Some data sets describe quantities that can be negative. In particular, many 
demographic and economic statistics can increase or decrease from year to year, 
so their changes can take either sign.</p>
<p>Such quantities can be represented on a bar chart with bars extending on both 
sides of zero. It is best to use a different colour or shading for the bars representing 
the negative values so that the negative values stand out.</p>

<p class="heading">Projected population changes in New Zealand</p>

<p>The next bar chart shows projected regional population changes in the period 
2001-2026. The population is projected to decrease in some regions, so their bars 
ard drawn to the left of zero.</p>
