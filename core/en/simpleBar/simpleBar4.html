<p>If a categorical data set has only a few distinct categories, the information in 
it can be very simply expressed. For example, consider the gender of each student 
in a class of 160. The bar chart on the right only shows that there were 100 males, 
62.5% of the class.</p>

<p>Since the information contained in a bar chart is often simple (only 2 values 
above), it is tempting to embellish bar charts 'artistically' to make them more 
visually appealing. These additions are collectively called <strong>chartjunk</strong>. 
Many spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel, make it easy to add chartjunk to bar 
charts.</p>
<p>In general, chartjunk should be avoided &mdash; it is usually easier to read information 
from a standard bar chart. Rather than adding chartjunk, draw the bar chart small 
or  replace it with a frequency table.</p>

<p class="heading">Three-dimensional chartjunk</p>
<p>A common form of chartjunk is obtained by changing each bar into a 3-dimensional 
object. When the resulting 3-dimensional picture is rotated, it often becomes 
harder to compare the heights of bars and to read off values from the axes. In 
particular, perspective views should be avoided.</p>

<p class="heading">Hawaii visitor arrivals in 2012</p>

<p>The diagram below was produced by Microsoft Excel to show the origin of all 
visitors to Hawaii in 2012.</p>

<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="../univarCat/images/hawaii3DBars.gif" width="454" height="328"> 
</div>
<p>Although this display is more visually appealing than the original barchart, 
it is now harder to assess whether the visitor numbers from Japan were just over 
or under 1.5 million.</p>
<p>Although the above barchart is still acceptable, the extra rotation and perspective 
viewpoint of the diagram below make it an extremely poor representation of the 
data. </p>
