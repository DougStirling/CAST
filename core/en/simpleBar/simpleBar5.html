<p class="heading">Replacing bars with objects</p>

<p>A second type of chartjunk is obtained by replacing the rectangular bars in 
a barchart with pictures of objects. This a much more serious problem since it 
often visually mis-represents the proportions in the different categories. Are 
the values proportional to the heights of the objects, their areas on the paper 
or their 3-dimensional volumes? At a quick glance, most readers would use something 
between area and volume though it is usually the heights of the bars that actually 
determine the size of the objects in this type of diagram.</p>

<p class="heading">Recreational participation in New Zealand</p>

<p>The diagram below was published to show the percentage of men and women participating 
in various recreational activities in 1996,</p>
<div class="centred"><img src="images/recParticipation.gif" width="460" height="282"> 
    </div>
<p>Again, the visual impression is misleading because the widths of the carrots 
also change. In particular, the employees getting under 5% merit increase seem 
visually unimportant, but they comprise nearly 10% of the total employees.</p>

<p class="heading">If you are determined to use pictures...</p>

<p>Pictures in bar charts are really chartjunk and should be avoided &mdash; they do 
not make the information in the data clearer and have the potential to mislead. 
However if you are <strong>determined</strong> to use them, it is much less misleading 
to use stacks of pictures that are all of the same size.</p>

<p class="heading">Example</p>

<p>The bar chart below might be used to represent some aspect of car ownership 
or accidents.</p>
<div class="centred"><img src="images/carIconBars.gif" width="312" height="247"> 
</div>
<p>Simple bars would be clearer, but the 'ink' used in each stack of cars is roughly 
proportional to the group's value, so the diagram does not badly mislead.</p>
