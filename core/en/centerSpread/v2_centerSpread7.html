	<p>Students usually find the standard deviation a difficult concept because
of its formula. Luckily, understanding its definition is much less important
than  having a feel for what its numerical value means. </p>
<p class="heading">Standard deviation and histogram</p>
	
	<p>From any histogram, you should be able to make a rough guess at the value
of the standard deviation.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'centerSpread', 'guessSd', '334', '162');</script>

<p>Similarly, given the mean and standard deviation for a data set, you should
be able to draw a rough sketch of a symmetric histogram with that mean and standard
deviation.</p>

		<p>In later chapters of CAST, you will meet statistical methods that allow 
      you to properly compare two groups such as these, but we mention here that 
      these methods will be based on the group means and standard deviations.</p>
