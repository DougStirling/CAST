<p class="heading">Centre and spread</p>
  
<p>Two important aspects of a distribution are its centre and spread. The exercise 
below asks for the difference between two data sets to be characterised in terms 
of differences between their centres and spreads.</p>
	
<div class="diagram">
<p>The exercise below describes two data sets that should be exported and examined graphically
in a statistical program. You should then characterise 
the difference between the centres of the distributions using the radio buttons 
on the left and <strong>also</strong> using the pop-up menu below them. Similarly 
characterise the difference between the spreads of the two data sets on the right. 
(Note that a total of <strong>four</strong> responses are required.)</p>

<div class="centred">
<script type="text/javascript">outputExercise("exerciseSDProg.CenterSpreadApplet", "widgetsExternal,potatoesExternal", "externalAnalysis", document);</script>
</div>

<p>The next exercise is similar, but exports the data in stacked format â€” with all numerical measurements
in one column and a factor distinguishing between groups.</p>

<div class="centred">
<script type="text/javascript">outputExercise("exerciseSDProg.CenterSpreadApplet", "widgetsExternal,potatoesExternal", "externalAnalysis, stacked", document);</script>
</div>
		
<p>Repeat a few times.</p>
