<p>The diagram can be used to explain the importance of centre and spread.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low/high centre for Employee X means that the ropes tend to be too short/long</li>
  <li>Low/high spread for Employee X means less/more accuracy in the lengths</li>
</ul>
<p>After demonstrating with the sliders using application-specific terms, click the <strong>Generic wording</strong> checkbox then explain that the concepts correspond to the centre and spread of the distribution.</p>

<p>The context is a  pharmaceutical company that is in the final stages of testing a new drug that is effective at reducing high blood pressure. Some patients have however reported side effects &mdash; in particular some felt that their perception of distance had been affected.</p>
<p>An experiment  was conducted to measure whether the ability to assess distance was worse for patients receiving the drug. A 'control' group of 20 male patients were not given any drug and another group of 20 was given the new drug. Each subject was asked to position himself 3 metres from a wall and the actual distance was recorded.</p>
