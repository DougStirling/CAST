<p class="heading">'Quarter-range' rule of thumb</p>
	<p>For many data sets, the standard deviation is just under 
		a quarter of the range.</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><img class="gif" src="images/deviations2.gif" width="454" height="158"></td>
	</tr>
</table></div>

	<p>This is a simple rule, but is only very approximate. The standard deviation 
		can be more than a quarter the range in distributions with short tails or 
		much less if there are long tails or outliers.</p>
	<p class="heading">The 70-95-100 rule of thumb</p>
	<p>The <strong>70-95-100 rule</strong> is more accurate. In many distributions, </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Approximately 70% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
		<li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
		<li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule holds approximately for most reasonably symmetric data 
		sets, but for skew data or distributions with long tails, outliers or clusters, it is often less accurate.</p>
