<p class="heading">Simple measures of spread</p>
	<p>The range and inter-quartile range are summaries of the spread of values in a  data set that are (relatively) easy to understand and to explain to others.</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>Range</dt>
	  <dd>Difference between maximum and minimum values</dd>
	  <dt>Inter-quartile range</dt>
	  <dd>The middle half of the values are within an interval of this length</dd>
	</dl>
  <p>However for several reasons, some of which will be explained later in this e-book, neither of these values is commonly used either as a summary of spread  in reports or for further data analysis.</p>
	<p class="heading">Standard deviation</p>
	<p>The value that is most often used to summarise the spread of values in a data set is its <strong>standard deviation</strong>.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>The standard deviation is a 'typical' distance of values from the sample mean.</p></div>

	<p>The diagram below illustrates.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/deviations.gif" width="434" height="166"> </p>
	<p>Unfortunately the exact formula for the standard deviation is relatively complex:</p>
	
<div class="boxed percent50"><p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../../en/centerSpread/images/sdDefn.gif" width="115" height="52"></p></div>

	<p>The  standard deviation of a data set is denoted by the letter <span class="black em">s</span>  and will be widely used in later chapters.</p>
	<p class="heading">Brief explanation</p>
	<p>It is easier to explain the properties of the standard deviation than to justify its precise formula.  However note that the term,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/ssqDevns.gif" width="70" height="26"> </p>
	<p>in the formula depends on the squared differences between the individual values and the sample mean. The closer the values to the mean (corresponding to a small spread), the smaller this sum and therefore the smaller the standard deviation.</p>
	
<div class="boxed"><p>The standard deviation is  small when the spread of values is small and large when the spread of values is large, so it works as a summary of spread.</p></div>
  
<p class="heading">Variance</p>
	<p>The square of the standard deviation, <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, is called the sample <strong>variance</strong> and is sometimes used as an alternative description of spread. However the value of <em>s</em> has the same units as the original data (e.g. kilograms or dollars) so is more easily interpreted than <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, and standard deviations are usually prefered to summarise spread.</p>

		<p>Click on crosses to see the difference between the values and the mean. The standard deviation is 'typical' of the magnitude of these differences.</p>

    <p>Use the slider to adjust the spread of values and observe that the standard deviation is  small when the values are all close to their mean and large when they are more variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:30px;"><em>(Warning: The x-values displayed in the table above are rounded
to 2 decimals, but the squared differences and the standard deviation are calculated
from  the exact x-values, so they do not match exactly with what
you would calculate by hand.)
