<p class="heading">Variation in commonly known measurements</p>
<p>There is variability between 'individuals' in most types of measurement. Your 
general knowledge about variation in many measurements should allow you to make 
very rough guesses at the likely standard deviation.</p>
<p>(Such a 'guess' can sometimes highlight an error in more formal calculations.)</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p>In the following exercise, only a very rough guess at the value of the standard 
deviation is required. (Most questions allow you to be out by a factor of two 
or more.) </p>

<div class="centred">
<script type="text/javascript">outputExercise("exerciseSDProg.GuessSDPhotoApplet", null, null, document);</script>
</div>

<p>Try for several different types of measurement.</p>
