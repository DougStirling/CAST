<p class="heading">Centre and spread</p>
  
<p>Two important aspects of a distribution are its centre and spread. The exercise 
below asks for the difference between two data sets to be characterised in terms 
of differences between their centres and spreads.</p>
<div class="diagram">
<p>The diagram below shows two data sets as stacked dot plots. You should characterise 
the difference between the centres of the distributions using the radio buttons 
on the left and <strong>also</strong> using the pop-up menu below them. Similarly 
characterise the difference between the spreads of the two data sets on the right. 
(Note that a total of <strong>four</strong> responses are required.)</p>
