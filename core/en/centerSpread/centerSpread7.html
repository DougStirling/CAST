<p class="heading">Standard deviation and histogram</p>
	<p>Students usually find the standard deviation a difficult concept. Luckily, understanding its
    definition is much less important than knowing its properties and having a feel
    for what its numerical value means. </p>
  <p>If you have understood the 70-95-100 rule, you should be able to make a fairly 
    accurate guess at the standard deviation of a batch of values from a histogram 
    or dot plot (without doing any calculations). About 95% of the values should 
    be within 2 standard deviations of the mean, so after dropping the top 2.5% 
    and bottom 2.5% of the crosses (or area of the histogram), the remainder should 
    span approximately 4 standard deviations. So dividing this range by 4 should 
    approximate the standard deviation.</p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/guessSD.gif" width="288" height="154"> </p>
  <p>Similarly, given the mean and standard deviation for a data set, you should 
    be able to draw a rough sketch of a symmetric histogram with that mean and 
    standard deviation. (It would be centred on the mean and 95% of the area would 
    be within 2 standard deviations of this.)</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Exercise capacity of the elderly">
	<p class=heading>Exercise capacity of the elderly</p>
	<p>The table below was published in the <em>Official Journal of the 
		American College of Sports Medicine</em>. The table describes 'anthropometric data and maximal exercises capacity' of 
		two groups of elderly men &mdash; 10 who continued to do regular exercise (athletes) and another 12 who had not continued 
		with exercise into old age (controls). All values are printed in the form 
		(mean ± standard deviation).</p>

<p class=heading>Guessed histograms</p>
<p>Using the 70-95-100 rule of thumb, we can sketch a rough histogram to match each mean and standard deviation &mdash; about 70% of each histogram's area should be within s of the mean, 95% within 2s of the mean and about all within 3s. These can be used to compare the 'Athletes' and 'Controls' for any variable.</p>

		<p>Use the pop-up menu to investigate the differences between the athletes and controls for the different variables.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>The actual histograms may not be symmetric and would certainly be more 'boxy' than those above, but this is the best we can do from the available information.</p></div>

		<p class=heading>A few interpretations...</p>
		<p>The data set is small, but from the means and standard deviations, we can 
			either use the approximate histograms or use the 70-95-100 rule directly to infer that...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Approximately 70% of the athletes have heights between 1.73 and 1.85 
				metres, whereas about 70% of the controls are between 1.69 and 1.81. There 
				is considerable overlap in these distributions.</li>
			<li>Approximately 70% of the athletes have Max VO<sub>2</sub> between 2.39 
				and 3.43 litres, whereas about 70% of the controls are between 1.81 and 
				2.39 litres. These distributions overlap less, suggesting that there may 
				be a more important difference in oxygen uptake between the groups.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In later chapters of CAST, you will meet statistical methods that allow 
      you to properly compare two groups such as these, but we mention here that 
      these methods will be based on the group means and standard deviations.</p>
