<p>Although both describe aspects of the 'centre' of a distribution, the median and mean are 
		not the same and can occasionally have very different values.</p>
	<p class=heading>Social vs economic indicator</p>
	<p>For some data sets, <strong>the median can be considered to be a social indicator,
		whereas the mean can be interpreted as an economic indicator</strong>. In a company,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the median salary indicates what the 'average employee' earns
			(half of the employees earn more and half earn less)</li>
		<li>the mean salary reflects the total amount paid as salaries in the company
			(it is <em>total</em>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<em>n</em>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Outliers</p>
	<p>An outlier has little effect on the  median,
		but affects the mean more strongly. The median is
		said to be more <strong>robust</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Skew distributions</p>
	<p>When a distribution  is fairly symmetrical, the mean and median
		are similar, but if the distribution is skew, then the mean is usually further
into the tail of the distribution than the median.</p>
