<p class="heading">Simple summaries of centre and spread</p>
  
<p>The simplest summary statistics that describe centre and spread are based 
  on the five-number summary (and box plot).</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Centre</dt>
  <dd>The <strong>median</strong> is the simplest measure of centre. Half the 
    data are more than it, and half less.</dd>
  <dt>Spread</dt>
  <dd>The <strong>range</strong> (maximum - minimum) and <strong>interquartile 
    range</strong> (upper quartile - lower quartile) are two different summary 
    statistics that describe the spread of values in a data set.<br>&nbsp;</dd>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Distance perception">
<p class="heading">Distance perception (side-effect of drug)</p>
<p>The diagram below describes a similar context to the examples on the previous page.
An experiment is conducted with a control group of 30 subjects (who get no drug) and another group of 30 subjects who
are given a new drug whose side-effects may affect distance perception.</p>
<p>Each subject is told to stand 3 metres from a wall and the actual distance from the wall is exactly measured. </p>

<p>Use the two sliders to adjust the centre and spread of distances for those getting the new drug.</p>
<p>Observe that the differences between the medians and inter-quartile ranges of the two drugs concisely summarise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whether the new drug tends to make subjects stand closer or farther from the wall. (Subjects in the control group have a median distance that is close to 3 metres.)</li>
  <li>Whether the drug makes subjects judge distance more consistently (i.e. less variable distances) or less consistently (i.e. more variable distances) than those in the control group.</li>
</ul>

<p class=heading>Usefulness of summary statistics</p>

  <p>Although a single measure of centre and one of spread provide only limited 
    information about the shape of a distribution of values, they do often give 
    a suprisingly accurate impression of the distribution.</p>
  <p>Given the median and interquartile range, it is possible to sketch a bell-shaped 
    histogram that matches these values. Such a 'guess' is often close to the 
    actual distribution of values.</p>
