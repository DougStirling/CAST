<p>Understanding the
		definition of the standard deviation is much less important than knowing
its properties and having a feel for what its numerical value tells you about
the data. </p>
	<p class="heading">Guessing <em>s</em> from histogram</p>
<p>About 95% of the values should 
		be within 2<em>s</em> of the mean, so after dropping the top 2.5% 
		and bottom 2.5% of the values (histogram area), the remainder should 
		span approximately 4<em>s</em>. Dividing this range by 4 should 
		approximate the standard deviation.</p>

	<p class="heading">Sketching a histogram from the mean and <em>s</em></p>
<p>Similarly, you should 
		be able to draw a rough sketch of a symmetric histogram with any mean and
standard deviation that you are given. (It would be centred on the mean and 95%
of the area would be within 2<em>s</em> of this.)</p>
