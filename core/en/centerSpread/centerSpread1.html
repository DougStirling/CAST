<p class="heading">Summarising centre and spread</p>

  <p>Most data sets exhibit variability &mdash; all values are not the same!
Two aspects of the distribution of values are particularly important.</p>
	
<dl>
		<dt>Centre</dt>
		<dd>The centre of a distribution is a 'typical' value around which the data 
			are located.</dd>
		<dt>Spread</dt>
		<dd>The spread of a distribution of values describes the distance of the individual 
      values from the centre.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/centerSpreadIdea.gif" width="325" height="109"> 
	</p>
	<p>In this section, we examine how to describe centre and spread with numerical 
		values called <strong>summary statistics</strong>. Numerical summaries of 
		centre and spread give particularly concise and meaningful comparisons of 
		different groups.</p>
	<div class="diagram">

		<p>Three workers in a tent factory cut guy ropes by hand in lengths of 2 metres. 
			The diagram below shows how the actual lengths of 20 guy ropes cut by each 
			employee differ from the target lengths.</p>
		
<table width="95%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
				<td align="center"><img class="gif" src="images/differentCentres.gif" width="255" height="350"></td>
				<td align="left"> 
					<p>There is considerable variation in the lengths of the ropes cut by 
						the three employees &mdash; they can be up to 20 mm off their target.</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The centre of Employee A's distribution is close to zero &mdash; the ropes 
						are typically about the right length.</li>
					<li>Employee B tends to cut the guy ropes too short. The centre of Employee 
						B's distribution is about -10mm.</li>
					<li>Employee C tends to cut the ropes too long. The centre of the distribution 
						is close to 10mm.</li>
					</ul>
					</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>A numerical measure of centre should describe this tendency for employees 
			to over- or under-cut the ropes.</p>
			
		<hr width="75%">

		<p>A different group of three workers was given the same task in order to assess whether
		they could cut the ropes more accurately.</p>
		<table width="95%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
			<tr>
				<td align="center"><img class="gif" src="images/differentSpreads.gif" width="255" height="350"></td>
				<td align="left"> 
					<p>None of these three workers tends to cut the ropes too long or too 
						short &mdash; the centres of all three distributions are close to zero. 
						However </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Employee D is the most consistent. The ropes are generally within 
							5mm of the target length.</li>
						<li>Employee F is the least consistent &mdash; the ropes can be up to 20mm 
							out. </li>
					</ul>
					</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>A numerical measure of spread should describe how consistently the 
			workers can cut the ropes to length.</p>
