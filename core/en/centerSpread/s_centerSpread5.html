<p class="heading">Simple measures of spread</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Range</dt>
		<dd>Difference between maximum and minimum values</dd>
		<dt>Inter-quartile range</dt>
		<dd>The middle half of the values are within an interval of this length</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>These are (relatively) easy to understand and explain to others, but neither are commonly used.</p>
	<p class="heading">Standard deviation</p>
	<p>The standard deviation is a 'typical' distance of values from the sample mean.</p>

	<p>The  standard deviation  is denoted by the letter <span class="black em">s</span>  and
is defined by:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/sdDefn.gif" width="115" height="52"></p>
	<p>The numerator, <span class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/ssqDevns.gif" width="70" height="26"></span>, depends on the distances of the values to the mean, so it will be small if the values are all close to the mean and big if they are far from the mean.</p>
	<p class="heading">Variance</p>
	<p>The square of the standard deviation, <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, is called the
sample <strong>variance</strong>. Variances are sometimes reported and used but
standard deviations are easier to interpret since they have  the same units as
the original data (e.g. kilograms or dollars).</p>
