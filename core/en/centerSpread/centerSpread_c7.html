<p class="heading">Standard deviation and histogram</p>
	<p>Students usually find the standard deviation a difficult concept. Luckily, understanding its
    definition is much less important than knowing its properties and having a feel
    for what its numerical value means. </p>
  <p>If you have understood the 70-95-100 rule, you should be able to make a fairly 
    accurate guess at the standard deviation of a batch of values from a histogram 
    or dot plot (without doing any calculations). About 95% of the values should 
    be within 2 standard deviations of the mean, so after dropping the top 2.5% 
    and bottom 2.5% of the crosses (or area of the histogram), the remainder should 
    span approximately 4 standard deviations. So dividing this range by 4 should 
    approximate the standard deviation.</p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/guessSD.gif" width="288" height="154"> </p>
  <p>Similarly, given the mean and standard deviation for a data set, you should 
    be able to draw a rough sketch of a symmetric histogram with that mean and 
    standard deviation. (It would be centred on the mean and 95% of the area would 
    be within 2 standard deviations of this.)</p>

	<p class=heading>Retail Store Merchandise Buyers</p>
	<p>The table below was published in the Journal of Retailing. It describes 
	  the results from questionnaires completed by 'merchandise buyers' in 213 
	  chain stores &mdash; the people responsible for purchasing stock that will be 
	  sold by the retailers. The buyers were classified into two groups, depending 
	  on whether they were still in the same employment after 9 months, and a 
	  major aim of the study was to compare these 'stayers' and 'leavers'.</p>

	<p>The table summarises the main differences between the groups. (We refer 
	  to the paper for details of the measurements &mdash; most were obtained by aggregating 
	  the responses to a group of questions in the questionnaire.)</p>

	  and Non-Chain Retail Store Buyers, S.M.Keaveney, Journal of Retailing, 68,

	<p class=heading>Guessed histograms</p>
<p>Using the 70-95-100 rule of thumb, we can sketch a rough histogram to match each mean and standard deviation &mdash; about 70% of each histogram's area should be within s of the mean, 95% within 2s of the mean and about all within 3s. These can be used to compare the 'Stayers' and 'Buyers' for any variable.</p>

		<p>Use the pop-up menu to investigate the differences between the Stayers and Buyers for the different variables.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>The actual histograms may not be symmetric and would certainly be more 'boxy' than those above, but this is the best we can do from the available information.</p></div>

   
		<p class=heading>Interpretation...</p>
		<p>From the means and standard deviations, we can 
			either use the approximate histograms (as sketched above) or use the 70-95-100 rule directly to infer that there is considerable overlap between the distributions for Stayers and Buyers for all variables. For example,</p>
		<ul><li>Approximately 70% of the stayers had 'intention to leave' between 5.3 
          and 12.5, whereas about 70% of the leavers were between 6.8 and 15.7. 
          There is considerable overlap in these distributions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In later chapters of CAST, you will meet statistical methods that allow 
      you to properly compare two groups such as these, but we mention here that 
      these methods will be based on the group means and standard deviations.</p>
