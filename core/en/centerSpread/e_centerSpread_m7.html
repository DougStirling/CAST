<p class="heading">Interpreting the standard deviation</p>
  <p>The mean and standard deviation of a variable summarise important aspects 
		of its distribution &mdash; its centre and spread. It is relatively easy to interpret 
		the value of a variable's mean (its point of balance), but the formula for 
		the standard deviation is more complex so it is harder to 'understand' what 
		its numerical value tells you about the distribution. Luckily, understanding 
		its definition is much less important than knowing its properties and having 
		a feel for what its numerical value means.</p>
	<p class=heading>Guessing the standard deviation from a histogram or box plot</p>
	<p>If you have understood the 70-95-100 rule, you should be able to make a fairly 
		accurate guess at the standard deviation of a batch of values from a histogram, 
		dot plot or box plot (without doing any calculations). About 95% of the values 
		should be within 2 standard deviations of the mean, so after dropping the 
		top 2.5% and bottom 2.5% of the crosses (or area of the histogram), the remainder 
		should span approximately 4 standard deviations. So dividing this range by 
		4 should approximate the standard deviation.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/guessSD.gif" width="288" height="154"> </p>
	<p>In a similar way, about 70% of the values should be within 1 standard deviation 
		of the mean. The central box of a box plot includes 50% of the values, so 
		the length of the central box should be a bit under 2 standard deviations.</p>
	<p>If a quarter of the range is much different from a bit more than half the 
		width of the central box in a box plot (or middle 50% of the histogram area), 
		you could average these two estimates of <em>s</em>.</p>

		<p class="heading">Estimating the standard deviation 'by eye'</p>
		<p>Although you cannot accurately evaluate the standard deviation of a data 
			set without access to the raw data, it should be possible to obtain a rough 
			estimate by looking at a graphical summary of the data. In the exercises 
			below, you should estimate the standard deviation from a histogram or box 
			plot of a data set.</p>

</div>

		<p>Use the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb to estimate the standard deviation from 
			the histogram, then type your guess into the Answer box and click <strong>Check</strong>.</p>
		<p>Most of a data set are usually within 2 standard deviations of the mean 
			unless the distribution is very skew, so a good guess is usually a quarter 
			of the range (max - min).</p>
		<p>Click <strong>Another Question</strong> and repeat until you can obtain 
			a reasonable estimate consistently.</p>
