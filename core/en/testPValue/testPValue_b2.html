<p>In the previous page, a diagram with scales illustrated how the evidence against 
<b>H<sub>0</sub></b> was 'weighed' for different data sets. A p-value is a numerical 
description of this evidence that can give a scale to this diagram.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Effect of pheromone on rabbits">  
<p class="heading">Effect of pheromone on rabbits</p>
<p>An experiment is conducted to assess whether rabbits are influenced by a particular 
pheromone, either positively or negatively. A large cage is constructed whose 
features (water, food, etc.) are duplicated symmetrically on both sides of a centre 
line. A rabbit is placed in the centre of the cage and a small quantity of the 
pheromone is added to one side. During the next 5 hours, a technician records 
the number of minutes that the rabbit spends in each half of the cage. This experiment 
is repeated with 16 rabbits. </p>
<p>Do the rabbits tend to spend half their time in each side of the cage (indicating 
that they are unaffected by the pheromone) or do they tend to spend more time 
in one or other half (indicating attraction or repulsion)? We examine this question 
using the <strong>difference</strong> between the times in the two sides of the 
cage, pheromone minus non-pheromone. This question is equivalent to asking whether 
there is evidence that the underlying population mean of these differences could 
be zero.</p>
<p>The diagram below weighs the evidence using the p-value from a t-test of whether 
µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.
