<p class="heading">Symmetric hypotheses</p>
<p>In some situations there is a kind of symmetry between the two competing hypotheses. 
The sample data provide information about which of the two hypotheses is true.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Shareholder meeting vote"> 
<p class="heading">Shareholder meeting vote</p>
<p>Two candidates, Mike Smith and Sarah Brown, stand for election as chairperson 
of the board of directors of a large company. Just before the shareholders' meeting 
at which the election will be held, 56 randomly selected shareholders are asked 
about their voting intentions. If the proportion intending to vote for Mike Smith 
is denoted by π, 
the hypotheses of interest are</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates how the poll results might weigh the evidence 
for each candidate winning.</p>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider to see how different sample numbers choosing 
Mike Smith affect the evidence. Unless either candidate receives (say) three quarters 
of the sample vote, we should admit that there is some doubt about who will win 
&mdash; the sample may not accurately reflect the population proportions. </p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Null and alternative hypotheses</p>

<p>In statistical hypothesis testing, the two hypotheses are <strong>not</strong> 
treated symmetrically in this way. We must distinguish in a much more fundamental 
way between them.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In statistical hypothesis testing, we do <span class="bold red">not</span>  
ask which of the two competing hypotheses is true.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Instead, we ask whether the sample data are consistent with one particular 
hypothesis (the <strong>null hypothesis</strong>, denoted by <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>). 
If the data are not consistent with the null hypothesis, then we can conclude 
that the competing hypothesis (the <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong>, denoted 
by <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>) must be true. </p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/nullAltHypoth.gif" width="381" height="165">
</p>

<p>This distinction between the hypotheses is important. Depending on the sample 
data, it may be possible to conclude that <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> is true. However, 
regardless of the data, the strongest we can say supporting <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> 
is that the data are consistent with it.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We <strong>can never conclude that <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> is 
likely to be true</strong>.</p>

<p class="heading">Market share estimation through audits</p>
<p>The traditional retail store audit is a widely used marketing research tool 
among consumer packaged goods companies. The retail store audit involves periodic 
audits of a sample of stores to monitor inventory and purchases of a particular 
product. Another auditing procedure, weekend selldown audits, has been proposed 
as a less expensive alternative.</p>
<p>The market shares of 10 brands of fruit juice were estimated using both of 
the store audit methods. Do the two methods result in the same estimates, on average? 
The data are paired, so we analyse the difference in estimates for each product 
(traditional minus weekend selldown) and test whether the underlying population 
mean of these values is zero.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the evidence obtained from a set of sample data.</p>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider to see the conclusions that might be reached for
data sets with different means. The further the sample mean is from zero (on either side), the
stronger the evidence that
µ is
<strong>not</strong> zero.
We can get very strong evidence that <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>
does <strong>not</strong> hold if the sample mean is far from zero.
</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>However even <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 
does not provide strong evidence that µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</p>
</div></div>

<p>If <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, 
µ 
could just as easily be 0.0001 or -0.0002 (which correspond to <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>). 
We cannot distinguish, so the best we can say is that the data are <strong>consistent</strong> 
with the null hypothesis &mdash; the data provide no information against the µ 
being zero. </p>

<p>In the context of this example, the conclusion from a sample mean of zero would 
be that the experiment gave <strong>no evidence</strong> of any difference between 
the mean estimates from the two auditing methods. The mean estimates <strong>might</strong> 
be different, but the data did not detect the effect.</p>

<p>The distinction between the null and alternative hypotheses is so important 
that we repeat it below.</p>
