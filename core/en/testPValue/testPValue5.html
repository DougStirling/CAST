<p class="heading">Applying the general properties of p-values to different 
tests </p>

<p>The properties of p-values (and hence their interpretation) have been demonstrated
in the context of a hypothesis test about whether a population mean was zero.
</p>

<p>P-values for <strong>all</strong> hypothesis tests have the same properties.
As a result, we can interpret any p-value if we know the null and
alternative hypotheses that it tests, even if we do not know the formulae that underlies it.
<span class="gray">(In practice, a statistical computer program is generally used to perform hypothesis tests,
so knowledge of formulae is of little importance.)</span>
</p>

<p>In particular, for any test where the null hypothesis restricts a parameter to a single
value,
</p>

<ul>
  <li>p-values have a rectangular distribution between 0 and 1 if
  <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds.</li>
      
  <li>p-values have a distribution that is more concentrated on 0 if
  <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> holds.</li>
      
  <li>If a p-value of <i>p</i> is observed, we can state that there is a probability <i>p</i>
  of obtaining a p-value so low when
  <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds.</li>
      
  <li>The table below therefore provides a guide for interpreting a p-value:</li>
</ul>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Testing normality">
	<p class="heading">Another type of test</p>
	<p>The normal distribution is often used as a hypothetical population from 
	  which a set of data are assumed to be sampled. But are the data consistent 
	  with an underlying normal population, or does the population distribution 
	  have a different shape? </p>

<p>One popular test for assessing whether a random sample come from a normal population
is the <strong>Shapiro-Wilkes W test</strong>. The theory behind the test is advanced and
the formula for the p-value cannot be readily evaluated by hand. However most statistical
programs will perform the test.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="550" height="300">

</div>

<p>A random sample of 40 values from a normal population is displayed in a jittered dot plot
on the left of the diagram. The p-value for the Shapiro-Wilkes W test is shown under the
dot plot and also graphically on the right.
</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to take more samples and build the
distribution of the p-values for the test. You should observe that the p-values have a
rectangular distribution between 0 and 1 when the null hypothesis is true (i.e. if the samples
are from a normal distribution).
</p>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider on the top left of the diagram to change the shape of
the population distribution. Repeat the exercise above and observe that when the null hypothesis
does <strong>not</strong> hold, the p-values tend to be closer to 0.
</p>

<p class="gray">Click on crosses on the display of p-values in the bottom right to
display the sample that produced that p-value. P-values near zero usually correspond to
samples that have very long tails to one or both sides, or have very short tails to one or
both sides.
</p>

<p class="heading">Measuring the speed of light</p>
<p>As a numerical example, consider the following experimental measurements
made by a scientist, Simon Newcomb, in 1882 for the purpose of estimating the speed
of light in air. The values were the times in nanoseconds (0.000000001 seconds) for
light to travel 7442 metres. Since the measurements were all close to 24,800, they
have been coded
</p>

<p>The coded data and a histogram are shown below.

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" class="centred">

<p>The best-fitting normal distribution (with mean and standard deviation equal to those
of the data) has been superimposed on the histogram. Could the two 'outliers' in the data
have occurred by chance from a normal population?
</p>

<p>Applying the Shapiro-Wilkes W test to the data using the statistical program JMP gives
a p-value '0.0000'. Since JMP rounds p-values to four decimal places, this really means that
the p-value is less than 0.00005. We therefore conclude that the probability of obtaining such
a non-normal looking sample from a normal distribution is less than 0.00005, so there is extremely
strong evidence that the data do not come from a normal population.
</p>

<p>In contrast, if the two 'outliers' are omitted, JMP reports a p-value of 0.6167 for the test.
Since a p-value as low as this would be found from 62% of samples from a normal population,
there is no evidence that the data <strong>without</strong> the outliers are non-normal. The test
therefore lends support to the assertion that the two outliers resulted from errors in Newcomb's
experimental procedures.
</p>

</div>

<p>You should be able to interpret p-values that computer software provides for a wide
variety of hypothesis tests using the properties that we have described in this section.
