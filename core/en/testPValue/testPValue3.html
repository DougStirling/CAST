<p class="heading">Interpretation of p-values</p>

<p>Many different types of hypothesis test are commonly used in advanced statistics, but all
share common features.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>They ask whether data are consistent with a null hypothesis about a population, <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>,
  	or support an alternative hypothesis, <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>.
  <li>A p-value provides a numerical summary of the evidence against <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>.</li>
  <li>The p-value is the probability of such 'extreme' data when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>
  	is true.</li>
  <li>The closer the p-value to zero, the stronger the evidence against <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A p-value is a statistic that is evaluated from a random sample, so it has a
distribution in the same way that a sample mean has a distribution. This distribution also
has features that are common to all hypothesis tests. Understanding the distribution of
p-values is the key to understanding how they are interpreted.
</p>

<p class=heading>Distribution of p-values</p>

<p>In any hypothesis test,
</p>

<ul>
    <li>When the null hypothesis, <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>, is true, all p-values
between 0 and 1 are equally likely. In other words, the p-value has a distribution
whose density function has constant height between 0 and 1 (a <em>rectangular</em> distribution). <br>
      &nbsp;</li>
  <li>On the other hand, if <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>
	is true, then the p-values have a distribution for which p-values near zero are more likely
	than p-values near 1. The precise distribution under the alternative hypothesis depends on the
	specific hypotheses being tested and the true value of the parameter, but it always favours
	values near 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>The diagram below shows typical distributions that might be obtained.

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Testing for zero mean">

<p>To illustrate these properties, we use a test for whether a population mean is zero.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" class="centred" style="color:#000000; background-color:#FFFFFF; border:1px solid #000000">

		<td valign="middle">µ &nbsp;= &nbsp;0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="right" valign="middle"><strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> &nbsp; <span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:16; font-weight:bold">H<sub>A</sub></span> : &nbsp;</td>

</div>

<p>In the diagram below, you will take random samples from a normal population for which
<b>H<sub>0</sub></b> is true and, separately, from populations for which <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>
is true.

<p class=heading>When <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds
</p>

<p>Initially the population mean is zero, so
<b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds. A single sample
from this population is shown on the left and the p-value for testing whether the population
mean is zero is shown as a cross on the jittered dot plot on the bottom right.
</p>

<p>Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to take other samples from this
population and add their p-values to the display on the bottom right. After taking 50 or more samples,
you should observe that the p-values are spread evenly between 0 and 1. This supports our
assertion that the p-values have a rectangular distribution between 0 and 1 when
<b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds.
</p>

<p class=heading>When <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> holds
</p>

<p>Now use the slider to change the true population mean to 2.0. We are still testing
whether the mean is zero, so <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> now holds. Take 40 or 50
samples and observe that the p-values are usually closer to 0 than to 1.
</p>

<p>Click on some of the larger p-values on the jittered dot plot to display the samples
that gave rise to them. The sample means vary and, by chance, some samples have means that are
near 0.0, even when the population mean is 2.0; these samples result in larger p-values.
</p>

<p>Repeat this exercise with different population means (try at least 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and -2.0).
The further the population mean from the value targetted by <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>, 0.0,
the more tightly clustered the p-values are around 0.0.
</p>

</div>

<p>Although it is possible to obtain a low p-value when
<b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds
and a high p-value when <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>
holds, low p-values are more likely under
<b>H<sub>A</sub></b> than under
<b>H<sub>0</sub></b>.
