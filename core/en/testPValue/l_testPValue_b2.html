<p>This diagram illustrates that the p-value puts a numerical value to the scale of the  type of diagram used on the previous page &mdash; it describes whether the data are consistent with the null hypothesis, <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>.</p>

  <p>The p-value is an <span class="bold red">index of credibility</span>  for the null hypothesis, µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.

  <p>An experiment is conducted to assess whether rabbits are influenced by a particular 
pheromone, either positively or negatively. A large cage is constructed whose 
features (water, food, etc.) are duplicated symmetrically on both sides of a centre 
line. A rabbit is placed in the centre of the cage and a small quantity of the 
pheromone is added to one side. During the next 5 hours, a technician records 
the number of minutes that the rabbit spends in each half of the cage. This experiment 
is repeated with 16 rabbits. </p>
  <p>Do the rabbits tend to spend half their time in each side of the cage (indicating 
    that they are unaffected by the pheromone) or do they tend to spend more time 
    in one or other half (indicating attraction or repulsion)? We examine this question 
    using the <strong>difference</strong> between the times in the two sides of the 
    cage, pheromone minus non-pheromone. This question is equivalent to asking whether 
    there is evidence that the underlying population mean of these differences could 
    be zero. If µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, the pheromone has no effect, whereas µ&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 indicates a preference for it and µ&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0 indicates avoidance of it.</p>
