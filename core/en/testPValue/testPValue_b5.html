<p class="heading">Applying the general properties of p-values to different 
	tests </p>

<p>The properties of p-values (and hence their interpretation) have been demonstrated
in the context of a hypothesis test about whether a population mean was zero.
</p>

<p>P-values for <strong>all</strong> hypothesis tests have the same properties.
As a result, we can interpret any p-value if we know the null and
alternative hypotheses that it tests, even if we do not know the formulae that underlies it.
<span class="gray">(In practice, a statistical computer program is generally used to perform hypothesis tests,
so knowledge of formulae is of little importance.)</span>
</p>

<p>In particular, for any test where the null hypothesis restricts a parameter to a single
value,
</p>

<ul>
  <li>p-values have a rectangular distribution between 0 and 1 if
  <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds.</li>
      
  <li>p-values have a distribution that is more concentrated on 0 if
  <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> holds.</li>
      
  <li>If a p-value of <i>p</i> is observed, we can state that there is a probability <i>p</i>
  of obtaining a p-value so low when
  <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds.</li>
      
  <li>The table below therefore provides a guide for interpreting a p-value:</li>
</ul>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Testing normality">
	<p class="heading">Another type of test</p>
	<p>The normal distribution is often used as a hypothetical population from 
	  which a set of data are assumed to be sampled. But are the data consistent 
	  with an underlying normal population, or does the population distribution 
	  have a different shape? </p>

<p>One popular test for assessing whether a random sample come from a normal population
is the <strong>Shapiro-Wilkes W test</strong>. The theory behind the test is advanced and
the formula for the p-value cannot be readily evaluated by hand. However most statistical
programs will perform the test.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="550" height="300">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="testProg.ShapiroWilkesApplet">
<param name="varName" value="Simulated data">

</applet>
</div>

<p>A random sample of 40 values from a normal population is displayed in a jittered dot plot
on the left of the diagram. The p-value for the Shapiro-Wilkes W test is shown under the
dot plot and also graphically on the right.
</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to take more samples and build the
distribution of the p-values for the test. You should observe that the p-values have a
rectangular distribution between 0 and 1 when the null hypothesis is true (i.e. if the samples
are from a normal distribution).
</p>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider on the top left of the diagram to change the shape of
the population distribution. Repeat the exercise above and observe that when the null hypothesis
does <strong>not</strong> hold, the p-values tend to be closer to 0.
</p>

<p class="gray">Click on crosses on the display of p-values in the bottom right to
display the sample that produced that p-value. P-values near zero usually correspond to
samples that have very long tails to one or both sides, or have very short tails to one or
both sides.
</p>

<p class="heading">PSA measurements</p>
<p>As a numerical example, consider the following data set which gives measurements 
of serum acid phosphatase (PSA) for 53 patients who were diagnosed as having prostate 
cancer. </p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" class="centred">

<p>The best-fitting normal distribution (with mean and standard deviation equal 
to those of the data) has been superimposed on the histogram. Could the impression 
of skewness have occurred by chance? </p>
<p>Applying the Shapiro-Wilkes W test to the data using the statistical program 
SAS gives a p-value '0.0001'. We therefore conclude that the probability of obtaining 
such a non-normal looking sample from a normal distribution is 0.0001, so there 
is extremely strong evidence that the data do not come from a normal population. 
</p>
<p>Even if the highest three values in the data set are omitted, the p-value for 
the Shapiro-Wilkes test is still 0.0039, so even without these values there is 
still strong evidence of skewness in the remainder of the data. </p>
</div>

<p>You should be able to interpret p-values that computer software provides for a wide
variety of hypothesis tests using the properties that we have described in this section.
