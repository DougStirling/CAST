<p class="heading">Model with curvature and interaction</p>
  <p>We have now expanded the linear model,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../nonlinTwo/images/xzModel.gif" width="214" height="17"></p>
	<p>with quadratic terms to explain curvature and with an interaction term. These 
		can be combined in a model that has both nonlinearity and interaction,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/quadInteractModel.gif" width="412" height="22"></p>
	<p>An example illustrates this model.</p>

  <div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Energy expenditure of bees</p>

		<p>On the previous page, we found that there was strong evidence of interaction 
			between temperature and sucrose on energy expenditure of bees. <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('nonlinTwo9')">Much 
			earlier</a>, we also found that there was moderately strong evidence of 
			curvature in the relationship of temperature to energy expenditure, but 
			not of sucrose. The diagram below shows the fit of a model with both interaction 
			and quadratic terms in temperature and sucrose.</p>

		<p>In this model, there is still strong evidence of interaction between the 
			effects of temperature and sucrose, and of curvature in the effect of temperature.</p>
		<p>Note however that there is now <strong>also</strong> evidence of nonlinearity 
			in the effect of sucrose &mdash; its p-value has reduced from 0.1023 in the earlier 
			model without an interaction term to 0.0243 in this model. There is therefore 
			also moderately strong evidence that the relationship of energy expenditure 
			to sucrose is also nonlinear.</p>
		<p>The reason is that the interaction term has explained a considerable amount 
			of the variation in energy expenditure, so the residuals and the estimate 
			of the error standard deviation are much smaller with an interaction term. 
			Since the latter is part of the denominator of all t-ratios, the t-ratios 
			have become bigger and more significant.</p>

<p>The lower the unexplained variation in the response, the greater 
					the chance of detecting explanatory variables (and terms) that have 
					a small effect on the response.</p>
