<p>The cumulative distribution function, \(F(x)\), can be used to find the probability that an exponentially distributed variable, \(X\), lies within any two limits</p>
\[ \begin{align}
P(a \lt X \lt b) \;\;=\;\; P(X \lt b) - P(X \lt a) \;\;&amp;=\;\; F(b) - F(a) \\
&amp;=\;\; e^{-a\lambda} - e^{-b\lambda}
\end{align} \]

		<p>An organisation's web site is accessed at a constant rate of 20 times per hour between 9am and 5pm. After an update to the site at 10am, what is the probability that the first access is between 10:05am and 10:10am?</p>

<p>The exponential distribution has an important property called its <strong>memoryless</strong> property.</p>
<div class="theoremProof">
	<div class="theorem">
		<p class="theoremTitle">Memoryless property of exponential distribution</p>
		<p>If \(X \sim  \ExponDistn(\lambda) \),</p>
\[
P(X \gt s+t \;|\; X \gt s) \;\; = \; \; P(X \gt t) \quad\quad \text{for all }s,t \ge 0\]
		<p>In other words, knowing that there were no events in the interval \((0, s]\) gives no information about how long it will take for the first event to occur <strong>after</strong> time \(s\).</p>

<p class="heading">Time between events</p>
<p>The memoryless property of a Poisson process with rate \(\lambda\) also means that if it is known that an event happened at time \(s\), the time from then until the <strong>next</strong> event in the process <strong>also</strong> has an \(\ExponDistn(\lambda) \) distribution.</p>
<p>The exponential distribution therefore also describes the time <strong>between </strong> events in a Poisson process.</p>
