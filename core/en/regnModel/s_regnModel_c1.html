<p class="heading notPrinted">Bivariate data: population or sample?</p>
<p>In most bivariate data sets, we have no interest in the specific individuals from
which the data are collected. The individuals are 'representative' of a larger population
or process, and our main interest is in this underlying population. </p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>A  newspaper compiled data from each of New Jersey's 21 counties about the
number of people per bank branch in each county and its percentage of minority
groups.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_sampleScatter_c.gif" width="403" height="316"></p>
<p>Local residents might be interested in the specific counties, but most outsiders
would want to <strong>generalise</strong> from the data to describe the relationship
in a way that might describe other <strong>similar</strong> areas in the Eastern
USA. How strong is the evidence that banks tend to have fewer branches in areas
with large minority groups?</p>
