<p class="heading notPrinted">Bivariate data: population or sample?</p>
<p>In most bivariate data sets, we have no interest in the specific individuals from
which the data are collected. The individuals are 'representative' of a larger population
or process, and our main interest is in this underlying population. </p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>Data  were collected by biologists from 15 lakes
in central Ontario to assess how zinc concentrations in an aquatic plant were related
to zinc concentrations in the lake sediment.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_sampleScatter.gif" width="403" height="316"></p>
<p>The biologists want to <strong>generalise</strong> from
these specific lakes (and sediment samples) to describe the relationship between
zinc concentrations in sediments and plants in a way that might be used to predict
plant zinc from sediment samples in <strong>other
similar </strong> lakes.</p>
