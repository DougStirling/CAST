<p class="heading">Normal probabilitiy plots</p>
<p>A normal linear model assumes that the model errors are 
normally distributed. A probability plot of residuals helps to detect non-normality.</p>

<p class="heading">Warning</p>
<p>If the assumptions of linearity and constant variance are violated, or if there 
are outliers, the probability plot of residuals will often be curved, irrespective 
of the error distribution.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Only draw a probability plot if you are sure that the data are linear, 
have constant variance and have no outliers.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Outliers &mdash; Deer data</p>
<p>In the Deer data above, most of the probabilitiy plot is fairly linear. The 
long tails to the residual distribution could perhaps be caused by a small number 
of outliers in the data.</p>
<p>If possible, it would be worth checking that there were no measurement or transcription 
errors for the most extreme residuals. Perhaps these measurements were made by 
one particular hunter who incorrectly measured jaw length?</p>

<p class="heading">Nonlinearity &mdash; Antibiotic effectiveness</p>
<p>Nonlinearity in the relationship can have the opposite effect on the shape 
of a probability plot &mdash; the tails of the distribution of residuals may be shorter 
than those for a normal distribution.</p>
