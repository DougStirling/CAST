<p class="heading">Outliers and errors</p>
<p>An outlier is a measurement that does not fit in with the pattern exhibited 
by the rest of the data. By definition, an outlier does not satisfy the normal 
linear model that fits the rest of the data, so it should be omitted from the 
analysis. </p>

<p class="heading">Standardised residuals</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a real data set, the errors are unknown, so we must use the 
residuals from the least squares line as estimates of the errors. The residuals 
can be used in a similar way to give information about whether there is an outlier.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'regnProblem', 'residStdDevn', '600', '460');</script>

<p>Most statistical software will evaluate standardised residuals 
		for you when you fit a line by least squares and automatically report any 
		that are more extreme than ±3 &mdash; they are often taken to indicate possible outliers.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering however that there is still a probability 0.003 that 
a value from the standard normal distribution will be outside ±3. In a 
data set of 1,000 values, it would therefore be <strong>expected</strong> that 
3 values would be labelled as 'outliers' by this rule.</p>
