<p class="heading">Independence of the errors</p>
<p>Although we have not stressed it earlier, an important assumption in the normal 
linear model is that the different errors are uncorrelated with each other. Occasionally 
some individuals are 'close' in a way that means an 'unusually' high response 
measurement will be associated with unusually high measurements in nearby individuals 
&mdash; their errors are correlated.</p>
<p>For example, in an experiment in a greenhouse, adjacent plants will be grown 
in similar conditions (light, moisture, air flow) so an unusually high growth 
rate for one plant may be associated with environmental conditions that also cause 
unusually high growth rates in adjacent plants.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Good experimental design tries to ensure that all experimental units 
are similar, but correlation between 'adjacent' errors is sometimes unavoidable.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Correlated errors and time series</p>
<p>Correlated errors are most common when the observations are made sequentially 
in time. There are often influences on the response that are not explicitly recorded 
or modelled but that change gradually over time resulting in successive errors 
being correlated. This is called <strong>serial correlation</strong>.</p>
<p>Serial correlation is especially common when modelling time series &mdash; i.e. 
when we are using a normal linear model with time as the explanatory variable.</p>
<p class="heading">Assessing serial correlation</p>
<p>Strong serial correlation may be visible in a plot of residuals against time, 
but it is often difficult to assess whether the pattern could have arisen by chance. 
A test statistic called the <strong>Durbin-Watson statistic</strong> is often 
used to assess whether there is serial correlation. Writing the successive residuals 
as <em>e</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>e</em><sub>2</sub>, ..., <em>e<sub>n</sub></em>, 
this statistic is defined as:</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../regnProblem/images/durbWatson.gif" width="127" height="51"> 
</p>
<p>When the serial correlation is high, successive residuals will be similar, 
their differences will be small and the test statistic will be close to zero.</p>
<p>The p-value for the test based on the Durbin-Watson statistic is the probability 
of getting such a low value of <em>d</em> when there is no serial correlation. 
An approximate p-value can be obtained from special statistical tables, but it 
can also be determined with a simulation, as described in the example below.</p>

<p>The scatterplot on the left shows the data and a least squares line. The residuals 
on the right do not indicate any problems with curvature or non-constant variance.</p>
<p>To assess whether there is serial correlation in the errors, the Durbin-Watson 
statistic has been evaluated. Is a value of 1.291 indicative of serial correlation?</p>
<p>Select <strong>Random Normal Data</strong> from the pop-up menu. This shows 
a randomly generated data set from a linear model with β<sub>0</sub>, 
β<sub>1</sub> and σ 
the same as the least squares estimates from the actual time series.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong>, then click <strong>Simulate</strong> about 
100 times to build up the sampling distribution of the Durbin-Watson statistic. 
You should see that a value as low as 1.291 is very unlikely for data like this 
from a normal linear model, so there is strong evidence that successive errors 
are correlated.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is strong evidence that years with unusually high (or low) yield 
tend to follow each other.</p>

<p class="heading">Warning</p>
<p>If a linear model is used for a time series, but the relationship is actually 
nonlinear, successive residuals also tend to be similar and the Durbin-Watson 
statistic will also be small.</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>An unusually small Durbin-Watson statistic can be caused by <strong>either 
serial correlation or nonlinearity</strong>.</p>

<p>The test only suggests serial correlation if you are sure that the data are 
linear.</p>
