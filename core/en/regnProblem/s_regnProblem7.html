<p class="heading notPrinted">Independence of the errors</p>
<p>The normal
linear model assumes that the  errors are uncorrelated with each other, but correlated
errors sometimes arise.</p>
<p>Correlated errors may arise in an experiment in a greenhouse where adjacent
plants will be grown in similar conditions (light, moisture, air flow). An
unusually high growth rate for one plant may be associated with environmental
conditions that also cause unusually high growth rates in adjacent plants.</p>
<p>Correlated errors are most common when the observations are made sequentially
in time. This is called <strong>serial correlation</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Assessing serial correlation</p>
<p>Strong serial correlation may be visible in a plot of residuals against time.
A more formal test uses a test statistic called the <strong>Durbin-Watson
statistic, <em>d</em></strong>. Writing the successive
residuals as <em>e</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>e</em><sub>2</sub>, ..., <em>e<sub>n</sub></em>,</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../HregnProblem/durbWatson.gif" width="127" height="51"> </p>
<p>If successive residuals are  similar,
<em>d</em> will be close to zero. An approximate p-value can be obtained  from
a computer, special statistical tables or with a simulation such as that below.</p>

<p class="heading">Warning</p>
<p>If a linear model is used for a time series, but the relationship is actually
nonlinear, successive residuals also tend to be similar and the Durbin-Watson
statistic will also be small.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>An unusually small Durbin-Watson statistic can be caused by <strong>either
serial correlation or nonlinearity</strong>.</p>
