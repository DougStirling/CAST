<p class="heading">Nonlinear relationships</p>
	<p>A simple linear model is only appropriate when the cloud of crosses 
	in a scatterplot of the data is regularly spread around a straight line. If the crosses are scattered round a <strong>curve</strong>, the relationship is called <strong>nonlinear</strong> and
other models must be used.</p>
<p class="heading">Outliers</p>
<p>Another problem arises if there are <strong>outliers</strong> &mdash; observations that do not conform to the 
		pattern and variability exhibited by the rest of the data. In a linear model, 
		the most important type of outlier is a data point that lies at a distance 
		from the line that would fit through the rest of the data. </p>
	<p>The individual corresponding to any outlier should be carefully examined. Recording
		or transcription errors may be the cause. Alternatively, it may be possible to determine some
		distinguishing characteristic of the individual that underlies the unusual response
		measurement. </p>
	<p>If an outlier is extreme enough, or if a special cause for its unusual behaviour can be
		found from outside information, the individual can be classified as aberrant
		and deleted from the data set.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>It is important to <strong>look at any data set graphically</strong> before
fitting a linear model to check that no curvature or outliers is present.</p>
