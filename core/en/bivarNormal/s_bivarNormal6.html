<p>We now present an application of the bivariate normal distribution.</p>
<div class="questionSoln">
	<div class="question">
		<p class="questionTitle">Example: Heights of parents and children</p>
		<p>In the late 19th century, Francis Galton analysed data about the relationship between the heights of children to those of their parents. This was based on measurements of the adult heights of 928 children and the average heights of their parents, with all measurements in inches. (Female heights were multiplied by 1.08 to compensate for sex differences.)</p>
		<p class="eqn"><img src="images/galtonScatterplot.png" width="505" height="466"/></p>
		<p>From a jittered scatterplot, both marginal distributions seem reasonably symmetric and normal, so a bivariate normal distribution was fitted to the data, with its parameters estimated by the sample means and variances of the two variables and the sample correlation coefficient.</p>
\[
(C, P) \sim \NormalDistn(\mu_C = 68.09, \mu_P = 68.31, \sigma_C^2 = 6.340, \sigma_P^2 = 3.195, \rho = 0.459
\]
		
		<p>Assuming that this bivariate normal distribution is accurate,</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What is the probability that a child will have height over 71 inches?</li>
			<li>If the mid-height of the parents is 71 inches, what is the expected height of their child and what is the probability that it is over 71 inches?</li>
		</ul>
