<p class="heading">Forecasts</p>
  
<p>If a  time series has no seasonal component, two simple forecasting methods are with linear regression (if there is a linear trend) and exponential smoothing (especially if there is a cyclical component).<br>
</p>
<div class="diagram">
<p> The exercise below shows a time series and you are asked to forecast a future value both with exponential smoothing and linear regression..</p>
<p>Note that the regression should be performed based on a coded year. The year that is coded as zero is defined in the question (and varies between different versions of the question).</p>
