<p class="heading notPrinted">Using linear and quadratic models for forecasting</p>
	<p>After fitting a linear or quadratic model by least squares, forecasting 
		is simply a matter of inserting future time values into its equation.</p>
	<p class="heading">Dangers in forecasting</p>
	<p>It is important to realise that the forecasts from linear or quadratic models
are highly dependent on the type of line or curve that is chosen for modelling.
The dangers are the same as those for extrapolation in bivariate relationships.</p>

<p>Beware forecasting many time periods into the future &mdash; the 
				shape of the actual trend line might be different from your model.</p>
