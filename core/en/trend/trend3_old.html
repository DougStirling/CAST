<p class="heading">Using linear and quadratic models for forecasting</p>
	<p>Having obtained the equation of a trend line by least squares, forecasting 
		is simply a matter of inserting future time values into the equation.</p>

		<p>The least squares line has been drawn on the time series plot and has been 
			extended 6 years into the future. Drag over the diagram to display the forecasts 
			for these years. (Note that the 'forecasts' for earlier years in which we 
			already have data are the fitted values for the linear model.)</p>
		<p>The linear model is a poor fit for these data &mdash; the model does not pick 
			up the steeper increase in the last few years of the series. Select <strong>Quadratic 
			Model</strong> from the pop-up menu and repeat. The quadratic model gives 
			reasonable forecasts for a few years, though you should have some doubts 
			about using the model to predict as far into the future as 2006!</p>

	<p class="heading">Dangers in forecasting</p>
	
<p>It is important to realise that the forecasts from linear or quadratic models 
are highly dependent on the type of line or curve that is chosen for modelling. 
The dangers are the same as those for <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('curvature4')">extrapolation 
in bivariate relationships</a>.</p>

<p>Beware forecasting many time periods into the future &mdash; the 
			shape of the actual trend line might be different from your model.</p>
