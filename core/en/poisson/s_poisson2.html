<p>In a homogeneous Poisson process with events that occur at a rate of \(\lambda\) per unit time, we  now define a discrete random variable, \(X\), to be the number of events that occur in one unit of time.</p>
<p>If the unit of time is split into infinitessimally small periods, each of length \(\delta t\), the requirements of a homogeneous Poisson process mean that</p>
<ol>
	<li>No more than one event can occur in each period.</li>
	<li>The occurrences of events in different small periods are independent.</li>
	<li>The probability of an event in any interval is \(\lambda \times \delta t\).</li>
</ol>
<p class="heading">Binomial approximation</p>
<p>To derive the probability function of \(X\), we start with a situation in which the above three conditions hold, but \(\delta t\) is larger. If unit time is split into \(n\) intervals, each of length \(\frac 1 n\), the three conditions would mean that the number of events is the number of successes in a series of \(n\) independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability \(\pi = \frac {\lambda} n\) of success, so</p>
\[
X \;\sim\; \BinomDistn \left(n, \pi = \frac {\lambda} n\right)
\]
<p>The probability function for the number of events in a homogeneous Poisson process can be found as the limit of the probability function of this binomial distribution, as \(n \to \infty\).</p>
