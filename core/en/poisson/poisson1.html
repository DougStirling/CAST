<p class="heading">Simple model for events in time</p>

<p>There are many situations in which 'events' happen at random times. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Patients arriving at a hospital's Accident and Emergency Clinic</li>
	<li>Fatal traffic accidents in a region</li>
	<li>Phone calls received by a cellphone tower</li>
	<li>Particles emitted by a radioactive source</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest kind of model for events in time is called a <strong>homogeneous Poisson process</strong>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>A <strong>homogeneous Poisson process</strong> is a series of events that occur over time in which:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Multiple events cannot happen at exactly the same time.</li>
	<li>The occurrence of events during any interval of time is independent of whether events occurred in other non-overlapping intervals.</li>
	<li>The probability of an event happening in any infinitesimally small interval \((t, t+\delta t]\) is \(\lambda \times \delta t\).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Expressing this less formally,</p>
<ol>
	<li>events happen singly,</li>
	<li>occurrence of events at different times are independent, and</li>
	<li>the chance of an event happening is the same at all times.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be generalised to a non-homogeneous Poisson process if we allow the chance of an event happening to vary over time, replacing the constant \(\lambda\) with a function of time \(\lambda(t)\).</p>
<p class="heading">Rate of occurrence of events</p>
<p>In a homogeneous Poisson process, the parameter \(\lambda\) is the <strong>rate </strong>of events occurring. For example,  a model for emergency requests for ambulances from a hospital might have \(\lambda = 1.5\) call-outs per hour. The assumption that the call-outs occur as a homogeneous Poisson process means that:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Two or more call-outs are possible in any hour, but multiple events are virtually impossible in a second (and impossible in a short enough time period).</li>
	<li>Knowing that there were call-outs in one hour does not affect the probability of call-outs in the next hour (or any other later time period).</li>
	<li>A rate of  \(\lambda = 1.5\) per hour is equivalent to \(\lambda = \frac{1.5} {60}\) per minute or \(\lambda = \frac{1.5} {3,600}\) per second. Over very small intervals of time, \(\lambda\) can be interpreted as a probability; for example, the probability of a call-out in any second is approximately \(\frac{1.5} {3,600}\).</li>
</ol>
<p>This model would be an over-simplification of reality. It might be possible for two ambulances to be called out simultaneously after a bad road accident. Moreover, the rate of call-outs is likely to vary between different times of day. However a homogeneous Poisson is an <strong>approximation</strong> that might still be able to give reasonable insight.</p>
<p class="heading">Single events</p>
<p>We have introduced Poisson processes for situations where <strong>multiple</strong> events  happen over time. Sometimes  only <strong>one</strong> such event that may happen. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A light bulb failing</li>
	<li>A 60 year old male with lung cancer dying</li>
	<li>A building being destroyed by fire</li>
</ul>
<p>The time until the event happens is random, and it can be modelled as the <strong>first</strong> event in a homogeneous Poisson process.</p>
