<p class="heading">Simple model for events in time</p>

<p>There are many situations in which 'events' happen at random times. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>Patients arriving at a hospital's Accident and Emergency Clinic</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest kind of model for such events  is  a <strong>homogeneous Poisson process</strong>. </p>

<div class="definition">
<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>A <strong>homogeneous Poisson process</strong> is a series of events that occur over time in which:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Multiple events cannot happen at exactly the same time.</li>
	<li>The occurrence of events during any interval of time is independent of whether events occurred in other non-overlapping intervals.</li>
	<li>The probability of an event happening in any infinitesimally small interval \((t, t+\delta t]\) is \(\lambda \times \delta t\).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Less formally,</p>
<ol>
	<li>events happen singly,</li>
	<li>occurrence of events at different times are independent, and</li>
	<li>the chance of an event happening is the same at all times.</li>
</ol>
<p>The parameter \(\lambda\) is the <strong>rate </strong>of events occurring and is expressed as &quot;events per unit time&quot;. For example,  a model for emergency requests for ambulances from a hospital might have \(\lambda = 1.5\) call-outs per hour.</p>
<p>This model is often an over-simplification of reality. It might be possible for two ambulances to be called out simultaneously after a bad road accident (not satisfying condition 1). Moreover, the rate of call-outs is likely to vary between different times of day (not satisfying condition 3). However a homogeneous Poisson is an <strong>approximation</strong> that might still be able to give reasonable insight.</p>
<p>The model can be generalised to a <strong>non-homogeneous</strong> Poisson process if we allow the chance of an event happening to vary over time, replacing the constant \(\lambda\) with a function of time \(\lambda(t)\).</p>
<p class="heading">Single events</p>
<p>There are some scenarios in which only <strong>one</strong> such event  may happen. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>A light bulb failing</li>
</ul>
<p>The time until the event happens is also random, and  can be modelled as the time to the <strong>first</strong> event in a homogeneous Poisson process.</p>
