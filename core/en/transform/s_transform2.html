<p class="heading">Nonlinear transformations</p>
	<p>Nonlinear transformations arise when the values are replaced by a nonlinear function of the original measurements, such as their logarithm or inverse. They  have a more fundamental effect on
	the shape of a distribution than linear transformations. </p>
	<p>The most commonly used nonlinear transformation is:</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><strong>new value</strong> &nbsp; = log<sub>10</sub> <font size="+1">(</font><strong>old value</strong><font size="+1">)</font></span> </p>
	<p>Natural logarithms (base <em>e</em>) have a similar effect on the distribution
of values but base-10 logarithms are easier to interpret so we use them here.</p>
<p class="heading">Properties of logarithms</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Multiplying any value by 10 increases its logarithm by 1.</li>
		<li>Doubling any value increases its logarithm by log<sub>10</sub>(2) = 0.3010.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider four values 1, 10, 100 and 1000. The first two values are much closer 
		to each other than the last two values. However their logarithms are 0, 1, 
		2 and 3, so their logarithms are evenly spaced out.</p>
	<p class="heading">Effect on the shape of a distribution</p>
	<p>A logarithmic transformation selectively spreads out low values 
		in a distribution and compresses high values. It is therefore useful before
analysing skew data with a long tail towards the high values. It will spread
out a dense cluster of low values and may detect clustering or outliers that
would not be visible in graphical displays of the original data.</p>
