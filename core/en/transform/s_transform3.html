<p class="heading notPrinted">'Quantities'</p>
	<p>Logarithmic transformation can only be used for data sets consisting of positive
 values &mdash; logarithms are undefined for negative or zero values. They are therefore
particularly useful for <strong>quantities</strong> &mdash; 
		i.e. amounts of something. Indeed, many researchers <strong>routinely</strong> apply
logarithmic transformation  to quantity data before analysis.</p>
<p class="heading notPrinted">When are they effective?</p>
	<p>A log transformation affects the shape of the distribution most when the
ratio of the largest to the smallest value in the data is large. When this ratio
is less than 10 (one <strong>order of magnitude</strong>) then the transformation
has much less influence on the shape of the distribution, as in the data set
below.</p>
