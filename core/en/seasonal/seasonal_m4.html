<p class="heading">Removing the seasonal effect</p>

  <p>Having estimated a common seasonal effect that describes how far each month's 
		value is (on average) from the overall trend, we can subtract this seasonal 
		effect to obtain <strong>deseasonalised data</strong>. This is often called 
		<strong>seasonally adjusting</strong> the data.</p>
	<p>Since we have a seasonal effect for every month, it is possible to deseasonalise 
    up to both ends of a time series. This is an important advantage over smoothing 
    out the seasonal effect with moving averages.</p>
	<p>The deseasonalised data not only shows the trend in the series more clearly, 
    but also shows <strong>individual</strong> months that are substantially different 
    from the usual seasonal pattern.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Monthly temperatures in Boulder, Colorado">
<p class="heading">Monthly temperatures in Boulder, Colorado</p>
		<p>The time series plot below shows mean monthly temperature in Boulder Colorado 
			and the corresponding deseasonalised data.</p>

		<p>The seasonal effects are shown at the bottom of the diagram. Click on the 
			December seasonal effect. All deseasonalised values for December are the 
			actual December temperatures minus the December seasonal effect. (This 
			is highlighted in red on the top time series plot). Note that all December 
			temperatures are reduced by the same amount to deseasonalise them.</p>
		<p>The peaks and troughs of the deseasonalised series clearly show 'unusual' 
			months. In particular,</p>
