<p class="heading">Removing the seasonal effect</p>
	<p>Having estimated a common seasonal effect that describes how far each month's 
		value is (on average) from the overall trend, we can subtract this seasonal 
		effect to obtain <strong>deseasonalised data</strong>. This is often called <strong>seasonally adjusting</strong> the data.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_removeEffect.gif" width="495" height="497"></p>
	<p>The time series can be deseasonalised in this way for <strong>all</strong> years (including the most recent data).</p>
	<p>The deseasonalised data not only shows the trend in the series more clearly, 
		but also shows <strong>individual</strong> months that are substantially different 
		from the usual seasonal pattern.</p>
