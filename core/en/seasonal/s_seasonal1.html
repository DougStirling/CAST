<p class="heading notPrinted">Seasonal data</p>
	<p>In monthly or quarterly data, there is often a pattern of peaks and troughs
 that repeats in a similar way each year. Daily data often show a  pattern
 that repeats each week, and hourly data often have a daily pattern. These 
		are all called <strong>seasonal patterns</strong>.</p>

	<p>Seasonal patterns make it difficult to assess whether a particular month's value is unusually high or low.</p>
	<p>Regular seasonal patterns can be projected into the future and are  important
 in forecasting.</p>
