<p class="heading">Population proportions and probabilities</p>
	<p>Categorical data are usually treated as a random sample from some  population. We concentrate on a single category which we will call <strong>success</strong> and we collectively call the other categories <strong>failures</strong>. The 
	population proportion of successes is denoted by π. It is also the <strong>probability</strong> that a single randomly selected value from the population is a success.</p>
	<p>We are interested in estimating an underlying probability, π. Although it is more general to treat π as a probability, it is  usually easier to interpret π as a 'population proportion'.</p>
	<p class="heading">Parameter estimate and error</p>
	<p>The 
		sample proportion of successes is denoted by <span class="em black">p</span>  and is an estimate of  <span class="black">π</span>.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/pEqn.gif" width="246" height="35"></p>
	<p>Since <span class="em black">p</span>  is based on a random sample, it varies from sample to sample and has a distribution. The estimation error is:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><em>error</em> = &nbsp; <em>p</em> - π</p>
	<p>Since <span class="black">π</span> is unknown, we never know the value of the error, but we can find its approximate <strong>distribution</strong>. This will allow us to assess the likely size of the error.</p>
