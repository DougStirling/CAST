<p class=heading>Interpretation of a confidence interval</p>
<p>95% confidence intervals for probabilities are interpreted in a similar way 
to those for population means.</p>
<p>In practice we cannot tell whether or not the confidence interval that we obtain 
actually includes the unknown population probability. However knowing that confidence 
intervals obtained in this way will <strong>usually</strong> include π 
is very helpful. In practice,...</p>

<p>Being right most of the time is the best one can hope for, since there is always
the possibility of being misled by an unlucky sample.</p>
</div></div>
<p>The <strong>method</strong> that we use to obtain the confidence interval has 
probability 0.95 of including π. 
We cannot tell whether the single interval that we evaluate from our data set 
is one of these 'lucky' intervals, but knowing that the <strong>method</strong> 
works so often gives us <strong>95% confidence</strong> in this interval.</p>

<p>The following data sets give examples of the calculations for obtaining 95% 
confidence intervals and the conclusions that we can draw from them.</p>
