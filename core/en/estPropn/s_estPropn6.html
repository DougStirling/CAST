<p>As with all other confidence intervals, a 95% confidence interval for a population proportion, π, is  random. Although it correctly includes π in 95% of random samples, there is a 5% probability that it will not include the true value of π.</p>
<p>The  simulation below took 100 random samples of size <em>n</em> = 200 from a population with π = 0.6. Most of the confidence intervals included π = 0.6, but some did not. If the simulation was repeated many more times, the proportion including 0.6 would be close to 0.95.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_ciSim.gif" width="550" height="299"></p>
<p>In practice, you only have a single sample and a single confidence interval, but we have &quot;95% confidence&quot; that it will include the true (and usually unknown) value of π.</p>
<p class="heading">Problems with small sample sizes</p>
<p>This confidence interval for π was based on a normal approximation to the distribution of the sample proportion. If the sample size, <em>n</em>, is small or π 
	is close to either 0 or 1, this normal approximation is inaccurate and the confidence level for the interval can be considerably less than 95%.</p>
<p>Many textbooks give the following 
	guideline for using the confidence interval:</p>
<div class="centred">
	<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" style="background-color:#FFFFFF; border:1px solid #999999;" class="centred">
		<tr>
			<td align="left"><strong>Only use the confidence interval for π 
				when <span class="red">all</span> of the following hold...</strong>
				<div class="centred">
					<table class="centred">
						<tr>
							<td align="center"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;30<br>
								<em>np</em>&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; 5<br>
								&nbsp;<em>n</em>(1-<em>p</em>)&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; 5</strong></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>These guidelines can be relaxed a little provided you accept that the confidence level may be a little less than 95%.</p>
