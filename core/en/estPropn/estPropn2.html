<p class="heading">Population proportions and probabilities</p>

<p>Categorical data are often obtained as a random sample from some finite population. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>A farmer might randomly sample 50 cabbages from a field and examine whether
each sampled cabbage is infested by caterpillars or other pests and diseases.</li>
	<li>A large company might randomly sample 100 or the invoices that were posted for services in the previous month and determine the proportion that were paid within 3 weeks.</li>
	<li>A national education department might randomly sample 60 high school teachers and ask them whether they had been verbally or physically abused by students in the previous year.</li>
</ul>
<p>We concentrate on a single category which we will call <strong>success</strong> and we collectively call the other categories <strong>failures</strong>. The 
population proportion of successes is denoted by π. It is also the <strong>probability</strong> that a single randomly selected value from the population is a success.</p>
<p>In other situations, categorical data are not physically sampled from a real population, but we can still consider them to be sampled from an underlying process in which the probability of success is π.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A restaurant introduces a new main course to its menu and records the number of diners choosing this dish. The probability that a diner will choose the new main course is π.</li>
	<li>A biologist sprays a weak concentration of insecticide on 50 beetles and determines the proportion still alive after 1 hour. The probability of this application killing a beetle is π.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not further distinguish between these two situations &mdash;  in both cases, we are interested in estimating an underlying probability, π. Although it is more general to treat π as a probability, it is  usually easier to interpret π as a 'population proportion'.</p>
<p class="heading">Parameter estimate and error</p>
<p>The 
	sample proportion of successes is denoted by <span class="em black">p</span>  and is an estimate of the population proportion, <span class="black">π</span>.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/pEqn.gif" width="246" height="35"></p>
<p>As in other situations in which a population parameter is estimated, there will 
	be an estimation error,</p>
<p class="eqn"><em>error</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>p</em> &minus; π</p>
<p>Since <span class="black">π</span> 
	is unknown, we cannot find a numerical value for the error, but we know that the error 
	has a distribution. In the next page, we will show how to find the error distribution.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Rice survey"> 
	<p class="heading">Rice survey</p>

	
	<p>As part of a survey of rice producers in Sri Lanka, 36 farmers were randomly 
		selected from 4 villages. Each sampled farmer was asked about the variety 
		of rice that he used and the varieties were categorised as 'Old', 'Traditional' 
		or 'New'. The 36 categorical values are described by the following frequency 
	table.</p>

		<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" class="centred">
			<tr>
				<th align="LEFT" bgcolor="white" style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-left:1px solid #999999;">Old varieties</th>
				<td align="RIGHT" bgcolor="white" style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="LEFT" bgcolor="white" style="border-left:1px solid #999999;">Traditional varieties</th>
				<td align="RIGHT" bgcolor="white" style="border-right:1px solid #999999;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="LEFT" bgcolor="white" style="border-left:1px solid #999999; border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">New varieties</th>
				<td align="RIGHT" bgcolor="white" style="border-right:1px solid #999999; border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">4</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="LEFT">Total&nbsp;farmers</th>
				<td align="RIGHT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36</td>
			</tr>
		</table></div>

	<p>We will concentrate here on the 'Old' varieties of rice. We want to estimate 
		the proportion of farmers in this part of Sri Lanka who use these old varieties 
		&mdash; the population parameter, π. 
		However we only have a small sample of farmers and our best estimate is 
		the sample proportion, <sup>17</sup>/<sub>36</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.472.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How accurate is this estimate?</p>
</div></div>

	<p>Since π is unknown here, the estimation error cannot be determined.</p>
	
	<p class=heading>Simulation: Error distribution</p>

	
	<p>The diagram below simulates preference data in which a sample of 100 people 
		say which of two types of coffee is preferred. The values could equally 
		be from any 'success/failure' binomial scenario.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="550" height="450">

</div>

		
	
	<p>Our sample of 100 values provides an estimate of the population proportion 
		preferring <em>Coffee A</em>, but the error cannot be found unless we know 
		the value of π.</p>
	<p>Since this is a simulation, we can 'cheat'. Click <strong>Peek at population</strong> 
		to see the population proportion preferring Coffee A and evaluate the estimation 
		error.</p>
	<p>Click <strong>Another sample</strong> several times to repeat the simulation 
		and build up the distribution of the estimation error. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The error distribution describes the 
						likely size of errors from this type of estimate.</p>
</div></div>

	
	<p>Note that this is <strong>not</strong> a practical way to obtain the error 
		distribution since we can rarely take multiple samples from the population. 
		However it does illustrate the concept of an error distribution.</p>
