<p class="heading">Sampling with and without replacement</p>

<p>In a random sample of size <i>n</i> from a finite population of <i>N</i> values, 
each population value has the same chance of being in the sample. There are two different ways to select such a sample.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'popSamp', 'replacement', '508', '414');</script>


<p>The statistical theory 
		for analysing samples that are taken with replacement (SWR) is also easier than for samples without replacement (SWOR), though this should not affect 
the sampling scheme that you use!</p>

<p class="heading">Practical differences</p>
<p>If the sample size, <i>n</i>, is much smaller than the population size, <i>N</i>, 
there is little practical difference between SWR and SWOR &mdash; there would be little 
chance of the same individual being picked twice in SWR.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When the population is large (and considerably larger than the sample 
size), SWR and SWOR are almost identical.</p>
