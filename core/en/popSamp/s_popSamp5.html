<p class="heading">Different sampling schemes</p>
	<p><strong>Two 
			different</strong> ways to collect a random sample of <em>n</em> values from a finite population of size <em>N</em> are common. In both sampling schemes, each population value has the same chance of being in the sample.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Sampling with replacement (SWR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWR, the first selected value is <strong>returned to the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from all <i>N</i> population values. </dd>
		<dt>Sampling without replacement (SWOR)</dt>
		<dd>In SWOR, the first selected value is <strong>removed from the population</strong> and the second value is randomly selected from the remaining <i>N</i> - 1 population 
		values, etc.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Since a SWR may contain the same population value more than once, it covers less of the population than SWOR. SWOR therefore gives more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Large populations and/or small samples</p>
	<p>If the sample size, <i>n</i>, is much smaller than the population size, <i>N</i>, 
		there is little practical difference between SWR and SWOR &mdash; there would be little 
		chance of the same individual being picked twice in SWR.</p>
