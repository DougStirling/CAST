<p class="heading notPrinted">Effect of sample size on sampling error</p>
	<p>The larger the sample size, the smaller the sampling error. However when the 
		population is large, sampling a small proportion of the population may still give 
		accurate estimates. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Sampling error depends much more strongly on the sample size than 
				on the proportion of the population that is sampled.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>For example, a sample of 10 from a population of 10,000 people will estimate 
		the proportion of males almost as accurately as a sample of size 10 from a population 
		of 100.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The cost savings from using a sample instead of a full census can 
				be huge.</p>
