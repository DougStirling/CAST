<p class="heading">Different sampling schemes</p>

<p>In a random sample of size <i>n</i> from a finite population of <i>N</i> values, 
each population value has the same chance of being in the sample. <strong>Two 
different</strong> types of random sample are common in practice. </p>

<p>Both sampling methods can be performed by sequentially selecting values until 
the required sample size is reached. They differ in how the second and subsequent 
values are selected.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Sampling with replacement (SWR)</strong></dt>
<dd>In SWR, the first selected value is <strong>returned to the population</strong> 
and the second value is randomly selected from all <i>N</i> population values. 
Values are selected in this way until there are <i>n</i> values in the sample. 
</dd>
</dl>
<br>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A sample with replacement can contain the <strong>same 
population value more than once</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<br>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Sampling without replacement (SWOR)</strong></dt>
<dd>In SWOR, the first selected value is <strong>removed from the population</strong> 
and the second value is randomly selected from the remaining <i>N</i> - 1 population 
values. Each selected value is removed and another selected from the remaining 
population values until there are <i>n</i> values in the sample. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Each possible subset of <i>n</i> values from the population has the same chance 
of being selected.</dd>
</dl>
<br>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Since no value can appear more than once in the sample, SWOR covers 
more of the population and gives <strong>more accurate estimates 
than SWR</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>However occasionally the sampled individuals cannot be removed from the population 
and SWR is necessary. An example would be a biologist who records characteristics 
of animals that are sighted within a region; there may be no way to tell whether 
a bird has already been spotted. <span class="gray">(The statistical theory 
for analysing SWR is also easier than for SWOR, though this should not affect 
the sampling scheme that you use!)</span></p>

<p class="heading">Practical differences</p>
<p>If the sample size, <i>n</i>, is much smaller than the population size, <i>N</i>, 
there is little practical difference between SWR and SWOR &mdash; there would be little 
chance of the same individual being picked twice in SWR.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When the population is large (and considerably larger than the sample 
size), SWR and SWOR are almost identical.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In particular, if the population size is infinite, SWR and SWOR are identical. 
</p>

<p class="heading">Illustration</p>

<p>The distinction between sampling with and without replacement is shown in the diagram below.
The values in the diagram are the weights (kg) of 49 rare ducks in a captive breeding programme.

</div>

<p>Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> to randomly select 5 of the 49 ducks
<strong>with replacement</strong>. Take a few more samples and observe that it is possible
to select the same duck twice or more.
</p>

<p>Use the pop-up menu to increase the sample size and select a few more random samples.
The bigger the sample size, the greater the chance of selecting the same duck two or
more times when sampling with replacement.
</p>

<p>Select the option <strong>Without replacement</strong>, then take a few more samples.
Since we can no longer select any duck more than once, the samples
cover more of the population.
