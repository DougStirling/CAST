<p class="heading">Census</p>
  
  <p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
    fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
    group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A researcher is interested in the wellfare of racehorses. Since all horses 
must be registered in order to race, the population of interest is all horses 
that are registered with the country's national racing association.</li>
<li>A grower of hydroponic lettuces produces about 1,200 lettuce heads each day. 
As part of the quality control process, it is important to monitor the size and 
condition of the plants at harvest (after 35 days). In any day, the population 
of interest consists of all heads of lettuce harvested that day.</li></ul>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When measurements are made from every item in the target population, the collected
data are called a <strong>census</strong>.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Sampling from the population</p>
	
  <p>A census is often not feasible: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The cost and time required to record information from every unit in a 
      large population can be immense.</li>
    
<li>Recording some variables destroys the units. For example, testing the resitance 
of apples to bruising leaves them damaged.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>Fortunately, we can often obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
measuring a selection of units from the population.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data from a subset of the population is called a <strong>sample</strong>.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample from a population is called 
    a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In this, each unit has the same chance 
    of being selected and some random mechanism (e.g. tossing a coin, rolling 
    a die or a computer-based method) is used to determine whether any particular 
    unit is included in the sample.</p>
  <p>Although there is some inaccuracy when a sample is used instead of the whole 
    population, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this. </p>
		
  <p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	
  
<p>When only a single measurement is made from each individual, it is convenient 
to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>
  
<p>In the remainder of this chapter, we examine the consequences of sampling from 
populations of numerical and categorical values.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Sampling people and apples"> 
<p class="heading">Sampling people</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the sampling process with a population of 
	56 people. </p>

</applet> 
</div>

<p>Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> to randomly select 15 of these 
people. Repeat a few times to observe the variability in the units sampled.</p>
	
    <p>Although there are many differences between the individuals, we are often 
      only interested in one. Click the checkbox <strong>Only show Gender</strong> 
      to concentrate on this aspect of the individuals; the population is a set 
      of categorical values (Male or Female) and the sample is similarly categorical.</p>
    <p>Similar categorical populations and samples would arise if we were interested 
      in whether the people were married, intended to vote for a particular candidate 
      or were unemployed.</p>
    
<p class="heading">Sampling apples</p>
    
<p>The diagram below respresents the 120 apples that one fruit-picker collected 
from an orchard in an hour. The apples have a variety of shapes and sizes (represented 
by different colours in the diagram), and some are bruised or blemished (marked 
with a cross).</p>
<div class="centred"> 
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="500" height="350">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="designProg.PictSamplingApplet">
<param name="catVarName" value="Apple condition">
<param name="catLabels" value="Bruised OK">
<param name="sampling" value="15 8274476">

<param name="pictureType" value="apple">
<param name="customText" value="Only show=Only show">
</applet> 
</div>

    
<p>Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> to randomly select 17 apples.</p>
    
<p>Click <strong>Only show Apple condition</strong> to concentrate on whether 
the apples are damaged. As with the previous example, this reduces the problem 
to random sampling from a population of categorical values (Bruised or OK). </p>
