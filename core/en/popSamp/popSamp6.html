<p class="heading">Selecting a sample manually (raffle tickets)</p>

<p>When choosing a random sample, each population member must have the same chance 
of being included in the sample. How can we select a random sample in practice? 
One method of selecting a random sample of size <em>n</em> is...</p>
<ol>
<li>Write the names (or other identification) of all population members on identical 
pieces of paper,</li>
<li>Mix them thoroughly in a box</li>
<li>Select <em>n</em> pieces of paper (with or without replacement).</li>
</ol>

<p>This method is often used for raffles, but thorough mixing is difficult  for large populations and it is rarely used in research applications.</p>
<p class="heading">Random digits</p>
<p>An alternative method of selecting a random sample involves generating random 
digits (0, 1, ..., 9). There are several ways to generate random digits such that 
each has the same chance of appearing.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding-bottom:0px; padding-top:0px"><tr>
<td><ul style="margin-left:10px; margin-top:0px;"><li>Roll a 10-sided 
die several times. (6-sided dice are more common, but 10-sided dice are also used 
in various games &mdash; especially fantasy games.)</li>
<li>Books of random digits have been published. Open a page at random then use 
a sequence of digits starting from an arbitrary position on the page.</li>
<li>Some computer programs (e.g. Microsoft Excel) contain functions that generate 
random numbers. (Computer-generated values should strictly be called <em>pseudo-random 
numbers</em>, but the distinction is not important here.)</li>
<li>Many calculators have a 'random number' key that generates (pseudo-) random numbers.</li>
</ul></td>
<td valign="top" style="padding-left:12px;"><img src="../popSamp/images/die.png" width="150" height="123"></td>
</tr></table>

<p>Concatenating 2 or more of these random digits gives a larger random number.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Generating random numbers"> 
<p>Click the button <strong>Generate digit</strong> to generate a random digit.</p>

<div class="centred">

<p>Concatenating three such random digits gives a random number between 0 and 999.
Click <strong>Generate value</strong> to find a random number in this range.</p>

<p class="heading">Random number between 0 and <em>k</em></p>

<p>A random number that is equally likely to be any number between 0 and 357 can be found by repeatedly generating 3-digit numbers (between 0 and 999) until a value between 0 and 357 is obtained.</p>
<p>It is easier however to use a spreadsheet such as Excel &mdash; it has a function designed for this purpose, &quot;=RANDBEWEEN(0, 357)&quot;.</p>
<p class="heading">Selecting a random sample</p>
<p>To select a random sample without replacement using random numbers,</p>

<ol>
<li>Number all population members, starting from index 0.</li>
		<li>Generate a random value between 0 and the largest population index.</li>
<li>If sampling <strong>without</strong> replacement and the generated index has already been selected, go back to step 2 and select another index.<br>
</li>
<li>Add the selected population member to the sample, then repeat steps 2. and 3. until a large enough sample has been selected.</li>
</ol>


<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Selecting a random sample without replacement"> 
<p>The diagram below illustrates sampling without replacement from a population 
of 56 individuals. They have been numbered from 0 to 55.</p>

</div>

<p>Click <strong>Random index</strong>. If the resulting two digits are between 
0 and 55, the corresponding individual is added to the sample. Otherwise, an error 
message appears and a new random value must be generated.</p>
<p>Repeat several times to add more individuals to the sample. Note that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Almost half of the values initially generated are rejected because they are outside the 
range 0 to 55. These rejections would have been avoided if the Excel function &quot;=RANDBETWEEN(0, 55)&quot; had been used instead of initially generating values between 0 and 99.</li>
<li>Occasionally a population member is selected that is already in the sample 
&mdash; it cannot be added twice. This happens more often as the sample size increases.</li>
</ul>
