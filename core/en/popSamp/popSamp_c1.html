<p class="heading">Census</p>
  
  <p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
    fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
    group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a company declares itself bankrupt, an official receiver is appointed 
to oversee the affairs of the company. One important aspect of this is to check 
the recent financial dealings of the company. All invoices that were sent out 
in the previous year might be one population of interest.</li>
<li>A manufacturer of breakfast cereals produces about 30,000 boxes of corn flakes 
each day. As part of the quality control process, it is important to monitor defects 
in each day's output. In a day's production, how many boxes are underweight or 
have defective packaging? The population of interest consists of all boxes produced 
in the day.</li></ul>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When measurements are made from every item in the target population, 
the collected data are called a <strong>census</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Sampling from the population</p>
	
  <p>A census is often not feasible: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The cost and time required to record information from every unit in a 
      large population can be immense.</li>
    <li>Recording some variables destroys the units. For example, testing the 
      strength of seatbelts leaves them damaged.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>Fortunately, we can often obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
measuring a selection of units from the population.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data from a subset of the population is called a <strong>sample</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample from a population is called 
    a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In this, each unit has the same chance 
    of being selected and some random mechanism (e.g. tossing a coin, rolling 
    a die or a computer-based method) is used to determine whether any particular 
    unit is included in the sample.</p>
  <p>Although there is some inaccuracy when a sample is used instead of the whole 
    population, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this. </p>
		
  <p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	
  
<p>When only a single measurement is made from each individual, it is convenient 
to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>
  
<p>In the remainder of this chapter, we examine the consequences of sampling from 
populations of numerical and categorical values.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Sampling people and luggage">
<p class="heading">Sampling people</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the sampling process with a population of 
	56 people. </p>

</applet> 
</div>

<p>Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> to randomly select 15 of these 
people. Repeat a few times to observe the variability in the units sampled.</p>
	
    <p>Although there are many differences between the individuals, we are often 
      only interested in one. Click the checkbox <strong>Only show Gender</strong> 
      to concentrate on this aspect of the individuals; the population is a set 
      of categorical values (Male or Female) and the sample is similarly categorical.</p>
    <p>Similar categorical populations and samples would arise if we were interested 
      in whether the people were married, intended to vote for a particular candidate 
      or were unemployed.</p>
    <p class="heading">Sampling luggage</p>
    <p>The diagram below shows 90 pieces of luggage that were unloaded from the baggage hold of a plane. There are various different styles, sizes, weights and colours of bag. Some, marked with a red cross, are damaged (though the damage was probably not caused by this particular flight).</p>
    <div class="centred"> 
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="530" height="340">

</applet> 
</div>

    <p>Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> to randomly select 15 bags.</p>
    <p>Click <strong>Only show Bag state</strong> to concentrate on whether the 
      bags are damaged. As with the previous example, this reduces the problem 
      to random sampling from a population of categorical values (Damaged or 
      OK). </p>
