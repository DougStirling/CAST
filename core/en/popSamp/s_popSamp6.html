<p class="heading">Selecting a sample manually (raffle tickets)</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Write the names (or other identification) of all population members on identical 
			pieces of paper,</li>
		<li>Mix them thoroughly in a box</li>
		<li>Select <em>n</em> pieces of paper (with or without replacement).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This method is  rarely used in research applications.</p>
	<p class="heading">Selecting a  sample with random numbers</p>
	<p>To select a random sample without replacement using random numbers,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Number all population members, starting from index 0.</li>
		<li>Generate a random index between 0 and the largest population index.</li>
		<li>If sampling <strong>without</strong> replacement and the generated index has already been selected, go back to step 2 and select another index.<br>
		</li>
		<li>Add the selected population member to the sample, then repeat steps 2. and 3. until a large enough sample has been selected.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="heading">Random number between 0 and <em>k</em></p>
	<p>The easiest way to generate a random number between 0 and 357 is to use a spreadsheet such as Excel &mdash; it has a function designed for this purpose, &quot;=RANDBETWEEN(0, 357)&quot;. A computer-generated random value is strictly called a <em>pseudo-random</em> number.</p>
	<p>If a computer is not available, a sequence of random digits can be generated:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px;"><tr>
<td>
	<ul>
		<li>Roll a 10-sided die several times.</li>
		<li>In a printed book of random digits, start at a random position in a random page, then use 
			a sequence of digits starting from there.</li>
	</ul></td>
<td style="padding-left:12px;"><img src="../popSamp/images/die.png" width="150" height="123"></td>
</tr></table>

	<p>A random number that is equally likely to have any value between 0 and 357 can be found by repeatedly generating 3-digit numbers (between 0 and 999) until a value between 0 and 357 is obtained.</p>
