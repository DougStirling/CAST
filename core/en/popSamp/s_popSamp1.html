<p class="heading">Population and census</p>
	<p>We often want to find information about a particular group of individuals (people, 
		fields, trees, bottles of beer or some other collection of items). This target 
		group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
	<p>Collecting measurements  from every item in the  population is called a <strong>census</strong>. A census is rarely feasible,  because of the  cost and time involved.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simple random sample</p>
	<p>We can usually obtain sufficiently accurate information by only 
	collecting information from a selection of units from the population &mdash; a <strong>sample</strong>. Although a sample gives less accurate information than a census, the savings in cost and time often outweigh this.</p>
	<p>The simplest way to select a representative sample  is  
		a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. In it, each unit has the same chance 
		of being selected and some random mechanism is used to determine whether any particular unit is 
		included in the sample.	</p>
	<p class="heading">Sampling from a population of <span class="red">values</span></p>
	<p>It is convenient 
		to define the population and sample to be sets of <strong>values</strong> (rather 
		than people or other items). This abstraction &mdash; a population of values and a 
		corresponding sample of values &mdash; can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>
