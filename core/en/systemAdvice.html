	<p>You should next start a Java program that is part of the downloaded installation of Java; it can be found in the folder "CAST/core/java" and is called "coreCAST.jar". Double-clicking should start this program. It can be used to display CAST's interactive material and associated usage instructions.
	</p>

<p class="heading">Usage</p>
	
	<p>Firstly select this e-book from the pop-up menu that is displayed. <strong>After a short delay</strong>, a window should appear with pop-up menus to let you select a chapter, section and page within the e-book. The browser pages in the main CAST e-book will direct you to the appropriate diagrams in this program for study.</p>
</div>

<div class="remoteSite">
	<p>Unfortunately the Java program that is needed to run the interactive diagrams in CAST will currently not work when CAST is used from a remote web site. You should download and install CAST for use on a <strong>local</strong> hard disk or server.

<!--
	<p>Click <a href="../java/startAppletProgram.jnlp">this link</a> to download a small "Java Network Launch Protocol" file that provides the link for starting the Java program. Your browser may well give you a warning before downloading the file, but you will need to allow it. This will save a file called "startAppletProgram.jnlp" in your Downloads folder. Double-clicking this file should download the Java program that displays the diagrams to your hard disk and start to run it. (The program will be cached on your computer so starting it should be faster in future but you will still need to use the "JNLP" file to start it.)</p>
