<p class="heading notPrinted">Units and strength of a relationship</p>
	<p>A numerical summary of the strength of the relationship between two variables
should not depend on the units in which we measure the two variables. The strength
of the two relationships between Sales (of ice cream) and Temperature are
the same in both of the scatterplots below.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_units_c.gif" width="550" height="219"></p>
	<p>We therefore start by defining <strong>units-free</strong> versions of the two variables and will summarise the strength of the relationship in terms of them.</p>
