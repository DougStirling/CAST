<p class="heading">Problems with correlation</p>
  
<p>The correlation coefficient, <em>r</em>, is a good summary of the strength 
of the relationship between two variables if their scatterplot is an elliptical 
cloud of points.</p>
<p>If the relationship is nonlinear, the correlation coefficient understates the 
strength of the relationship. On the other hand, an outlier can strongly influence 
<em>r</em> and may potentially make the relationship appear stronger than is justified 
by the remaining points. If there are clusters, the overall correlation coefficient 
may be very different from the correlation within each cluster.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p> The following exercise presents four scatterplots with different features 
and different correlations. Drag the four correlation coefficients that are shown 
under the scatterplots so that each correlation coefficient matches the scatterplot 
above it.</p>
