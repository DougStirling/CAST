<p class=heading>Generalising from data</p>

<p>Most data sets do <strong>not</strong> arise from randomly sampling individuals from a finite population. However we are still rarely interested in the specific individuals from whom data 
  were collected.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The recorded data are often 'representative' of something 
        more general.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The main aim  is to <strong>generalise from the data</strong>.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 

<p class=heading>Examples</p>
		<p>The following data sets were collected to provide information about something 
			more general than the specific 'individuals' from whom the values were collected.</p>
<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeImage('image', this)">
<option value="0" selected>Silkworm larva survival (sec)</option>
<option value="1">Yam growth (cm per week)</option>
<option value="2">Mammal thigh bone shape</option>
<option value="3">Apple tree growth (cubic cm)</option>
<option value="4">PSA</option>
</select>
</form>

</div>


  <p>We can (and should!)  use exploratory graphical and numerical summaries 
		to help understand the distribution of values in data sets such as these. 
	However the data give <strong>incomplete</strong> information about the underlying process &mdash; with more data, we would be able to do better.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
    <p>We need to explain more precisely what is meant by  'generalising from the data'.</p>
