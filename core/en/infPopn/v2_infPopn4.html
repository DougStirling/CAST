<p class=heading>Distributions</p>
<p>The abstract population that we imagine to underlie a data set usually contains
an infinite number of values. For example, the lifetimes of 40 tested light bulbs
might be modelled as a sample from a population in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>The population contains <strong>all</strong> values greater than zero, since
any positive failure time is <strong>possible</strong>.</li>
<li>Some values are more likely than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of underlying population is called a <strong>distribution</strong>.</p>

<p class=heading>Location of cows in a field</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'infPopn', 'cowLocation', '444', '432');</script>
	
<p>In this illustration, we assumed that all possible locations in the field were equally likely. The idea of a distribution also allows for some possible values to be more likely than others. For example, the cow may be more likely to be in some parts of the field above than others.</p>
