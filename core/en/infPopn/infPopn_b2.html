<p class=heading>Randomness of data</p>

  <p>Not only do we usually have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data were collected, but we must also acknowledge that our data would have been different if, by chance, we had selected different individuals or even made our measurements at a different time.</p>
  <p>We must acknowledge 
    this sample-to-sample variability when interpreting the data. The data are <strong>random</strong>.</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>All graphical and numerical summaries would 
          be different if we repeated data collection.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>This randomness in the data must be taken into account when we interpret graphical and numerical summaries. Our conclusions should not be dependent on features  that are specific to our particular data but would (probably) be different if the data were collected again.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Survival of silk worms after poisoning"> 
	  <p class=heading>Survival of silkworms</p>

		<p>Silkworm larvae must be killed after spinning their cocoons since the silk 
			is damaged when they later emerge. In an experiment to help understand the 
			toxicity of sodium arsenate to silkworm larvae, survival times of 10 fourth-instar 
			silkworm larvae were recorded after being given 0.1 mg of sodium arsenate 
			per gram of body weight.</p>

		<p>The results again depend on the specific larvae used. Click <strong>Repeat 
			experiment with 80 different larvae </strong>to see how the results might 
			change if the data were collected again.</p>
		<p>If the experiment was repeated with a different sample of silkworm larvae, different values would be obtained. Click <strong>Repeat 
		    experiment with 10 different larvae</strong> to see how the recorded data 
		  might change.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The dot plot, mean and standard deviation 
            all vary considerably.</p>
</div></div>

		<p>The results from a single experiment clearly tell us <strong>something</strong> about survival of larvae when given this amount of poison, but how do we take into consideration 
		  the randomness?</p>
		<p>Use the pop-up menu to increase the sample size and repeat.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>With a bigger data set, the dot plot, mean 
            and standard deviation vary less between the different data sets.</p>
