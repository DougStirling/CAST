<p class=heading>Data that are <span class="red">not</span> sampled from a finite population</p>
	<p>There is   no real finite population underlying most data sets   from which the values can be treated 
		as being sampled. The randomness in such data must be explained in a different way.</p>
	<p class=heading>Sampling from an abstract  population</p>
	<p>&quot;Random sampling from a population&quot; is  also used to explain variability even when there is no <strong>real</strong> finite population from which the data were sampled.</p>
	<p>We imagine an <strong>abstract</strong> population of <strong>all values that might have been obtained</strong> if the data collection had been repeated. We can then treat the observed data as a random sample from this abstract population.</p>
	<p>Defining such an underlying population therefore not only explains sample-to-sample variability but also gives us a focus for generalising from  our specific data.</p>
