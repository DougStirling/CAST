<p class=heading>Data that are <span class="red">not</span> sampled from a finite population</p>
<p>Sometimes  data are actually sampled from a real finite population. For example, 
  a public opinion poll may select individuals from the population of all residents 
  in a city. The previous section showed that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>Random sampling of values from a finite population can explain the sample-to-sample variability of <strong>some</strong> data.</p>
</div></div>
<p>However there is   no real finite population underlying most data sets   from which the values can be treated 
as being sampled. The randomness in such data must be explained in a different way.</p>

  <p class=heading>Estimating the speed of light</p>
  <p>A scientist, Simon Newcomb, made a series of measurements of the speed of light between July and September 1882. He measured the time in nanoseconds (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>1,000,000,000</sub> seconds) that a light signal took to pass from his laboratory on the Potomac River to a mirror at the base of the Washington Monument and back, a total distance of 7442 metres. <span class="gray">Since all his measurements (24828, 24826, ...)
    were close to 24800, they have been coded in the table below as
    (24828-24800&nbsp;=&nbsp;28, 24826-24800&nbsp;=&nbsp;26,&nbsp;...)</span></p>

  <p>Newcomb's measurements cannot be 
    considered to be sampled from any real finite population. However there is variability within this data set that reflects inaccuracies in his experimental procedure. Repeating his experiment would have resulted in a different set of measurements. </p>
</div>
<p class=heading>Sampling from an abstract  population</p>
<p>Random sampling from a population is such an intuitive way to explain sample-to-sample variability, we also use it to explain variability even when there is no <strong>real</strong> population from which the data were sampled.</p>
<p>We replace the real population that usually underlies survey data  with an <strong>abstract</strong> population of <strong>all values that might have been obtained</strong> if the data collection had been repeated. We can then treat the observed data as a random sample from this abstract population.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>The variation in the underlying abstract population gives us information about the variation in similar data <strong>in general</strong>.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Defining such an underlying population therefore not only explains sample-to-sample variability but also gives us a focus for generalising from  our specific data.</p>
<div class="diagram">
<p class=heading>Estimating the speed of light</p>
<p>Newcomb's data can be treated as a sample from 
	the  population of <strong>all possible measurements</strong> that could 
	have been made by repeating the experiment an infinite number of times.</p>
<p>The variability 
	in this abstract population reflects the variability in Newcomb's experimental 
	technique. The desire to generalise from Newcomb's specific 66 measurements  can therefore be translated into estimation of characteristics of the underlying population (and hence the true speed of light).</p>
<p>Newcomb's data can be treated as a random sample from this population and they provide information 
	about the distribution of values in it.</p>
