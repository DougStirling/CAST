<p class="heading">Sampling from a population</p>
	<p>Sampling from an underlying population (whether finite or infinite) gives us a mechanism to explain the randomness of data. The underlying population also gives us a <strong>focus</strong> for generalising from our sample data &mdash; the distribution of values in the population is fixed and does not depend on the specific sample data.</p>
	<p class="heading">Unknown population</p>
	<p>Unfortunately the population underlying most data sets is unknown and, in practice, we only have a <strong>single sample</strong>. However this single sample does throw light on the population distribution.</p>
	<p>The diagram below describes a sample from a categorical distribution. Although the underlying population is unknown, the sample proportion of successes, <em>p</em>, is an <strong>estimate</strong> of the unknown proportions of successes in the population (denoted by Ï€).</p>
