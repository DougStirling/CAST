<p class=heading>Randomness of data</p>

  <p>Not only do we usually have little interest in the specific individuals from whom data were collected, but we must also acknowledge that our data would have been different if, by chance, we had selected different individuals or even made our measurements at a different time.</p>
  <p>We must acknowledge 
		this sample-to-sample variability when interpreting the data. The data are 
		<strong>random</strong>.</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>All graphical and numerical summaries would 
					be different if we repeated data collection.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>This randomness in the data must be taken into account when we interpret graphical and numerical summaries. Our conclusions should not be dependent on features  that are specific to our particular data but would (probably) be different if the data were collected again.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Hardness of brick pavers"> 
		<p class=heading>Hardness of brick pavers</p>

		<p>In an experiment to assess the durability of one type of brick pavers, 
			a sharpened drill impacted the surface of 10 pavers for a period of 1 minute. 
			The volume of material eroded (mL) was recorded.</p>

	<p>If the experiment was repeated with a different sample of brick pavers 
		of the same type, different values would be obtained. Click <strong>Repeat 
		experiment with 10 different pavers</strong> to see how the recorded data 
		might change.</p>

	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The dot plot, mean and standard deviation 
					all vary considerably.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The results from a single experiment clearly tell us <strong>something</strong> 
		about the hardness of this type of paver, but how do we take into consideration 
		the randomness?</p>
	<p>Use the pop-up menu to increase the sample size and repeat.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>With a bigger data set, the dot plot, mean 
					and standard deviation vary less between the different data sets.</p>
