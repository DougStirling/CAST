<p class=heading>Data that are <span class="red">not</span> sampled from a finite population</p>
<p>Sometimes  data are actually sampled from a real finite population. For example, 
  a public opinion poll may select individuals from the population of all residents 
  in a city. The previous section showed that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>Random sampling of values from a finite population can explain the sample-to-sample variability of <strong>some</strong> data.</p>
</div></div>
<p>However there is   no real finite population underlying most data sets   from which the values can be treated 
as being sampled. The randomness in such data must be explained in a different way.</p>

<p class=heading>Accidents in a factory</p>

<p>In a large factory, the management are concerned about their liability for 
accidents that occur on the factory floor. The following 
numbers of accidents were recorded each week over a 50-week period.</p>

<p>There is no real finite population from which these data can be considered 
to be sampled. However there is variability within this data set and operating 
the factory for another 50 weeks would result in a different set of measurements.

<p class="heading">Sampling from an abstract  population</p>
<p>Random sampling from a population is such an intuitive way to explain sample-to-sample variability, we also use it to explain variability even when there is no <strong>real</strong> population from which the data were sampled.</p>
<p>We replace the real population that usually underlies survey data  with an <strong>abstract</strong> population of <strong>all values that might have been obtained</strong> if the data collection had been repeated. We can then treat the observed data as a random sample from this abstract population.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>The variation in the underlying abstract population gives us information about the variation in similar data <strong>in general</strong>.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Defining such an underlying population therefore not only explains sample-to-sample variability but also gives us a focus for generalising from  our specific data.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Accidents in a factory</p>

<p>It is convenient to model the variability in the data as being a sample from 
the infinite population of <strong>all possible numbers of accidents</strong> 
that could have been observed. The variability in this hypothetical population 
reflects the variability in the occurrence of accidents.</p>
    <p>The distribution of accidents in the sample of 50 weeks provides information 
      about the distribution of this underlying population &mdash; the distribution 
      of accidents in this type of factory <strong>in general</strong>.</p>
