<p class=heading>Distributions</p>
	<p>When an abstract population is imagined to underlie a data set, it  often
contains an infinite number of values. For example, consider the lifetimes of
a sample of light bulbs. The population of <strong>possible</strong> failure
times contains <strong>all</strong> values greater than zero, and this includes
an infinite number of values. Moreover, some of these possible values will be
more likely than others.</p>
	<p>This kind of underlying population is called a <strong>distribution</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading>Positions of cow in a field</p>
	<p>Consider the positions of a cow in a field at 6 different times where all locations are equally likely.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_cows.gif" width="400" height="377"></p>
	<p>The population here contains all possible positions and is therefore infinite.</p>
	<p>The idea of a distribution also allows for some possible values to be more likely than others &mdash; the cow may be more likely to be in some particular part of the field.</p>
