<p class=heading>Superimposing histograms</p>
	<p>To compare the distributions in two groups of values (e.g. measurements for males and females), histograms for the two groups can be superimposed on the same axes.</p>
	<p>Colour or shading should be used to help distinguish 
	  the two histograms &mdash; in ordinary black-and-white histograms it can 
	  be difficult to tell which lines belong to which histograms.</p>
	<p class=heading>Relative frequencies to compare two groups</p>
	<p>If the number of values in the two groups differ, when two standard histograms are drawn against a common frequency axis, one histogram can be much smaller than the other. This makes the two distributions much harder to compare.</p>
	<p>The solution is to 
    make each rectangle height equal to the <strong>proportion</strong> in that 
    class instead of the class frequency. These proportions are also called the 
    <strong>relative frequencies</strong> in the classes.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
    <p>Use relative frequency histograms to compare groups.</p>
  </div></div>
	<p>An individual relative frequency histogram has the same shape as the corresponding frequency 
		histogram &mdash; each bar height is simply divided by the total number of observations 
		which rescales the histogram height. However using relative frequencies allows 
		us to make more meaningful comparisons between the distributions of different 
		groups.</p>
		
<div class="diagram" title="Example: Pull strength of soldered pins">
	<p class=heading>Pull strength of soldered pins</p>

		<p>In an evaluation of solder joints on printed circuit boards, 48 pins were 
			soldered on the left side of circuit boards and a further 16 pins were soldered 
			on the right side. The force (in pounds) required to pull each pin from 
			its board after a period of 'environmental conditioning' was determined. 
			The two histograms below show the two distributions of pin strengths.</p>

		<p>The area of the histogram for the left pin strengths is three times that 
			for right pin strengths (since there were three times the number of pins 
			soldered on the left) and this makes comparisons a little harder.</p>
		<p>Select <strong>Relative frequency</strong> from the pop-up menu to scale 
      both histograms to have the same area.</p>
		<p>It is easier to compare the relative frequency histograms. For example, 
			we can now determine visually that a higher proportion of right pins have 
			strengths between 55 and 60 than the corresponding proportion of left pins</p>

	<p class=heading>Population pyramids</p>
	<p>When two groups are to be compared, an alternative to superimposition is 
		to draw their two histograms back-to-back (in a similar way to back-to-back 
		stem and leaf plots). </p>
	<p>When used to compare age distributions of males and females in a population, 
		these back-to-back histograms are called <strong>population pyramids</strong> 
		&mdash; a common tool in demography. </p>
	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p>The population pyramids below show the age distributions of New Zealanders 
			of European and Maori descent in 1989.</p>
		<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="images/popnPyramids.gif" width="673" height="330"></div>
		<p>Since the two ethnic groups are of different sizes, relative frequency 
			(in the form of a percentage) is used rather than frequency, permitting 
			easier comparison of the groups. Note that...</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Maori population pyramid has a wider base than 
				that of the Europeans, indicating high birth rates and a relatively youthful 
				population.</li>
	    <li>In the population pyramid for those of European descent, a bigger proportion of females than males is older than 65.</li>
</ul>
