<p>When the vertical axis is 'frequency', the histogram for the 'stayers' has almost 5 times the area of the 'movers' histogram since there were almost 5 times the number of stayers as movers.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Relative frequency</strong> from the pop-up menu. This standardises the two histograms to make their areas equal and therefore makes it easier to compare the distributions.</p>

<div class="lecturerNote" id="dataNote">
<p>Merchandise buyers are critically important to the success or failure of retail ventures, both through negotiations over pricing and decisions about the types of product that will be stocked. Because of high turnover of staff in this area (estimated to be over 25 percent per year), research was carried out to determine the factors related to turnover. The researchers contacted merchandise buyers in several stores and asked them to complete a questionnaire. After 9 months, the researchers determined whether the buyers were in the same job &mdash; a classification into 'leavers' and 'stayers'.</p>
<p>The two histograms below describe the job satisfaction ratings of the two groups at the time of the questionnaire, on a scale of 0 (worst) to 30 (best).</p>
<p>On average, the stayers have slightly higher job satisfaction than the leavers (though there is considerable overlap in the distributions).</p>
