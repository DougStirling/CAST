<p class="heading">Warning about over-interpreting histograms of small data sets</p>
	<p>Adjusting the class width and the starting position for the first class can 
	  give a <strong>surprising amount of variability in histogram shape</strong> for small data sets. As a result, you must be extremely wary of over-interpreting features 
	  such as clusters or skewness in such histograms.</p>
	<p>Indeed, it is probably better to avoid using histograms to display small data sets &mdash; stacked dot plots are far less likely to mislead you over minor features.</p>

		<p>The histogram below shows the distribution of times taken to deal with 
			20 emailed technical support queries about an accounting program.</p>

		<p>Use the buttons under the histogram to adjust the class width and to shift 
			the histogram classes to the <strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong>. Note that the appearance of 
			splitting into clusters is only apparent in some of the histograms, but 
			not in others.</p>
		

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Are the clusters real, or are they just an artifact 
		of our choice of classes? </p>
</div></div>

<p>Without further supporting evidence, the clusters are not pronounced enough 
for us to conclude that the emailed queries must form into two meaningful groups. 
However they do give an indication of clustering that a good 'data detective' 
would investigate further.</p>
<p>In this data set, the clusters did correspond largely to two different types 
			of query (from new users and from experienced users).</p>
	</div>
	
<p>Because the shape of a small data set's histogram is so dependent of the 
choice of classes,...</p>
	

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Dot plots or stem &amp; leaf plots should be used in preference to histograms 
		for small data sets. </p>
</div></div>

<p>Dot plots and stem &amp; leaf plots show the size of the data set more clearly and hence give some warning 
about the risk of over-interpretation.
