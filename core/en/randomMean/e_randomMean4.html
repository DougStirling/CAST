<p>Both the mean and sum of values in a random sample have approximately normal 
distributions, provided the population distribution is reasonably symmetric or 
the sample size is large. Probabilities about means and sums can therefore be 
translated into probabilities relating to the standard normal distribution using 
z-scores and evaluated as areas under the standard normal density.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>Read the following question carefully to identify whether the probability relates 
to a sample mean, the total of the sample values or a single sample value. The 
templates on the left can be used to help evaluate the parameters of the approximate 
normal distribution of a sample mean or total. Then use the templates on the right 
to evaluate z-scores and drag over the standard normal normal density to find 
the required probability.</p>

<p>Repeat with a few different questions until you are confident with the method.
