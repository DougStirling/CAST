<p>The following exercise examines your understanding of how increasing sample 
size affects the shape of the distribution of sample means and standard deviations 
from skew and bimodal distributions.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>Four distributions are shown on the right below; they describe the distributions 
of the sum or mean of values in samples of different sizes from the same population. 
From their shapes, you should be able to match them to the sample sizes on the 
left. </p>

<p>Repeat with a few different questions. </p>
