<p>For samples from a normal population, both the sample mean and the total of 
the sample values have normal distributions. However their standard deviations 
depend on the sample size.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p>Four distributions are shown on the right below; they describe the distributions 
of the sum or mean of values in samples of different sizes from the same normal 
population. Use the spreads of these distributions to match them to the sample 
sizes on the left.</p>
<p>(Since the population mean is zero in this exercise, both the sample mean and 
sample total have distributions whose mean is zero.)</p>
