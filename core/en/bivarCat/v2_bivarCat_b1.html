<p class="heading">Groups and explanatory variables</p>
  
<p>It was <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('structures3')">explained earlier</a> that  data from different groups can be combined in a single data matrix with a categorical variable that gives group membership. In a similar way, a categorical variable can be used to split a data set into groups.</p>
<p>In some data sets,   one categorical variable can be thought of as a <strong>response</strong> whose values are thought to depend on a second categorical variable &mdash; an <strong>explanatory </strong>variable. We can then  think of the explanatory variable as defining different groups and ask how the response distribution differs between the groups.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>Do not  use the response variable to define the groups.</p>
</div></div>
<p>If one categorical variable is a response and the other is an explanatory variable, the methods in the previous section can be used to see how the explanatory variable affects the response.</p>

  <p class="heading">Bivariate data without an explanatory variable</p>
  <p>Not all data sets have  variables that can be categorised as a response and an explanatory variable. Sometimes the relationship between the variables 
    is more symmetrical but we still want to discover whether particular values of one variable are <strong>associated</strong> with values of the other.</p>
  <p>For numerical variables, we would use a correlation coefficient to describe the strength of the relationship (as opposed to least squares for variables that can be classified as a response and explanatory variable). When the two variables are categorical, different methods are needed to describe the association between the variables.</p>

    <p>The remainder of this section describes some methods of analysing data of this 
form.</p>
