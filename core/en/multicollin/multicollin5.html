<p class="heading">Tests for the slope parameters</p>
  <p>In earlier sections of this chapter we have described two different types 
		of test for whether the slope parameters associated with <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em> 
		are zero &mdash; t-tests for the individual parameters and a combined F-test for 
		them both.</p>
	<p>It is important to understand the difference between these two types of test.</p>
	<p class="heading">T-tests</p>
	<p>These are separate tests for the two slope parameters, each of which asks 
		whether one slope parameter is zero. These tests both refer to the full model,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="../regnInfTwo/images/normModelTwo2.gif" width="418" height="21"></p>
	<p>For example, the t-test for the slope parameter associated with <em>X</em> 
		is comparing the hypotheses:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tHypotheses.gif" width="87" height="43"></p>
	<p>These hypotheses equivalently compare the two models:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tHypotheses2.gif" width="250" height="43"></p>
	<p>Each t-test therefore asks about dropping a single variable from the full 
		model but:</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The two t-tests <strong> 
						do not give information about whether both variables might be dropped</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">F-test</p>
	<p>On the other hand, the F-test simultaneously asks whether both parameters 
		are zero:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/fHypotheses.gif" width="223" height="43"></p>
	<p>This is equivalent to comparison of the two models:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/fHypotheses2.gif" width="250" height="43"></p>
	<p>The F-test therefore assesses whether both variables can be dropped together, 
		but:</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The F-test <strong>gives 
						no information about whether dropping a single variable (but not the 
						other) is reasonable</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">For multicollinear data</p>
	<p>When the two explanatory variables are highly correlated, it is relatively 
		hard to disentangle their effect on the response. It may be found that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Neither explanatory variable improves the fit of the model significantly 
			when the other variable is in the model, and also...</li>
		<li>At least one of the explanatory variable is needed in the model, but we 
			cannot tell whether <em>X</em> or <em>Z</em> is the more important.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In terms of the tests that were described above, this corresponds to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Both t-tests have large p-values, implying that either of the variables 
			could be dropped from the full model, and</li>
		<li>The F-test has a small p-value, implying that <strong>at least</strong> 
			one of the variables is needed in the model.</li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>This may <strong>seem</strong> like a paradox but can be understood if you 
    think carefully about the hypotheses that the tests are testing.</p>

    <p>The diagram below shows the results of F- and t-tests applied to the heart 
			catheterisation data that were described on the previous page.</p>

    <p>The conclusion from the F-test is that there is strong evidence that at 
			least one of <em>height</em> and <em>weight</em> is related to the catheter 
			length.</p>
		<p>However from the t-tests, we conclude that either <em>height</em> or <em>weight</em> 
			can be dropped from the full model (leaving the other variable). Only one 
			explanatory variable seems to be needed in the model, but there is little 
			evidence about which is the more important of the two.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The surgeon does not need to use both 
							<em>height</em> and <em>weight</em> to predict the required catheter 
							length, but there is little evidence about which of the two variables 
							will give the more accurate predictions.</p>

		<p class="heading">Leafing-out time</p>

    <p>In a study of genetic variation in sugar maple, the time of leafing-out 
			of nursery seedlings in Wooster, Ohio, was measured in units of a weighted 
			mean index in April, 1955. The seeds had been selected from native trees 
			in the Eastern United States and Canada. Their time to leafing-out (Y = 
			mean index) has been related to latitude north (X = °North) and the 
			mean July temperature at the place of origin (Z = °F).</p>
		<p>We wish to examine the relationship between Y and the explanatory variables 
			X and Z since any connection would show that the place of origin had an 
			effect on leafing-out time. Since this effect could only be transmitted 
			genetically via the seeds, it would imply a genetic difference between plants 
			in the different areas. (<strong>Click</strong> on crosses to see the source 
			of each batch of seeds.)</p>

    <p>The F-test gives strong evidence that at least one of the explanatory variables 
			is related to leafing-out time so we can conclude that there is a genetic 
			difference between the seeds.</p>
		<p>In this example, the t-tests give information about which of the explanatory 
			variables is more important. If temperature is in the model, there is moderately 
			strong evidence that latitude is also needed (from the top t-test). However 
			if latitude is in the model, there is no evidence that temperature is also 
			needed (from the second t-test). We can therefore conclude that latitude 
			is the more important variable in explaining leafing-out time.</p>
