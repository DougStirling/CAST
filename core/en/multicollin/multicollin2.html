<p class="heading">Variance inflation factors</p>
	<p>The loss of accuracy of <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> 
		and <em>b</em><sub>2</sub> 
		due to the correlation between <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em> is quantified by 
		their <strong>variance inflation factors (VIF)</strong>, defined by:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/vifDefn.gif" width="398" height="60" alt="eqn"> 
	</p>
	<p>For example, if the VIF for the slope parameter associated with <em>X</em> 
		is 4.0, its variance is 4 times what it would have been if <em>X</em> and 
		<em>Z</em> were uncorrelated &mdash; i.e. its standard deviation is twice the minimum 
		possible.</p>
	<p>Since the formula for the actual variance of <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> 
		is </p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/bxVarEqn.gif" width="196" height="45" alt="eqn"> 
	</p>
	<p>and its minimum value arises when <em>r</em> is zero (uncorrelated explanatory 
		variables), and a similar formula holds for the other slope parameter, the 
		variance inflation factors can both be written as</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/vifSimpleEqn.gif" width="111" height="35" alt="eqn"> 
	</p>
	
	<p class="gray">(Although both VIFs are the same in models with only 
		two explanatory variables, all VIFs are usually different in models with three 
		or more explanatory variables.)</p>

    <p class="heading">Illustration</p>

    <p>The diagram below shows a normal linear model, represented by two planes &plusmn; 2&sigma; 
			above and below the regression plane. (95% of response values from the
model  would be expected to be between these planes.)</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>y</em> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 2.0 + 0.4 <em>x</em></span> 
		</p>
		<p>The x- and z-values are represented by crosses on the x-z plane and red 
			vertical lines above each cross between the &plusmn; 2&sigma;		planes. (Rotate with the mouse or buttons to understand this diagram better.)</p>

    <p>At the bottom of the diagram, the distributions of the least squares slopes 
			are shown &mdash; they are normal distributions. (We will <strong>not</strong> 
			simulate data from the model in this diagram to check that they are correct.)</p>
		<p>Drag the slider to adjust the correlation between <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em>. 
			Observe that the spread of the two distributions is lowest when <em>X</em> 
			and <em>Z</em> are uncorrelated (and hence the VIF is 1.0). When the correlation 
			is increased, the VIF also becomes higher.</p>
    </div>

  <p class="heading">Multicollinearity and orthogonal variables</p>
	<p>When the two explanatory variables <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em> are highly correlated, 
		they are called <strong>multicollinear</strong>. (There is no precise definition 
		for the term.)</p>
	<p>Uncorrelated explanatory variables are called <strong>orthogonal</strong>. 
		When the explanatory variables are orthogonal,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Both <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> 
			and <em>b</em><sub>2</sub> 
			are more accurate (more variable) than if <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em> had 
			similar standard deviations but were correlated.</li>
		<li>The VIFs for both <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> 
			and <em>b</em><sub>2</sub> 
			are 1.0.</li>
		<li>Also, <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> 
			and <em>b</em><sub>2</sub> 
			are uncorrelated.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Orthogonal explanatory variables are clearly desirable, but in practice they 
		usually only arise from designed experiments &mdash; in experiments, the values 
		of <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em> can be <strong>chosen</strong> to be uncorrelated.</p>
