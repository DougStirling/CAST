<p class="heading">Mutually exclusive events</p>
<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>Two events, \(A\) and \(B\) are called <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> if they have no outcomes in common. More precisely, using set notation, this is when</p>
\[
A \cap B = \emptyset
\]
</div>

<p>In other words, \(A\) and \(B\) are called mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.</p>
<p class="heading">Properties of probability</p>
<p>In 1933,  Kolmogorov published a paper basing the 'theory' of probability to a small number of axioms that hold for <strong>all</strong> definitions of probability. Anything derived from these axioms also holds, no matter how probability is defined, so we no longer need to distinguish between the different definitions in the last section.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class='definitionTitle'>Axioms of probability</p>
<ol>
	<li>P(S) = 1       where <em>S</em> is the sample space</li>
	<li>0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1        for any event, E</li>
	<li>P(A <strong>or</strong> B) = P(A) + P(B)         if events A and B are mutually exclusive</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>These axioms are  central to probability. The rest of probability theory can be derived from them.</p>
