<p class="heading">Testing for zero slope</p>

<p>To assess whether the explanatory variable affects the response, we test the 
hypotheses </p>

<p class=eqn><span class="blue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&beta;<sub>1</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0<br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&beta;<sub>1</sub>  &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;  0</span>
</p>

<p>The least squares slope from a sample, <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>, 
is the obvious statistic to throw light on the value of β<sub>1</sub>, 
but <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> varies from sample to sample. We must therefore take account of its standard deviation 
to assess its distance from zero. </p>

<p class="heading">If we knew the error standard deviation (we don't!)</p>
<p>If we knew the value of σ, 
we could evaluate the standard deviation of <em>b</em><sub>1</sub></p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../regnTest/images/sdSlopeEqn.gif" width="129" height="42"> 
</p>
<p>This could be used to standardise <em>b</em><sub>1</sub></p>

<div class="centred">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" class="centred">
<tr>
<th style="margin:0px; padding:0px"><span class="black bold">standardised value,</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>

</div>
<p>and <span class="em black">z</span>  would have a standard normal distribution 
(mean 0 and sd 1) if β<sub>1</sub> is really zero (<strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>). The p-value for the test would 
therefore be the probability of getting a value from the standard normal distribution 
that is as far from zero as the z-value that you evaluated from your data.</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/zForTestingSlope.gif" width="294" height="141"></p>
<p class="heading">Test statistic in practice</p>
  
<p>Unfortunately σ is usually unknown and the standard deviation of <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> must be <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('regnEst4')">estimated 
from the sample data</a>. We therefore use a test statistic of the form </p>

<div class="centred">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" class="centred">
<tr>
<th style="margin:0px; padding:0px"><span class="black bold">t ratio,</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>

<p class="heading">The p-value</p>
  
<p>The only change to the method when using the test statistic <span class="em black">t</span>  
rather than <span class="em black">z</span>  is that a t distribution with 
<i><span class="black">n</span></i><span class="black">&nbsp;-&nbsp;2</span> 
degrees of freedom must be used to obtain the p-value instead of the standard 
normal distribution.</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/slopeTestP.gif" width="426" height="268">
</p>

<p>The p-value is interpreted in the same way as for other hypothesis tests. </p>
<p class="heading">Interpretation of p-value</p>
<p>Consider a data set with least squares slope <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> and corresponding p-value,   0.0023. The p-value tells us that the 
probability of getting a  least squares slope as far from zero 
as <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> would be only 0.0023 if <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> was true (i.e. if <i>Y</i> and <i>X</i> 
were not related). Since this is very unlikely, the data give strong 
evidence that the linear model slope is <strong>not</strong> zero and therefore that the response 
is related to the explanatory variable. </p>
<p>Similarly, if we calculate that the p-value for <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> is 0.4, this tells us that a least squares slope as far from zero as <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> would occur with probability 0.4, even if <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> were not related. Since this is fairly high, our conclusion should be that there is no reason to doubt the null hypothesis &mdash;  there is no evidence of a relationship 
	between the response and explanatory variables. </p>
