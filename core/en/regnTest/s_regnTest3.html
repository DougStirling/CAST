<p class="heading notPrinted">Strength of  relationship vs strength of <span class="darkred">evidence</span> for
relationship</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the correlation coefficient, <em>r</em>,
and the p-value for testing whether there is a relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Correlation coefficient</dt>
<dd>Describes the strength of the relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em></dd>
<dt>The p-value for testing whether <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are related</dt>
<dd>Describes the strength of <strong>evidence</strong> for whether <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are
related <strong>at all</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>It is important not to confuse these two values when interpreting the p-value
for a test.</p>
<ul>
<li>A p-value  close to zero does <strong>not</strong> imply that there must
be a strong relationship. It
just means that we are <strong>sure</strong> that
there is <strong>some</strong> relationship, however weak.</li>
<li>A large p-value  does <strong>not</strong> imply that the relationship
must be weak. The sample size might just be too small to be sure that the relationship
exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is partly explained by an alternative formula for the test statistic,</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/s_tFromR.gif" width="162" height="48"></p>
<p>The test statistic and  the p-value therefore both depend on both <em>r</em> and
the sample size, <em>n</em>. Increasing <em>n</em> and increasing <em>r</em> <strong>both</strong> result
in a lower p-value.</p>
