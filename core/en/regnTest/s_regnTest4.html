<p class="heading notPrinted">Properties of p-value</p>
<p>P-values for testing whether a linear model's slope is zero have the same
properties as p-values for other hypothesis tests. In particular, </p>
<ul>
<li>When <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> is true (i.e. <i>Y</i> is not related to <i>X</i>),
all p-values between 0 and 1 are equally likely.</li>
<li>If <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> is true (i.e. <i>Y</i> and <i>X</i> are
related), then  p-values  near zero
are more likely than p-values near 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>When <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> are not related
(β<sub>1</sub> = 0), it is still possible to get small p-values, suggesting that
β<sub>1</sub> is <strong>not</strong> zero. However there is only probability
0.01 of getting a p-value as low as 0.01 &mdash; it is unlikely but possible. Such
a p-value is more likely if the variables <strong>are</strong> related so we
interpret it as giving strong evidence of a relationship.</p>
