<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
	<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
		from some members of the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>
	<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
		the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
		the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
		only a subgroup of it.</p>
	<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>
	<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Failure to contact the individuals.</li>
		<li>Refusal to participate in the study.</li>
		<li>Refusal to answer particular questions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
		survey are likely to be biased.</p>
