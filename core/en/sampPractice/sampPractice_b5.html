<p class=heading>'Missing' responses</p>
<p>The first two types of non-sampling error are caused by failure to obtain information 
from some members of the target population.</p>
<p class=heading>Coverage error</p>

<p><strong>Coverage error</strong> occurs when the sample is not selected from 
the target population, but from only part of the target population. As a result, 
the estimates that are obtained do not describe the whole target population &mdash; 
only a subgroup of it.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>A researcher is interested in irrigation practice amoung wheat growers in a 
region. There is no database containing names and addresses of all farmers growing 
wheat, so questionnaires are sent to members of a local wheat-growers association. 
Depending on the number and characteristics of farmers who grow wheat but are 
<strong>not</strong> members of the association, there is potential for considerable 
coverage error. </p>

<p>An ecologist studying the wildlife in a reserve collects daily the carcasses 
of possums that were killed on the road that runs through the reserve. Various 
physiological measurements were made from each of the 20 possums that were obtained 
in this manner.</p>
<p> There is potential for considerable coverage error if the possums that venture 
onto the road are not 'typical' of all possums in the reserve. </p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Non-response error</p>

<p>In many surveys, some selected individuals do not respond. This may be caused by ...
</p>

<ul>
  
<li>Failure to contact the individuals. In a telephone survey, there will be no 
answer from some numbers. In a door-to-door survey, there may be no one at home.</li>
  <li>Refusal to participate in the study. Some individuals will be too busy or
  will object to the invasion of their privacy.</li>
  <li>Refusal to answer particular questions. For example, people are often unwilling
  to disclose their incomes or information that is of commercial value to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>If non-response is related to the questions being asked, estimates from the 
survey are likely to be biased.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p>A survey is conducted to assess the number of times that residents in a city 
visited their doctor in the previous year. Phone numbers are randomly selected 
from a telephone directory and these numbers are phoned in weekday evenings. </p>

<p>People who are not at home (and therefore do not respond) are more likely to 
be healthy than those who do respond, so the sample responding will tend to overestimate 
the average number of doctor visits per resident. The estimate would therefore 
be biased. </p>

<p class="gray">There are several other flaws in this survey that
introduce further non-sampling errors. In particular, there is also coverage error
since residents whose numbers are not listed in the telephone directory cannot be
sampled.</p>

<p class=heading>Real example</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p>In the 1936 American presidential election, there were
two candidates, Roosevelt and Landon. The <i>Literary Digest</i> conducted a poll,
aiming to predict the result of the election; its procedure was to mail questionnaires
to 10 million Americans (using names from telephone books and club membership).
From the 2.4 million replies, it made the following prediction:
</p>
<div class="centred">
	<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
		<caption align="TOP">
			<strong>Percentage of votes</strong>
			</caption>
		<tr>
			<th align="CENTER"> </th>
			<th align="CENTER">&nbsp;Landon&nbsp;</th>
			<th align="CENTER">&nbsp;Roosevelt&nbsp;</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Literary Digest's prediction&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td bgcolor=white align="CENTER" style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-left:1px solid #999999;">57</td>
			<td bgcolor=white align="CENTER" style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;">43</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Actual result</td>
			<td bgcolor=white align="CENTER" style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999; border-left:1px solid #999999;">38</td>
			<td bgcolor=white align="CENTER" style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;">62</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>Despite the large sample size (and resulting small sampling error), the
non-sampling errors were extremely large in the poll.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only individuals in households with telephones or in clubs were sampled (coverage error).
  <li>Of these, only 24% replied (non-response error).</li>
</ul>

<p>The group who responded would have different
characteristics from the whole population, hence the large difference between the
Literary Digest prediction and the actual election result.
</p>

<p class="gray">Incidentally, another pollster, George Gallup, also conducted
a survey before this election. Although he only sampled 50,000 people, he put
more effort into making his sample representative. His poll predicted that Roosevelt
would win the election with 56 percent of the vote, much closer to the actual result.
