<p class="heading">Sampling frame</p>

<p>Both simple random samples and stratified random samples require a complete 
list of all individuals in the target population. This list might be obtained 
from an electoral roll or some other publicly available list and is called a <strong>sampling 
frame</strong>.</p>
<p>In other situations, a complete list is unavailable, so a different sampling 
scheme is necessary. For example, a town council might be interested in collecting 
information from  teenage children. Without a complete list of 
such children, how might you sample them?</p>
<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to group the target individuals into reasonably 
small groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>, for which a complete list is available. 
Clusters are similar to the strata that are used for stratified sampling, but 
are usually much smaller. For example, to sample teenage children in a town, the 
clusters might be defined by the different streets. (Long streets might be split 
into shorter sections.) It is not necessary to know beforehand how many children 
live in each street.</p>
<p>For cluster sampling, a <strong>simple random sample of clusters</strong> is 
selected, with all individuals in these clusters selected. For example, in any 
selected street, an interviewer might approach each household in order to identify 
the households with teenage children and obtain information from them.</p>
<p>The mean of any variable that is calculated from the individuals in a cluster 
sample can be used to estimate the corresponding characteristic of the underlying 
population.</p>
<p class="heading">Cost advantages</p>
<p>Even when a complete sampling frame is available, cluster sampling might be 
used to reduce the cost of sampling (or to increase the sample size for the same 
cost) since it is often cheaper to record information from individuals in the 
same cluster than from different parts of the sampling frame.</p>
<p>For example, it is cheaper to interview people in every house in several streets 
than to interview the same number of individuals who are scattered randomly over 
the town.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Illustration of cluster sampling"> 
<p>The diagram below illustrates cluster sampling. The population of 324 individuals 
has been split into 36 clusters, each of which contains 9 individuals. (In many 
practical situations, the cluster sizes would be different.)</p>

<p class="heading">Accuracy of cluster sampling</p>
<p>When individuals in the same cluster tend to be more similar than individuals 
in different clusters, the estimates that are obtained from cluster sampling are 
more variable (and hence less accurate) than the corresponding estimates from 
a simple random sample of the same size.</p>

<p>The ordinary formula for the standard deviation of a sample mean will

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> several times to build up the distribution 
of the mean using cluster sampling of 5 clusters. Choose <strong>Simple random 
sample</strong> from the pop-up menu then take several more samples. Since all 
clusters have similar spreads of values, simple random sampling and cluster sampling 
result in sample means with similar distributions (i.e. similar accuracy). </p>
<p>Move the slider to about half-way to accentuate the differences between the 
clusters (the four values in each cluster become more similar) and observe that 
this has little effect on the accuracy of the sample mean when simple random sampling 
is used. However the sample mean becomes much more variable with cluster sampling.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Cluster sampling is as good as simple random sampling if the clusters 
are similar to each other, but is worse if the clusters are different.</p>
