<p class=heading>'Inaccurate' responses</p>
	<p>The next two types of non-sampling error are caused by inaccurate information 
		being obtained from the sampled individuals.</p>
	<p class=heading>Instrument error</p>
	<p><strong>Instrument error</strong> usually results from poorly designed
		questions. Different wording of questions can lead to different answers being 
		given by a respondent. The wording of the question may be such as to elicit some
		particular response (a <strong>leading</strong> question) or it may simply be carelessly
		worded so that it is misinterpreted by some respondents. </p>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer error</p>
	<p><strong>Interviewer error</strong> occurs when some characteristic of the interviewer, such
		as age or sex, affects the way in which respondents answer questions.</p>
