<p>A simple random sample of individuals from a population is the easiest sampling scheme to understand, but other sampling schemes may give more accurate estimates of population characteristics.</p>
	<p class="heading">Grouping of individuals</p>
	<p>If the individuals in the population can be split into different groups (called <strong>strata</strong> in sampling terminology), it is often better to take a 
		simple random sample <strong>within each separate group</strong> than to sample 
		randomly from the whole population. This is called a <strong>stratified random 
			sample</strong>.</p>
	<p>The  proportion sampled from the different strata are usually fixed to be the same as the proportions of individuals in the strata in the population. In a simple random sample, the proportions sampled from the strata might not match the population proportions, so a stratified random sample should be more 'representative'.</p>
