<p class="heading">Sampling from large populations</p>

<p>Two-stage sampling is a sampling scheme that is related to cluster sampling, 
but is of most use for large populations when the individuals are very widely 
separated in some sense. For example, many polls are conducted to obtain <strong>national</strong> 
information about voting intentions or consumer purchases, and there is a high 
cost associated with travelling between different regions.</p>
<p>In two-stage sampling, the population is separated into groups of adjacent 
individuals called <strong>primary sampling units</strong>. These primary sampling 
units are typically large &mdash; for example a country might be split into 20 or more 
regions. A small number of these are selected according to some sampling scheme, 
then individuals are sub-sampled within each selected primary unit.</p>
<p>Costs are reduced by limiting sampling to a small number of primary units. 
For example, if individuals are only sampled from within say 5 regions, travelling 
and accommodation costs will be considerably reduced.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration of two-stage sampling"> 
<p>The diagram below is a small-scale illustration of two-stage sampling of 16 
values from a population of 128 individuals.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> to select all 16 primary sampling units 
and a sample of size 1 from each. This is identical to a stratified random sample.</p>
<p>Change the control <strong>Primary units sampled</strong> to 2 primary units. 
Click <strong>Take sample</strong> to randomly select two of the primary units, 
with all individuals in each unit being sampled. Since complete primary units 
are sampled, this extreme is identical to cluster sampling.</p>
<p>Finally, change the control to select either 4 or 8 primary units. Taking a 
sample now involves a random selection of primary units, followed by a random 
selection of individuals within each. Typically there are large numbers of individuals 
and primary units so random sampling is needed for both primary units and individuals 
within them.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Cost and accuracy (advanced)</p>
<p>In the example above, there was a considerable cost involved with travel between 
the primary units, so the total cost is reduced when fewer primary units are sampled. 
Unfortunately, the accuracy of the resulting estimate is usually lower in this 
situation.</p>
<p>The number of primary units to sample is therefore a trade-off between accuracy 
and cost. The details are beyond the scope of CAST.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Demonstration of benefits from two-stage sampling">
<p>In the diagram below, the vertical bands separate 16 primary units, each of 
which contains 8 individuals whose values are shown in a jittered dot plot.</p>

<p>Initially, all primary units are similar &mdash; their means are nearly the same. 
Click <strong>Take sample</strong> several times to observe the sampling distribution 
of the mean (in the pink band to the right of the population dot plots). When 
the number of primary units sampled is changed, the distribution of the mean remains 
the same. The most cost-effective sampling scheme is therefore to sample the smallest 
number of primary units possible.</p>
<p>Change the slider at the bottom to half-way between <strong>Similar</strong> 
and <strong>Different</strong>. Now some primary units are fairly consistently 
higher than others. Observe that reducing the number of primary units sampled 
now has a much greater effect on the standard deviation (and hence accuracy) of 
the mean.</p>
</div>

<p>As with cluster and stratified sampling, formulae for the standard deviation 
of the resulting estimates are beyond the scope of an introductory course.</p>
