<p class="heading">Sampling frame</p>
	<p>Before taking a simple random sample or stratified random sample, a complete 
		list of all individuals in the target population must be available. This is called a <strong>sampling 
			frame</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cluster sampling</p>
	<p>If a complete sampling frame is not available, it may be possible to group the target individuals into reasonably 
	small groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>, for which a complete list is available.</p>
	<p>Clusters are similar to the strata that are used for stratified sampling, but 
		are usually much smaller. For example, a cluster might contain all of the houses in a street, or all of the individuals in a household. It is not necessary to know beforehand how many individuals are in each of the clusters.</p>
	<p>For cluster sampling, a <strong>simple random sample of clusters</strong> is 
		selected, with all individuals in these clusters selected.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cost advantages</p>
	<p>Even when a complete sampling frame is available, cluster sampling might be 
		used to reduce the cost of sampling (or to increase the sample size for the same 
		cost) since it is often cheaper to record information from individuals in the 
		same cluster than from different parts of the sampling frame.</p>
	<p class="heading">Accuracy of cluster sampling</p>
	<p>The disadvantage of cluster sampling is that estimates are usually less accurate than the corresponding estimates from 
	a simple random sample of the same size.</p>
	<p>However the cost advantages would permit a larger sample size, so cluster sampling may give the best estimates <strong>for a fixed cost</strong>.</p>
