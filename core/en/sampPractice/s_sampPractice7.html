<p>There are various different ways to collect information from human populations. 
	Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
	<p class=heading>Telephone</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response can be high.</li>
		<li>Coverage error is small.</li>
		<li>The number of questions must be kept very small.</li>
		<li>Inexpensive, so sample sizes can be greater.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Mailed questionnaire</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-response is very high.</li>
		<li>Costs are higher than in a telephone survey.</li>
		<li>Mailed questionnaires can contain more questions than telephone surveys.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Interviewer</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lowest non-response and other sampling errors.</li>
		<li>Interviewers must be well trained to reduce interviewer error.</li>
		<li>Most expensive.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires can be fairly long.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Houses are rarely selected at random. Often streets are randomly selected and every
		5th or 10th house in the street is approached. This is called a <strong>systematic
			sample</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading>Street corner</p>
	<p>Some surveys are conducted by approaching people in busy shopping centres or
		similar public places. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Large coverage errors.</li>
		<li>Least expensive and therefore widely used.</li>
		<li>Questionnaires must be small.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To reduce coverage errors, a <strong>quota sample</strong> is often used. Each 
		interviewer is told to interview fixed numbers of old, young, male, female, etc. 
		respondents to match the 
		corresponding proportion in the target population.</p>
	<p class=heading>Self-selected</p>
	<p>Phone-in or mail-in surveys are often conducted by radio stations and magazines. The
		respondents are usually so unrepresentative that the results are meaningless. These types
		of survey should be avoided. </p>
