<p class="heading">A linear model for proportions?</p>

<p>When we modelled how a numerical explanatory variable affected a <strong> numerical</strong> 
response variable, a linear equation was used, </p>

<p class=eqn><span class="black"><span style="position:relative; top:4px"><img src="../../images/symbol.yHat.png" width="10" height="17" align="baseline"></span>&nbsp; =&nbsp; <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>b</em><sub>1 </sub><em>x</em></span>
</p>

<p>When the response variable is categorical, it is tempting to try a similar linear
equation to explain how the proportion in one response category is affected by the explanatory
variable,
</p>

<div class="centred">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" class="centred">

<th style="margin:0px; padding:0px"><span class="black bold"><strong>predicted proportion</strong>,</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
<td style="margin:0px; padding:0px"><span class="eqn" style="color:#000000"><img class="gif" width="104" height="24"></span></td>

</div>
<p>Unfortunately however, <strong>...</strong></p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>... a linear equation is <strong>not 
appropriate</strong> for a proportion since it may result in predicted proportions 
greater than 1.0 or less than 0.0.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Nonlinear models</p>
  
<p>To model how a proportion depends on a numerical explanatory variable, <i>X</i>, 
an equation should give values between 0 and 1<strong> for all possible values 
of <em>X</em></strong>. This means that the equation must be nonlinear in <em>X</em>.</p>

<p class="heading">Quality control for fuses</p>

<p>Some manufactured products are designed to fail under load as a safety precaution. 
For example, in cars many parts are designed to collapse or break off in accidents. 
It is important that these items fail within a fairly tight range of loads.</p>
<p>A company manufactures fuses that are designed to blow when a current of 10 
amps flows through them. Batches of one hundred fuses were tested at currents 
of 9 amps, 9.5 amps, ..., 11.5 amps and failures were noted. The bar charts below 
show the data that were collected.</p>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> the vertical red line on the axis to obtain the predicted 
proportion of fuses failing at different currents. </p>

<p>The linear model is a reasonably close fit to the data between currents 9.5 
and 10.5 amps<sub></sub>.</p>

<p>However the linear model predicts that <strong>more than 100%</strong> of fuses 
will fail if the load is over 11 amps, and a <strong>negative proportion</strong> 
will fail under 9 amps. <strong>Any</strong> linear model will predict proportions 
outside the range 0-to-1 for extreme enough values of <i>X</i>. </p>

<p>Now select the option <strong>Nonlinear model</strong> from the pop-up menu. 
This curve is better than the previous straight line since it remains between 
0 and 1 for all ages. </p>

<p>Again <strong>drag</strong> the vertical red line on the axis to obtain the 
predicted proportion failing at different currents. Observe that this nonlinear 
model can provide reasonable predictions at all currents. </p>
