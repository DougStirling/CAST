<p class="heading">Model and assumptions</p>

  <p>The analysis of variance table and associated test for differences between 
		the treatments are based on a model that is assumed to hold for the data.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><em>y</em> 
				= (overall mean) + (effect depending on block)<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + (effect depending on 
				treatment) + error</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The error is assumed to have a normal distribution with mean zero and constant 
		standard deviation. The most important requirements of this model are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The difference between the treatments is the same whatever the block.</li>
		<li>The unexplained variation (i.e. the error standard deviation) is the same 
			for all observations.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="heading">Transformations</p>
	<p>When the model assumptions do not hold, a nonlinear transformation of the 
		response before analysis often helps. In particular, if high unexplained variability 
		seems to be associated with high response means, a log or square root transformation 
		often helps.</p>
	<p>This is most easily explained in an example.</p>

		<p class="heading">Nicotine gum and tics</p>

    <p>In the following data set, the assumption of equal unexplained variability 
			seems to be violated.</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/nicotineTics2.gif" name="dataImage" width="569" height="354"></p>
		<p>There seems to be far greater variability in the number of tics for the 
			patients who are worse affected by Tourette's syndrome than for those whose 
			baseline number of tics is low, so the assumptions for the model underlying 
			analysis of variance do not hold well.</p>
		<p class="heading">Analysis of square root of number of tics</p>
		<p>A transformation of the response variable (number of tics in 30 minutes) 
			before analysis helps to equal out the unexplained variation. An analysis 
			of the square root of the number of tics is shown below.</p>
