<p class="heading">Confidence intervals for treatment means</p>

  <p>If an analysis of variance test concludes that there are differences between 
    the <em>g<sub></sub></em> treatments in a randomised block design, we must 
    report estimates of the treatment means to help assess which are most different.</p>
  <p>The simplest way to assess differences is with 95% confidence intervals for 
    each of the treatment means. If there are <em>r</em> observations for each 
    treatment (so the total sample size is <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>rg</em>), 
    the appropriate 95% confidence interval for the treatment mean has a similar 
    form to that for a completely randomised experiment (no blocks),</p>
  <p class=eqn><img src="images/blockMeanCI.gif" width="112" height="30"> </p>
  <p>In both the completely randomised and randomised block designs, <em>s</em> 
    is our best estimate of the unexplained standard deviation, which is the mean 
    residual sum of squares from the relevant anova table,</p>
  <p class=eqn><img src="images/sEqualsMeanRSS.gif" width="92" height="26"> </p>
  <p>In a randomised block design, block effects are removed in addition 
    to treatment effects, so there can be much less unexplained variability and <em>s</em> can be much smaller. The degrees of freedom for the t-value, <em>df</em>, 
    are those associated with the residual sum of squares in the relevant anova 
    table.</p>
  <p>If the block effects are large, <em>s</em> is likely to be much smaller when the data are analysed as 
	a randomised block design rather than a completely randomised design. Therefore:</p>

    <p class="heading">Codeine and acupuncture for dental pain relief</p>

    <p>The diagram below shows the pain relief score for the 32 subjects who were 
      each given one of four treatments (combinations of codeine and acupuncture). 
      They were grouped into blocks of four according to an initial assessment 
      of their pain tolerance and the treatments were randomly allocated to the 
      four subjects in each block. (I.e. a randomised block design was used.)</p>

    <p>Click <strong>Show 95% confidence intervals for means</strong>. Initially 
      the confidence intervals are found ignoring the blocking of the data &mdash; 
      as though the data were from a completely randomised design. Observe that 
      there is considerable overlap between the confidence intervals.</p>
    <p>Select <strong>Correct analysis taking account of blocks</strong> from 
      the pop-up menu. Much of the residual variation is now explained by differences 
      between the blocks of subjects, so the estimated residual standard deviation, 
      <em>s</em>, is decreased, resulting in much narrower confidence intervals.</p>
    
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Although we are still 
						uncertain about the difference between the treatments Acupuncture 
						and Codeine, there is now a clearer picture of the differences between 
						all other pairs of treatments.</p>
