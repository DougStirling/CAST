<p class="heading">Relationship between F and t statistics</p>
<p>It might initially appear that the analysis of variance and t-tests are different 
for the hypotheses</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/hypothesesSimple.gif" width="78" height="45"></p>
<p>Recall that the t-test is based on the test statistic</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tDefn.gif" width="84" height="49"></p>
<p>The F ratio that underlies the analysis of variance test is the square of this,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/fEqualsT2.gif" width="146" height="43"></p>
<p>The p-value for the t-test is the probability of recording a t-value as far 
from zero, and this equals the probability of getting as large an F-ratio as the 
one evaluated from the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The t-test and F-test therefore result in <strong>identical 
p-values</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Why use the analysis of variance table?</p>
<p>Nothing has been gained from testing the mean of a normal sample with an analysis 
of variance table and test, so you may wonder why we have bothered to described 
it here.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The analysis of variance approach can be extended 
to analyse and test more complex models.</p>
</div></div>


<p>We have only described the analysis of variance approach to testing the mean 
of a single sample as a simple illustration of this general methodology &mdash; you 
should use a t-test in practice.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Examples</p>
<p>In the examples below, a hypothesis test about the population mean is performed 
both with a t-test and an F-test. Note in all examples that:</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed percent50">
<p><em>F</em> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <em>t</em><sup>2</sup></p>
</div></div>

<p>The p-values and therefore the conclusions are identical for both tests.</p>
