<p class="heading">Testing the mean</p>
<p>In an earlier chapter, we described a t-test for whether the population mean 
underlying a random sample is equal to some known constant, <em>k</em>:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/hypothesesSimple.gif" width="78" height="45"></p>
<p>These hypotheses were assessed with the test statistic</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tDefn.gif" width="84" height="49"></p>
<p>The t-value was compared to the t distribution with (<em>n</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) 
degrees of freedom.</p>
<p class="heading">A different approach</p>
<p>We now consider another approach to testing these hypotheses, based on the 
sums of squares,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/ssqTable.gif" width="271" height="132"></p>
<dl>
<dt>If the null hypothesis holds (i.e. if µ&nbsp;equals<span class="black">&nbsp;<em>k</em></span>) 
...</dt>
<dd>All three sums of squares have chi-squared distributions with degrees of freedom 
given in the table.</dd>
<dt>If the alternative hypothesis holds (i.e. if µ&nbsp;does 
not equal<span class="black">&nbsp;<em>k</em></span>) ...</dt>
<dd>The sum of squares about the mean does not depend on µ 
or <span class="em black">k</span>  so it still has a chi-squared distribution. 
However the sum of squares due to the mean would be expected to be larger.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The hypotheses can therefore be assessed by asking whether the sum of squares 
due to the mean is 'unusually large'.</p>
<p class="heading">Analysis of variance table</p>
<p>To assess the size of the sum of squares due to the mean, we need a test statistic 
based on it whose distribution is known when <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong> is 
true.</p>
<p>The sum of squares table is extended with a column of <strong>mean sums of 
squares</strong> (the sums of squares divided by their degrees of freedom) and 
an <strong>F-ratio</strong> that is the ratio of the mean sums of squares for 
the mean and about the mean.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/ssqTable2.gif" width="500" height="132"></p>
<p>This table is called an <strong>analysis of variance table.</strong></p>
<p class="heading">Distribution of the F ratio</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis holds, we can use the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('twoVariance4')">results 
at the end of the previous section</a> to state that the F ratio has an F distribution 
with (1,&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) degrees of freedom.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/distnOfF.gif" width="344" height="56"></p>
<br>

<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Simulation</p>
<p>We will build up the distribution of the F ratio for testing whether a population 
mean is zero,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/hypotheses0.gif" width="81" height="45"></p>
<p>The diagram below takes samples from a normal population with mean µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.</p>
<div class="centred">

</div>

<p>Since the null hypothesis holds, the F ratio has the F distribution shown at 
the bottom of the diagram. Click <strong>Take sample</strong> several times and 
note that the sampling distribution of the F ratio matches the theory reasonably 
well.</p>
<p>Change the sample size and repeat the simulation. Note that the F ratio always 
has a very skew distribution but its right tail is longer when the sample size 
is low.</p>
