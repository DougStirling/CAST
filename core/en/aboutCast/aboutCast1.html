<p class="heading">CAST?</p>
  
  
<p>CAST stands for <i>Computer-Assisted Statistics Textbooks</i> and is a collection of electronic textbooks (e-books). Three e-books teach introductory statistical methods  with data and scenarios from different 
application areas. Other e-books teach more advanced topics. </p>

  <p class="heading">Features and approach</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CAST is highly interactive.</strong> <span class="black">Interaction with diagrams on most pages retains attention and enhances learning.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>
  
  <li><strong>Dynamic graphics explain difficult concepts.</strong>
  <span class="black">Animations, simulations and other dynamic displays are extensively used.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>
  
    <li><strong>The approach is data-focused.</strong> <span class="black">Learners are exposed to many data sets.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>
  
    <li><strong>Some advanced topics are included.</strong> <span class="black">With a computer-based approach, readers can learn topics that were once considered 'advanced'.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
