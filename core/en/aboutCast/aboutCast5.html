  <p>Doug's interests have alternated between computer science and statistics 
    for many years. He originally attended St. Andrews University in Scotland 
    to study computer science, but graduated with a BSc (Hons) in statistics in 
    1972. After a year's postgraduate diploma in applied statistics at Edinburgh 
    University, Doug returned to St. Andrews University where he earned an MSc 
    in computer science. </p>

<p>Doug's first job was as a research assistant, and later lecturer, in the Department of
Computer Science and Statistics at Queen Mary College in the
University of London. In
1981, he emigrated to New Zealand and has been on the academic staff at Massey University
since then, teaching a wide range of statistics (and occasionally computer science) courses.
</p>

  <p>Doug has done research on various topics, in particular contingency tables, 
		statistical algorithms and the use of software to teach statistical concepts. 
		He was awarded a PhD in computational statistics in 1986.</p>
  <p>In recent years, Doug's research has focussed on how computers can improve statistical education.</p>

<p class=heading>Earlier teaching software</p>

<p>After seeing his first Macintosh computer in the mid-1980s, Doug recognised the huge
potential of computers with graphical user-interfaces for teaching statistical concepts.
In 1987, he published StatLab, a Macintosh program that used simulations to teach
several statistical concepts.
</p>

<p>StatLab was followed in 1992 by Models'n'Data, another 
general-purpose program for the Macintosh that could be used to help teach a wider range of statistical 
concepts.</p>
<p>A simpler user-interface and embedded expository text 
	make CAST much more self-contained than its predecessors. </p>
