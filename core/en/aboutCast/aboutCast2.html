<p class="heading">Structure of CAST</p>
  <p>Each CAST electronic textbook consists of several <strong>chapters</strong>, 
    each of which contains various <strong>sections</strong>. The sections, in turn, are broken into <strong>pages</strong>.  </p>

<p class=eqn>

</p>

  <p>The material in CAST is structured sequentially, so the pages should usually 
		be studied in order. Clicking the arrow at the end of each page displays the next 
		page.</p>
  <p class="heading">Table of Contents</p>
  <p>The red column 
    on the left of this window shows a list of chapters and the sections in 
    the current chapter. It provides your main way to browse the contents of the e-book.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clicking any chapter name shows a list of the sections within it.</li>
    <li>Clicking a section name displays a list of its pages with brief descriptions.</li>
    <li>Clicking the name of a page displays it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your screen is small, you can reduce the size of the table of contents 
    (and increase the size of the panel that shows the individual pages) by clicking 
    the diagonal arrow on the top left.</p>
	
  <p class="heading">Banner at top</p>
  <p>The banner at the top of this window shows the names of the current Chapter, 
    Section and Page. The arrows on its right let you move to the next or previous 
    page.</p>
  
<div class="boxed">
<p style="text-align:left"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note</span><br>
        <span class="darkblue">The pages in CAST are linearly ordered and the arrows move you forward 
        or back one page in this sequence &mdash; the left arrow does 
        <span class="red">not</span> move you to the last page visited.<br>
        Â <br>
        Use the table of contents for browsing around CAST.</span></p>
