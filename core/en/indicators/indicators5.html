<p class="heading">Are the group means equal?</p>
  <p>The model that allows for different means in <em>g</em> groups is:</p>
  <p class="eqn"><img src="images/factorModel2.gif" width="483" height="27"></p>
  <p>In this model, testing for equal group means is equivalent to testing whether 
    the (<em>g</em>-1) slope parameters are all zero.</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We require a simultaneous test for whether 
            all (<em>g</em>-1) slope parameters are zero, not separate t-tests 
            for the individual parameters.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>To simultaneously test whether all (g-1) of the Î´-parameters 
		are zero, <strong>analysis of variance</strong> is required. This uses the 
		methods that were described earlier to <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('multiRegnAnova4')">test 
		whether all explanatory variables in a GLM have zero coefficients</a>.</p>
	
  
  <p class="heading">Components</p>
  <p>General GLM methodology uses analysis of variance (anova) to simultaneously 
		test whether all explanatory variables in a GLM have zero coefficients. This 
		is based on the following components of variation:</p>
  <p class="eqn"><img src="../multiRegnAnova/images/componentsSimple.gif" width="290" height="47" align="absmiddle"></p>
  <p>Rewriting this with double subscripts (with <em>i</em> denoting the group 
		and <em>j</em> denoting the observation within its group) and using the fact 
		that the fitted value for any observation is its group mean, this is equivalent 
		to:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/componentEqn.gif" width="283" height="51" align="absmiddle"></p>
	<p>These components can be shown graphically as follows.</p>
  <p class="eqn"><img src="images/componentPict.gif" width="528" height="252"></p>
  <p class="heading">Sums of squares</p>
  <p>The general theory of GLMs shows that sums of squares of these components 
		satisfy a similar equation.</p>
  <p class="eqn"><img src="images/componentSsqEqn.gif" width="329" height="53" align="absmiddle"></p>
  <p>All summations in this equation are over all individuals in the data set. 
		Since the explained components are identical for all <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> values in 
		the <em>i</em>'th group, this can be simplified into:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/componentSsqEqn2.gif" width="341" height="50" align="absmiddle"></p>
	<p>Since the regression sum of squares describes variation in the group means, 
		it is often called the <strong>between groups</strong> sum of squares. In 
		a similar way, the residual sum of squares describes the differences between 
		values and their group mean, so it is often called the <strong>within groups</strong> 
		sum of squares.</p>
  <div class="diagram">
		<p class="heading">Illustration</p>
		<p>The diagram below illustrates the three components whose sums of squares 
			are central to anova. The jittered dot plot on the left shows a data set 
			that might describe the yields per acre of four viarieties of wheat that 
			were each planted in 8 fields.</p>

		<p>The three jittered dot plots on the right show the total, explained (between-groups) 
			and residual (within-groups) components. Their sums of squares are the total, 
			explained and residual sums of square. <strong>Click</strong> on each of 
			these jittered dot plots to display the corresponding components as vertical 
			lines on the plot of the raw data. </p>
		<p>The slider alters the data, keeping the total sum of squares constant. 
			Change the slider and observe that:</p>
<ul>
			<li><strong>When the slider is close to the right, most variability in yields 
				results from differences between the varieties, and the between-group 
				sum of squares is relatively large.</strong> <br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li><strong>When the slider is near the left, the mean yields for the varieties 
				are similar, so the sum of squares within groups is relatively large.</strong></li>
</ul>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The relative sizes of the within-group and between-group 
sums of squares therefore hold information about whether the underlying group 
means are equal.</p>
