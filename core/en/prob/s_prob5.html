<p class="heading">Marginal and conditional probs can be found from joint probs
(and vice versa)</p>
<p>We have used three types of probability to describe a model for two categorical
variables &mdash; the <strong>joint</strong> probabilities, the <strong>marginal</strong> probabilities
for the two variables and the <strong>conditional</strong> probabilities for
each variable given the value of the other variable. These sets of probabilities
are closely related. Indeed, the model can be equivalently described by any of
the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The joint probabilities, <span class="black em">p<sub>xy</sub></span></li>
<li>The marginal probabilities for <i><span class="black">X</span></i>, <span class="black em">p<sub>x</sub></span>,
and the conditional probabilities for <i><span class="black">Y</span></i>, <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>y</em> | <em>x</em></sub></span></li>
<li>The marginal probabilities for <i><span class="black">Y</span></i>, <span class="black em">p<sub>y</sub></span>,
and the conditional probabilities for <i><span class="black">X</span></i>, <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>x</em> | <em>y</em></sub></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Each can be found from the others:</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/jointCondit.gif" width="537" height="234"> </p>
<p class="heading">Bayes theorem</p>
<p>In particular, note that it is possible to obtain the conditional probabilities
for <i><span class="black">X</span></i> given <i><span class="black">Y</span></i>, <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>x</em> | <em>y</em></sub></span>,
from the marginal probabilities of <i>X</i>, <span class="black em"> p<sub>x</sub></span>,
and the conditional probabilities for <i><span class="black">Y</span></i> given <i><span class="black">X</span></i>, <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>y</em> | <em>x</em></sub></span>.
This can be expressed in a single formula that is called <strong>Bayes Theorem</strong>,
but it is easier in practice to do the calculations in two steps, obtaining the
joint probabilities, <span class="black em">p<sub>xy</sub></span>, in the first
step. There are several important applications of Bayes Theorem.</p>
<p class="heading">Accuracy of medical diagnostic tests</p>
<p>There are
two types of error in a test for a medical condition: </p>
<ul>
<li>A positive test result for someone who does not have the disease.</li>
<li>A negative test result for someone who has the disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider a diagnostic test with</p>
<p class="eqn black"><em>p</em> <sub>negative | disease</sub>  =  0.05     <em>       p</em><sub>positive | no disease</sub>  =  0.10</p>
<p>From these, we can also write</p>
<p class="eqn black"><em>p</em> <sub>positive
| disease</sub>  =  0.95     <em>      
p</em><sub>negative | no disease</sub>  =  0.90</p>
<p>We will also assume that 10% of people who are given the test have the disease,</p>
<p class="eqn black"><em>p</em> <sub>disease</sub>  =  0.10</p>
<p>From this information, we can find the probabilities of having the disease,
given the result of the diagnostic test,</p>
