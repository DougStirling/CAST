<p class="heading">Probabilities in a sub-population</p>

<dl>
<dt>Complete population</dt>
<dd>The joint probabilities <span class="black em">p<sub>xy</sub></span> and the marginal probabilities <span class="black em">p<sub>x</sub></span> and <span class="black em">p<sub>y</sub></span> all describe proportions in the complete population of <span class="black">(<em>x</em>,&nbsp;<em>y</em>)</span> 
pairs.</dd>
<dt>Sub-population</dt>
<dd>In contrast, it is sometimes meaningful to restrict attention to a <strong>subset</strong> 
of the <span class="black">(<em>x</em>,&nbsp;<em>y</em>)</span> pairs. For example, 
we may be interested only in pairs for which the first variable, <span class="em black">X</span> , 
has some particular value. Probabilities that relate to a sub-population are called 
<strong>conditional</strong> probabilities.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The concept of a conditional probability is similar to that of a <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('bivarCat4')">conditional 
proportion</a> that was described earlier for bivariate categorical data sets.</p>
<p class="heading">Conditional probabilities for <em>Y</em>, given <em>X</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>x</em></p>
<p>Consider again hair colour (<span class="black em">Y</span> ) and eye 
colour (<span class="black em">X</span> ) in a population of teenagers. 
The probability of a teenager being blonde, <strong>conditional on blue eyes</strong>, 
is the proportion of blondes <strong>within the sub-population with blue eyes</strong>. 
The conditional probability is most easily understood as the ratio of the population 
<strong>numbers</strong> with (a)&nbsp;blue eyes and (b)&nbsp;both blonde hair 
and blue eyes.</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/conditProbEx2.gif" width="195" height="36"> 
</p>

<p>However if the population is infinite, it is better to express it in terms 
of <strong>probabilities</strong> as the ratio of a joint and marginal probability 
(an equivalent definition for finite populations).</p>

<p>The general definition of the conditional probabilities for <i><span class="black">Y</span></i> 
given that the value of <i><span class="black">X</span></i> is <span class="em black">x</span>  
is </p>

<p class="heading">Conditional probabilities as a rescaling of joint probabilities</p>
<p>The conditional probabilities for <i><span class="black">Y</span></i>, given 
<span class="em black">X</span> &nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="em black">x</span> , 
can therefore be found by rescaling of that row of the table of joint probabilities 
(dividing by <span class="black em">p<sub>x</sub></span>) 
so that the row sums to 1.0, as shown in the diagram below. </p>

</p>

<p class="heading">Two sets of conditional probabilities</p>
<p>Note that there is an equivalent formula for conditional probabilities for 
<i><span class="black">X</span></i> given the value of <i><span class="black">Y</span></i> 
that corresponds to using the other variable to define the sub-population. When 
we restrict attention to population values for which <span class="em black">Y</span> &nbsp;has 
the value <span class="em black">y</span> , the conditional probabilities 
for <span class="em black">X</span>  are</p>

<p>You should be careful to distinguish between <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>x</em> | <em>y</em></sub></span> 
and <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>y</em> | <em>x</em></sub></span>.</p>

<p>Click the formula for the conditional probabilities of 'Y' (grief state)
given 'X' (the level of support). The bars for each type of work are separately scaled up
to add to 1.0. Observe that
</p>

<ul>
	<li>the probability of being in grief state I is highest for those getting good support</li>
	<li>the probability of being in grief state IV is highest for those getting moderate support</li>
</ul>

<p>Click the formula for joint probabilities, then the formula for conditional
probabilities of 'X' given 'Y'. This time the joint probabilities are separately
scaled for mothers in different grief states.
These conditional probabilities are less useful for understanding this example.
