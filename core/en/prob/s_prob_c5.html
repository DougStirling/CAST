<p class="heading">Marginal and conditional probs can be found from joint probs
(and vice versa)</p>
<p>We have used three types of probability to describe a model for two categorical
variables &mdash; the <strong>joint</strong> probabilities, the <strong>marginal</strong> probabilities
for the two variables and the <strong>conditional</strong> probabilities for
each variable given the value of the other variable. These sets of probabilities
are closely related. Indeed, the model can be equivalently described by any of
the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The joint probabilities, <span class="black em">p<sub>xy</sub></span></li>
<li>The marginal probabilities for <i><span class="black">X</span></i>, <span class="black em">p<sub>x</sub></span>,
and the conditional probabilities for <i><span class="black">Y</span></i>, <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>y</em> | <em>x</em></sub></span></li>
<li>The marginal probabilities for <i><span class="black">Y</span></i>, <span class="black em">p<sub>y</sub></span>,
and the conditional probabilities for <i><span class="black">X</span></i>, <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>x</em> | <em>y</em></sub></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Each can be found from the others:</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/jointCondit.gif" width="537" height="234"> </p>
<p class="heading">Bayes theorem</p>
<p>In particular, note that it is possible to obtain the conditional probabilities
for <i><span class="black">X</span></i> given <i><span class="black">Y</span></i>, <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>x</em> | <em>y</em></sub></span>,
from the marginal probabilities of <i>X</i>, <span class="black em"> p<sub>x</sub></span>,
and the conditional probabilities for <i><span class="black">Y</span></i> given <i><span class="black">X</span></i>, <span class="black"><em>p</em><sub><em>y</em> | <em>x</em></sub></span>.
This can be expressed in a single formula that is called <strong>Bayes Theorem</strong>,
but it is easier in practice to do the calculations in two steps, obtaining the
joint probabilities, <span class="black em">p<sub>xy</sub></span>, in the first
step. There are several important applications of Bayes Theorem.</p>
<p class="heading">Detection of fraudulent tax claims</p>
<p>Tax inspectors investigate some of the tax returns that are submitted by individuals
if they think that some claims for expenses are too high or are unjustified.
There are
two possible types of error when an inspector decides whether or not to investigate
a claim: </p>
<ul>
<li>The tax return of someone who has submitted correct claims is investigated.</li>
<li>The tax return of someone who has submitted a bad claim is not investigated</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider a procedure with</p>
<p class="eqn black"><em>p</em> <sub>investigated |
good claim
</sub>  =  0.1     <em>      
p</em><sub>not investigated
| bad claim</sub>  =  0.2</p>
<p>From these, we can also write</p>
<p class="eqn black"><em>p</em> <sub>not
investigated | good claim</sub>  =  0.9     <em>      
p</em><sub>investigated |
bad claim
</sub>  =
 0.8</p>
<p>We will also assume that 10% of tax returns have bad claims,</p>
<p class="eqn black"><em>p</em> <sub>bad
claim</sub>  =
 0.10</p>
<p>From this information, we can find the probabilities of a claim being bad,
given the decision about whether or not to investigate it,</p>
