<p class="heading">Stacking the bars</p>

<p>Bar charts can be effective for comparing categorical distributions in different 
groups and we have seen that clustering the bars in different ways can make comparisons 
easier. An alternative way to reduce the visual separation of the bars that we 
want to compare is to <strong>stack</strong> them within each group.</p>
<p class="heading">Ordinal categorical variables</p>
<p>Stacked bar charts are particularly effective when the categorical variable 
is <strong>ordinal</strong>. An <strong>ordinal categorical variable</strong> 
has categories that are ordered &mdash; each category is 'between' those on either 
side in some sense. If the categories cannot be meaningfully ordered, the variable 
is called a <strong>nominal categorical variable</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, questionnaires often ask respondents to specify their age by ticking 
'Under&nbsp;20', '20&nbsp;to&nbsp;29', '30&nbsp;to&nbsp;39', etc. The recorded 
age is an ordinal categorical variable since each age category is between these 
on either side. On the other hand, the breed of sheep used by farmer (Romney, 
Merino, Cheviot, ...) is a nominal categorical variable since the categories are 
not ordered.</p>
<p>Stacked bar charts would be particularly useful for comparing age distributions, 
but less so for breeds of sheep.</p>

<p class="heading">Growth of roses</p>

<p>The data below arose from an investigation into the growth characteristics 
of rose cuttings. Thirty cuttings were transplanted with each of four combinations 
of </p>
<ul>
<li>two 'scions' (A and B)</li>
<li>two rootstocks (1 and 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>The four groups are therefore called A1, B1, A2 and B2. The measurement of 
interest from each of these groups is the growth of the roses after a period of time, classified 
as </p>
<ul>
<li>very strong (both stems showing strong shoots)</li>
<li>strong (one stem showing strong shoots)</li>
<li>weak (shoots just initiated)</li>
<li>dead</li>
</ul>

		<p>Since there were equal numbers of roses of all types, the relative sizes 
			of the bar charts are the same if we select <strong>Propn within Rose type</strong> 
			or <strong>Percent within Rose type</strong> from the pop-up menu at the 
			top.</p>
<p>Click the checkbox <strong>Stacked</strong> to change the bar chart into a 
stacked bar chart. Since the responses are ordinal (e.g. <em>Strong</em> is between 
<em>Weak</em> and <em>Very strong</em>), the stacked bar charts are particularly 
effective for comparing the groups. Observe in particular that.</p>

<ul>
<li>The two rose types involving <em>Scion A</em> have the bigest proportions 
with strong or very strong growth.</li>
<li>A very large proportion of roses of type <em>B2</em> died.</li>
</ul>
