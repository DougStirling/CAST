<p class="heading notPrinted">Stacking the bars</p>
	<p>The bars for each group in a  bar chart can be <strong>stacked</strong> to
help make comparisons between the groups. Stacked bar charts are particularly
effective when the categorical variable is <strong>ordinal</strong> (has categories
that can be meaningfully ordered).</p>
<p>The diagram below is a stacked bar chart showing  results from a questionnaire
sent to account holders at a bank.</p>

<p>The age distribution of account holders is clearest from this bar chart. By
stacking the proportions within age groups, this information is lost but it is
easier to see that a bigger <strong>proportion</strong> consider the service
to be excellent in the oldest two age groups and almost 20% in the 18-30 age
group consider the service to be only acceptable or worse.</p>
