<p class="heading notPrinted">Stacking the bars</p>
	<p>The bars for each group in a  bar chart can be <strong>stacked</strong> to
help make comparisons between the groups. Stacked bar charts are particularly
effective when the categorical variable is <strong>ordinal</strong> (has categories
that can be meaningfully ordered).</p>
<p>The diagram below is a stacked bar chart showing the results from a questionnaire
in New Zealand about women's ratings of their own body size. The 246 women all
had similar body-mass index and were a little lighter than average for their
height.</p>

	<p>It is clear from this bar chart that there were
more Europeans in the study than in the other ethnic groups. By stacking the
proportions within groups, this information is lost but it is easier to see that
a bigger <strong>proportion</strong> of Europeans believe they are overweight
than the other groups.</p>
