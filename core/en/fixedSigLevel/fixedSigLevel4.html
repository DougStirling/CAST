<p class="heading">Discrete distributions</p>

<p>For continuous distributions, we can usually determine the critical value for a decision rule that <strong>exactly</strong> corresponds to any required significance level. Unfortunately this is usually impossible when the data come from discrete distributions.</p>
<div class="example">
	
	<p class="exampleHeading">Failure of printed circuit boards</p>

<p>Suppose a manufacturer of a certain printed circuit has found that the probability of a board failing is \(\pi = 0.06\), and an engineer  suggests some changes to the production process that might reduce this probability. Suppose that \(n = 200\) circuits will be produced using the proposed new method and  \(Y\) of these will fail. We will use the sample number failing, \(y\), to test the hypotheses</p>
<ul>
	<li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\pi = 0.06\)   (no improvement)</li>
	<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>: \(\pi \lt 0.06\)   (new method is better)</li>
</ul>

<p>We now consider two possible decision rules.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Decision rule: Reject H<sub>0</sub> if \(y = 7\) or fewer fail</dt>
	<dd>The significance level (probability of a Type I error) can be found from the binomial distribution of the number failing.</dd>
</dl>

\[ \begin{align}
P(\text{Type I error}) \;&amp;=\; P\left(\text {decide }H_A \text{ is true} \mid H_0\right) \\[0.4em]
&amp;=\; P(X \le 7 \mid \pi = 0.06) \\
&amp;=\; \sum_{x=0}^7 {200 \choose x} \; 0.06^x \; 0.94^{200-x} \\
&amp;=\; 0.083
\end{align} \]
<dl>
	<dt>Decision rule: Reject H<sub>0</sub> if \(y = 6\) or fewer fail</dt>
	<dd>With this decision rule, the significance level is</dd>
</dl>

\[ \begin{align}
P(\text{Type I error}) \;&amp;=\; P(X \le 6 \mid \pi = 0.06) \\
&amp;=\; \sum_{x=0}^6 {200 \choose x} \; 0.06^x \; 0.94^{200-x} \\
&amp;=\; 0.041
\end{align} \]
<p>Since there are no intermediate decision rules, it is impossible to conduct a hypothesis test based on these data with a significance level of exactly 0.05.</p>
</div>
<p>If a hypothesis test is required at a specified significance level, such as 0.05, a conservative approach should be taken. The decision rule should be chosen such that its significance level is <strong>under</strong> the required value.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Failure of printed circuit boards</p>
	<p>If a test with significance level  \(\alpha = 0.05\) was required for the  circuit board scenario, we should only decide to reject the null hypothesis (and conclude that the new production method method is better) if 6 or fewer boards fail.</p>
