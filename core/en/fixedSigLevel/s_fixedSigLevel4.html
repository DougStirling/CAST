<p class="heading">Discrete distributions</p>

<p>For continuous distributions, we can usually determine the critical value for a decision rule that <strong>exactly</strong> corresponds to any required significance level. Unfortunately this is usually impossible when the data come from discrete distributions.</p>
<div class="example">
	
	<p class="exampleHeading">Failure of printed circuit boards</p>

<p>Suppose a manufacturer of a certain printed circuit has found that the probability of a board failing is \(\pi = 0.06\), and an engineer  suggests some changes to the production process that might reduce this probability. Suppose that \(n = 200\) circuits will be produced using the proposed new method and  \(Y\) of these will fail. We will use the sample number failing, \(y\), to test the hypotheses</p>
<ul>
	<li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\pi = 0.06\)   (no improvement)</li>
	<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>: \(\pi \lt 0.06\)   (new method is better)</li>
</ul>

<p>We now consider two possible decision rules. Their significance levels can be found by adding  probabilities from the \(\BinomDistn(n=200, \pi=0.06)\) distribution.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Decision rule: Reject H<sub>0</sub> if \(y = 7\) or fewer fail</dt>
</dl>

\[
P(\text{Type I error}) \;=\; 0.083
\]
<dl>
	<dt>Decision rule: Reject H<sub>0</sub> if \(y = 6\) or fewer fail</dt>
</dl>

\[
P(\text{Type I error}) \;=\; 0.041
\]
<p>Since there are no intermediate decision rules, there is no decision rule with a significance level of exactly 0.05.</p>
</div>
<p>If a hypothesis test is required at a specified significance level, such as 0.05, a conservative approach should be taken. The decision rule should be chosen such that its significance level is <strong>under</strong> the required value. For example, we should reject the null hypothesis (and conclude that the new production method method is better) if 6 or fewer boards fail in the example above.</p>
