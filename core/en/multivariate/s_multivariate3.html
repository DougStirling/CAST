<p class="heading">Scatterplots of all pairs of variables</p>
	<p>The problem of displaying relationships becomes even more difficult when there
		are more than three variables. It is possible to gain some insight into their relationships 
		with an array of <strong>scatterplots of all pairs of variables</strong>, called a <strong> scatterplot matrix</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Brushing</p>
	<p>Although a <strong>static</strong>  scatterplot matrix reveals some aspects of 
		the relationships between the variables, more insight into the data is obtained 
		by adding <strong>dynamic</strong> features. </p>
	<p>On a computer display, the scatterplots can be dynamically linked, so that clicking on a cross on one
		scatterplot highlights that individual in <strong>all</strong> scatterplots.
		<strong>Brushing</strong> extends this to allow highlighting of multiple crosses on
	a scatterplot with a 'brush' tool. </p>
