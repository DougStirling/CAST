<p class="heading">Relationships between three or more variables</p>

<p>The relationship between two variables is captured completely by a scatterplot.
However there is no comparable display of three or more variables that clearly expresses their
relationships.
</p>

<p>Various displays have been proposed for multivariate data, each of which extends the
scatterplot in a different way. None of them have the same descriptive power that
a simple scatterplot has for bivariate data but, with experience, they can give some insight
into the relationships between the variables. The pages in this section describe some
such displays.
</p>

  <p class="heading">Use different plotting symbols to represent a third variable</p>
  <p>For data sets that contain <strong>three</strong> numerical variables, the 
		simplest display is based on a scatterplot of two of the variables. The third 
		variable is represented by the use of differing symbols instead of identical 
		'crosses' on the scatterplot. A continuous characteristic of the plotting symbols 
		such as colour, size or angle is often used. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The choice of which of the three variables to represent using 
				the plotting symbol is often arbitrary, but can greatly affect how easily 
				the diagram is interpreted.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>Although this kind of scatterplot is easy to draw, it is usually hard to 
		interpret.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Cheese taste test">
<p class="heading">Cheese taste test</p>

<p>In an attempt to understand differences in the perceived taste of cheddar cheese, several
samples were analysed chemically and were also subjectively rated for taste by a panel
of trained tasters. The effect of two chemicals of importance to taste, hydrogen sulphide and
lactic acid, are examined in the scatterplot below.
</p>

<p>The main axes show the taste rating against hydrogen sulphide, and the size of the circles
represents the lactic acid content of the samples
(the larger circles represent higher lactic acid content).

<p>There is clearly a higher taste rating for cheese samples with higher
hydrogen sulphide content. There is also
evidence of a higher taste rating for samples with more lactic acid.
(Consider the cheese samples with hydrogen sulphide content of between 3 and 5.)
</p>

<p>Select the options <strong>Colour</strong> and <strong>Angle</strong> from
the popup menu to use different characteristics of the plotting symbols to
represent lactic acid.
