<p class="heading">Relationships between three or more variables</p>

<p>The relationship between two variables is captured completely by a scatterplot.
However there is no comparable display of three or more variables that clearly expresses their
relationships.
</p>

<p>Various displays have been proposed for multivariate data, each of which extends the
scatterplot in a different way. None of them have the same descriptive power that
a simple scatterplot has for bivariate data but, with experience, they can give some insight
into the relationships between the variables. The pages in this section describe some
such displays.
</p>

  <p class="heading">Use different plotting symbols to represent a third variable</p>
  <p>For data sets that contain <strong>three</strong> numerical variables, the 
		simplest display is based on a scatterplot of two of the variables. The third 
		variable is represented by the use of differing symbols instead of identical 
		'crosses' on the scatterplot. A continuous characteristic of the plotting symbols 
		such as colour, size or angle is often used. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The choice of which of the three variables to represent using 
				the plotting symbol is often arbitrary, but can greatly affect how easily 
				the diagram is interpreted.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>Although this kind of scatterplot is easy to draw, it is usually hard to 
		interpret.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Properties of rubber specimens">
  <p class="heading">Properties of rubber specimens</p>

    <p>In an industrial experiment, 30 rubber specimens were rubbed by an abrasive 
      material. The measurements from each specimen were ... </p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>tensile strength</strong></dt>
	<dd>force per unit cross-sectional area required to break the specimen</dd>
	
	<dt><strong>hardness</strong></dt>
	<dd>rebound height of a steel indenter dropped onto the specimen</dd>
	
	<dt><strong>abrasion loss</strong></dt>
	    <dd>amount of material abraded from the specimen per unit of energy expended 
        in rubbing it.</dd>
</dl>

    <p>The two axes of the following scatterplot represent the tensile strength 
      and hardness of the specimens. Abrasion loss is shown by the size of the 
      circle in the scatterplot (the larger circles represent greater abrasion 
      loss). </p>

<p>There is clearly less abrasion loss for harder specimens. There is also
evidence that abrasion loss is less for specimens with higher tensile strength.
(Consider the specimens with hardness between 60 and 70.)
</p>

<p>Select the options <strong>Colour</strong> and <strong>Angle</strong> from
the popup menu to use different characteristics of the plotting symbols to
represent abrasion loss.
