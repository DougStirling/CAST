<p class="heading">3-dimensional scatterplots</p>
	<p>The most direct way to extend a standard scatterplot of two variables, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, to include a third variable, <em>Z</em>, is to add a third dimension to become an axis for <em>Z</em>. Each individual would be represented by a cross in a 3-dimensional cube.</p>

	<p>Although a computer screen is only 2-dimensional, it can display a projection of
		such a 3-dimensional scatterplot. Rotating such a display with the mouse gives a good
	feel for the shape of the underlying 3-dimensional scatter of points. This is a <strong>dynamic</strong> display that
	is only effective on a computer &mdash; the information in the display is conveyed by <strong>movement</strong>. On paper, we can only present information in two dimensions.</p>
	<p>Three-dimensional scatterplots are an interesting (and occasionally useful)
		way to display data. They are however <strong>much overrated</strong> as an analysis
		technique and simpler displays are usually
		more effective for extracting information from multivariate data.</p>
