<p class="heading">Slicing a scatterplot using a third variable</p>
	<p><strong>Slicing</strong> is a dynamic technique that only displays a subset of the individuals, based on a restricted range of values for one particular variable. For example, we might display a scatterplot of <em>Y</em> against <em>X</em>, but only for individuals whose values of <em>Z</em> are between 20 and 30. The subset can be dynamically changed with a slider or other control to show whether the relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> is different for individuals with low <em>Z</em> and high <em>Z</em>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Trellis plot</p>
	<p>Slicing is a dynamic method and must therefore be performed on a computer. Although less effective, an alternative is to show a series of static plots for different slices of the data. This is called a <strong>trellis plot</strong>.</p>
