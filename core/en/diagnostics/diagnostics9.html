<p class="heading">Summary</p>

  <dl>
		<dt>Leverage</dt>
		<dd>Describes whether the data point has the <strong>potential</strong> to 
			influence the results, due to its value of <em>x</em>, but does not describe 
			whether there is any actual influence.</dd>
		<dt>Residual</dt>
		<dd>Describes the difference between the response value and what would be 
			expected from a normal linear model. Externally studentised residuals effectively 
			highlight outliers and can be compared with ±2 and ±3 as guidelines 
			for what can be expected.</dd>
		<dt>Influence</dt>
		<dd>A function of both leverage and residual that describes how much <strong>actual</strong> 
			influence the point has on the fitted values and regression coefficients. 
			<em>DFITS</em> and Cook's <em>D</em> do a similar job. </dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The diagram below shows how the residuals and measures of influence are related.</p>

<p class="heading">Reason for using these diagnostic summaries</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Why have we defined residuals, leverage and influence? 
						Are the problems not evident by looking at a scatterplot?</p>
</div></div>


  <p>Yes, high-leverage points, outliers and influential points (high leverage 
		and large residuals) are usually evident in a scatterplot for simple linear 
		regression with a single explanatory variable.</p>
	<p>However for more advanced models in which the response depends on two or 
		more explanatory variables, it will be much harder to just 'look at the data'. 
		For these models, outliers, high-leverage points and influential points must 
		be detected from summary statistics, such as <em>t<sub>i</sub></em>, <em>h<sub>ii</sub></em> 
		and <em>DFITS<sub>i</sub></em>. </p>

		<p>The stacked dot plots on the left show the externally studentised residuals, 
			leverages and <em>DFITS</em>, with shaded bands corresponding to the usual 
			guidelines for 'extreme' values. Click any cross to highlight all three 
			diagnostics for that observation.</p>
		<p>Simply from an examination of these diagnostic summaries, it is possible 
			to obtain information about the adequacy of the model and the influence 
			that a single point may have on the results. (Click <strong>Peek at data</strong> 
			to see a scatterplot of the data that helps to explain the conclusion.)</p>
		<p>Select other data sets from the pop-up menu and check the conclusions.</p>
