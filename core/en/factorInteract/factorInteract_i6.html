<p class="heading">Mean residual sum of squares</p>  
  <p>All normal models can be expressed as:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../linModIntro/images/generalModel.gif" width="218" height="34"> 
	</p>
	<p>where the error term has a normal distribution,</p>
  <p class="eqn"><span class="red">ε<em><sub>i</sub></em> &nbsp; ∼ &nbsp; normal&nbsp;(0, σ)</span></p>
<p>In any model, the mean residual sum of squares is an estimate of the error 
		variance, σ<sup>2</sup>. 
		This is an important summary of the model since it quantifies the amount of 
		variation that is unexplained by the controlled factors &mdash; the 'randomness' 
		of the data.</p>
  <p>The mean residual sum of squares therefore provides a baseline measure of 
		variability against which the explained sums of squares can be compared (with 
		F ratios) to assess their significance.</p>
	<p class="heading">Replicates and residual degrees of freedom</p>
	<p>Since the mean residual sum of squares is the denominator of all F ratios, 
		the more accurate it is as an estimate of σ<sup>2</sup>, 
		the more powerful the test. Since the accuracy of this estimate depends on 
		the residual degrees of freedom, we ideally want a large number of residual 
		degrees of freedom.</p>
  <p>Replicates of the experiment &mdash; two or more response values at each combination 
		of factor levels &mdash; are the best way to get a reasonable number of residual 
		degrees of freedom.</p>
	<p class="heading">Data with a single replicate</p>
	<p>Unfortunately experiments are not always conducted with replication. There are often so many treatment combinations that it would be too expensive 
		to repeat each two or more times.</p>
	<p>The need to have residual degrees of freedom to perform hypothesis tests 
		means that either:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>It must be assumed that there is no interaction (since no test is possible), allowing the main effects to be tested, or</li>
	  <li>The data can simply be graphed and hypothesis testing ignored.</li>
  </ul>

		<p class="heading">Bond strength of thermoplastic composite</p>
    <p>Researchers conducted an experiment that dealt with the laser-assisted manufacture of a thermoplastic composite. Two factors were varied in the experiment: the laser power was set at 40W, 50W or 60W and the tape speed was set at 6.42, 13 and 27&nbsp;m/s. (The tape speeds were roughly evenly spaced on a log scale, but we will treat both factors as categorical here so the spacing does not affect the results.)</p>
    <p>A single replicate was used for each of the 9 treatments and the table below shows the interply bond strength of the composite as measured by a short-beam-shear test.</p>

    <p><strong>Drag</strong> the red arrow to add  terms for the two 
      factors and an interaction. Since there are no replicates, the model with 
      interaction fits the data perfectly, so all residuals are zero. The residual 
      sum of squares and degrees of freedom are therefore zero and we cannot test 
    the significance of the interaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Drag</strong> the red arrow up to remove the interaction from the model.	We	have	no way to assess whether there is an interaction between laser power and tape speed, but if we are willing to assume that they do not interact, the interaction sum of squares and degrees of freedom provide an estimate of unexplained variation and allow us to test the main effects of the factors.</p>
    <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
    	<p>If we assume that there is no interaction, we can conclude that there is strong evidence that the laser power affects bond strength but only moderate evidence of an effect of tape speed.</p>
