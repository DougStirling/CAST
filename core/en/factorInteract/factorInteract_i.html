  <dt><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('factorInteract1')">Model without interaction</a></dt>
    <dd>If  two factors do not interact in their effect on the response, the effects of each can be separately described.</dd>
		
		
    <dt><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('factorInteract2')">Interaction 
      between factors</a></dt>
    <dd>A model in which two factors interact in their effect on the response has  a separately 
      adjustable mean for each combination of factor levels. The model can be written using 'main effect' parameters for the two factors and an interaction term.</dd>
    <dt><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('factorInteract4')">Test 
		  for interaction</a></dt>
		<dd>Comparing 
		  the mean interaction sum of squares against the mean residual sum of squares 
		  gives a test for whether there is interaction.</dd>
		<dt><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('factorInteract5')">Reporting 
			results </a></dt>
    <dd>If it is concluded that there is no interaction, the results can be summarised 
			in separate plots of the mean response against X and Z. If there is interaction, 
			the model means for all treatment combinations must be shown in profile 
			plots. </dd>
		
		<dt><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('factorInteract6')">Experiments 
			with a single replicate</a></dt>
    <dd>If there is only a single replicate for each treatment in a factorial experiment for two categorical factors, 
			the effects of the factors can be tested if it is assumed that there is no interaction, but the existence of interaction cannot be tested.</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="javascript:showNamedPage('factorInteract7')">Transformations 
			and interaction</a></dt>
    <dd>The existence and amount of interaction is affected by nonlinear transformations 
			of the response. Sometimes analysing logarithms of the response values can remove interaction, 
			making the results easier to interpret.</dd>
