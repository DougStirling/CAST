<p class="heading">Mean residual sum of squares</p>  
  <p>All normal models can be expressed as:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../linModIntro/images/generalModel.gif" width="218" height="34"> 
	</p>
	<p>where the error term has a normal distribution,</p>
  <p class="eqn"><span class="red">ε<em><sub>i</sub></em> &nbsp; ∼ &nbsp; normal&nbsp;(0, σ)</span></p>
<p>In any model, the mean residual sum of squares is an estimate of the error 
		variance, σ<sup>2</sup>. 
		This is an important summary of the model since it quantifies the amount of 
		variation that is unexplained by the controlled factors &mdash; the 'randomness' 
		of the data.</p>
  <p>The mean residual sum of squares therefore provides a baseline measure of 
		variability against which the explained sums of squares can be compared (with 
		F ratios) to assess their significance.</p>
	<p class="heading">Replicates and residual degrees of freedom</p>
	<p>Since the mean residual sum of squares is the denominator of all F ratios, 
		the more accurate it is as an estimate of σ<sup>2</sup>, 
		the more powerful the test. Since the accuracy of this estimate depends on 
		the residual degrees of freedom, we ideally want a large number of residual 
		degrees of freedom.</p>
  <p>Replicates of the experiment &mdash; two or more response values at each combination 
		of factor levels &mdash; are the best way to get a reasonable number of residual 
		degrees of freedom.</p>
	<p class="heading">Data with a single replicate</p>
	<p>Unfortunately experiments are not always conducted with replication. There are often so many treatment combinations that it would be too expensive 
		to repeat each two or more times.</p>
	<p>The need to have residual degrees of freedom to perform hypothesis tests 
		means that either:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>It must be assumed that there is no interaction (since no test is possible), allowing the main effects to be tested, or</li>
	  <li>The data can simply be graphed and hypothesis testing ignored.</li>
  </ul>

		<p class="heading">Herbicide, insecticide and cotton growth</p>
    <p>An agronomist conducted an experiment to determine the combined effects 
      of a herbicide and an insecticide on the growth and development of cotton 
      plants (<em>delta pine smoothleaf</em>). The insecticide and herbicide were 
      incorporated into the soil used in the containers to grow the cotton plants. 
      The response variable that was analysed was the mean dry weight of the roots 
      (grams per plant) when 3 weeks old.</p>
    <p>Although 20 cotton plants were used for each combination of five levels 
      of herbicide and five levels of insecticide (both in units of lb/acre), 
      only the mean response for each treatment combination was recorded. When 
      analysing these mean root weights, there only a single replicate for each treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>Drag</strong> the red arrow to add  terms for the two 
      factors and an interaction. Since there are no replicates, the model with 
      interaction fits the data perfectly, so all residuals are zero. The residual 
      sum of squares and degrees of freedom are therefore zero and we cannot test 
    the significance of the interaction.</p>
    <p>Click the <strong>y-x</strong> button to rotate the diagram. Try to describe 
			the interaction in words.</p>
		<hr width="75%">
		<p>Finally drag the red arrow up to remove the interaction from the model. 
			For these data, the no-interaction model does not fit well, but observe 
			that this model does have residual degrees of freedom, so hypothesis tests 
			for the main effects of insecticide and herbicide are technically possible.</p>
