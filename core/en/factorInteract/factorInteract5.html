<p class="heading">Models with interaction</p>  
  <p>If it is concluded that there is interaction between the effects of the factors, we must graphically examine the data to ascertain the nature of 
		this interaction. A 3-dimensional 
		diagram such as that in the previous page can be used but it requires dynamic rotation to  effectively describe the effect of the factors and it cannot be extended for experiments involving more than two factors.</p>
  <p>It is therefore common to plot the mean responses for all combinations 
    of the  factor levels against a horizontal axis for one factor, with lines 
    joining the means for the other factor. This corresponds to a rotation of the 3-dimensional diagram showing the model.</p>
  <p>Although there is duplication of information, it often helps to plot these 
		same means against both explanatory variables separately.</p>
	<p class="heading">Models with no interaction</p>
	<p>If it is concluded that there is no interaction between the two factors and there are the same number of replicates for each combination of factor levels, it suffices to separately graph the mean response for each value 
		of X and separately plot the mean response for each Z.</p>
	<p>These plots do not correspond to a rotation of the full model to Y vs X and 
		Y vs Z, but average the parallel lines in such rotations of the full model.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>It is not helpful to examine these diagrams if 
				interaction is present.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>Interaction means that the effect of X on Y is different for different values 
		of Z, so it is not then meaningful to plot an 'overall' effect of X on Y.</p>

		<p>The data below shows the abrasion loss from coated fabric that was treated 
			with two types of filler at three different percentages.</p>

		<p>The diagrams with blue background on the top right describe the nature 
			of the models that can be fitted to these data.</p>
		<p><strong>Drag</strong> the red arrows down to add the two factors to the 
			model, but no interaction. The diagrams on the top 
			right summarise how changing filler type and filler percent alter mean abrasion 
			loss in this model. Rotate the 3-dimensional diagram on the left to <strong>y-z</strong> 
			and observe that the diagram showing the main effect of filler percent is 
			the average of the two coloured lines on the left.</p>
		<p><strong>Drag</strong> the red arrows to add an interaction to the model. 
			The nature of the interaction is described by the multiple coloured lines 
			in the graphs on the right. There is duplication of information here since 
			the same means are shown in both diagrams, sorted by a different explanatory 
			variable. However it is often worthwhile to examine both.</p>
		<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
			<ul>
				<li>Varying the  percentage of filler F1 makes little difference to abrasion.</li>
				<li>Filler F2 has higher abrasion loss than F1 and the abrasion loss for F2 is particularly high when the percentage of filler increases.</li>
			</ul>
			</div></div>
		<p>Rotate the diagram on the left to <strong>y-x</strong> and <strong>y-z</strong> 
			and observe that the two profile diagrams on the right correspond to these 
			rotations. </p>
