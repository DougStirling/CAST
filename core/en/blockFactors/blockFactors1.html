<p class="heading">Treatments and factors</p>

<p>The earlier sections of this chapter have concentrated on randomised block experiments in which a single factor is varied. However the same design concepts also hold when the treatments are combinations of levels for two or more factors. Whatever the treatment structure,</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>In a randomised block design, the treatments are randomly allocated to the experimental units separately within each block.</p>
</div></div>
<p>By grouping similar experimental units into blocks and using a randomised block design, the main effects of the factors and their interactions can be estimated more accurately.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Illustration of randomisation</p>
<p>The scenario below relates to an experiment about the effects of two factors A (with two levels A1 and A2) and B (with three levels B1, B2 and B3). There are therefore <strong>six possible treatments</strong> corresponding to the combinations of levels for the two factors.</p>

<p>The diagram  initially ignores any blocking of the experimental units and clicking <strong>Allocate treatments</strong> randomly allocates eight of each of the treatments to the 48 experimental units in a completely randomised design.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Randomised block</strong> from the pop-up menu then click <strong>Allocate treatments</strong> again. The randomisation now ensures that each treatment is used in <strong>exactly four</strong> of the experimental units in each block.</p>
<p>Change the number of blocks to four and repeat the randomisation, noting that there are always exactly two experimental units getting each treatment in every block.</p>
