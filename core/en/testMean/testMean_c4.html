<p class="heading">Unknown standard deviation</p>
<p>In the examples on the previous page, the population standard deviation, σ, 
was a known value. Unfortunately this is rarely the case in practice, so the previous 
test cannot be used.</p>

<p class="heading">Returns from Mutual Funds</p>

<p>Investing in the share market can be risky for small investors since the value 
of individual companies can fluctuate greatly, especially over short periods of 
time. These risks can be reduced by buying shares in a mutual fund that spreads 
the investment among a wide portfolio of companies.</p>
<p>Different mutual funds invest in companies of different types and with different 
inherent risks of losing and (hopefully) gaining value. Some funds have been categorised 
as 'high-risk' funds and a sample of 25 of these is shown in the table below. 
The percentage return paid by these funds over a 3-year period (April 1997 to 
March 2000) is also shown. (The stock market did particularly well over this period!)</p>
<p>The corresponding annualised return from Federal Constant Maturity Rate Bonds 
over this period was 5.64%. Did the high-risk funds do any better on average than 
this 'safe' investment? </p>

<p>However we no longer know the population standard deviation, σ. 
	The only information we have about σ 
	comes from our sample.</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">Test statistic and its distribution</p>

<p>When the population standard deviation, σ, 
was a known value, we used a test statistic </p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/zStatDefn.gif" width="92" height="47"></p>

<p>which has a standard normal distribution when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> was true.</p>
<p>When σ 
is unknown, we use a closely related test statistic,</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/tStatDefn.gif" width="90" height="46"></p>

<p>where <i>s</i> is the <strong>sample</strong> standard deviation. This test 
statistic has greater spread than the standard normal distribution, due to the 
extra variability that results from estimating <i>s</i>, especially when the sample 
size <i>n</i> is small.</p>


<div class="diagram">

<p>The diagram below generates random samples from a normal distribution. Click 
<strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to see the variability in the samples.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then take about 50 random samples. Observe 
that the stacked dot plot of the t statistic conforms reasonably with a standard 
normal distribution.</p>
<p>Now use the pop-up menu to reduce the sample size to 5 and take a further 50-100 
samples. You will probably notice that there are more 'extreme' t-values (less 
than -3 or more than +3) than would be expected from a standard normal distribution.</p>
<p>Reduce the sample size to 3 and repeat. It should now be clearer that the distribution 
of the t-statistic has greater spread than a standard normal distribution. Click 
on the crosses for the most extreme t-values and observe that they correspond 
to samples in which the 3 data values happen to be close together, resulting in 
a small sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>.</p>

</div>

<p class="heading">The t distribution</p>
<p>We have seen that the <em>t</em> statistic does not have a standard normal 
distribution, but it does have another standard distribution called a <strong>t 
distribution with (<i>n</i> - 1) degrees of freedom</strong>. In the next page, 
we will use this distribution to obtain the p-value for hypothesis tests.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p>The diagram below shows the shape of the t distribution for various different values
of the degrees of freedom.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="300" height="300">

</div>

<p><strong>Drag</strong> the slider to see how the shape of the t distribution depends
on the degrees of freedom. Note that
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The t distribution's shape becomes close to the standard normal distribution
		(the red curve) as the degrees of freedom increase. <br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>When the degrees of freedom are small, the t distribution has much longer tails than the
		standard normal distribution.<br>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>When the degrees of freedom are around 10, the <strong>centre</strong> of the t distribution looks close to a standard normal distribution. However an important use of the t distribution is in hypothesis tests where the tails of the distribution are particularly important. The <strong>tails</strong> of the distributions are quite different.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>A standard normal distribution can be used as an approximation to a t distribution if the degrees of freedom are large (say 30 or more) but the t distribution must be used for smaller degrees of freedom.</p>
