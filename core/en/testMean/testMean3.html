<p class="heading">Statistical distance and test statistic</p>
<p>The p-value for testing a hypothesis about the mean, µ, when σ is known, is
a tail area from the normal distribution of the sample mean and can be evaluated
in the usual way using a z-score. This
calculation can be expressed in terms of the statistical distance between the
parameter and its estimate,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/zGeneral.gif" width="185" height="37"></p>
<p>In the context of a test about means,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/zForMean.gif" width="164" height="52"></p>
<p>Since <em>z</em> has a standard normal distribution (zero mean and unit standard
deviation) when the null hypothesis holds, it can be used as a test statistic.</p>
<p class="heading">P-value</p>
<p>The p-value for the test can be determined from the tail areas of the standard
normal distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/pValueFromZ.gif" width="471" height="212"></p>
<p>For a two-tailed test, the p-value is the red tail area.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Quality control for cornflake packets">
<p class=heading>Quality control for cornflake packets</p>

<p>The diagram below repeats the simulation that we used earlier to test whether a sample mean weight of 10 cornflake packets of 529&nbsp;gm is consistent with a packing machine that is set to give normally distributed weights with µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520&nbsp;gm and σ = 10&nbsp;gm.</p>
<p>Again click <strong>Accumulate</strong> and hold down the <strong>Simulate</strong> button
until about 100 samples of 10 packets have been selected and weighed. The p-value
is the probability of getting a sample mean further from 520&nbsp;gm than 529&nbsp;gm
&mdash; either below 511&nbsp;gm or above 529&nbsp;gm and the simulation provides
an estimate. However <strong>a simulation is unnecessary</strong> since we can evaluate the p-value
exactly.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Normal distribution</strong> from the pop-up menu on the bottom

<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/cornflakeMeanSd.gif" width="144" height="24"></p>
<p>From its tail area, we can calculate (without a simulation) that the probability
of getting a sample mean as far from 520 as 529 is exactly 0.0044. This is the
exact p-value for the test.</p>
<p class=heading>P-value from statistical distance</p>
<p>Finally, consider the statistical distance of our estimate of µ, 529&nbsp;gm, from the hypothesised value, 520&nbsp;gm.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/cornflakeZ.gif" width="341" height="52"></p>
<p>Select <strong>'Statistical distance' from 520</strong> from the middle pop-up
menu to show how the p-value is found using this z-score.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Since the p-value is so small (0.0044), we conclude that there is strong evidence
that the population mean, µ, is <strong>not</strong> 520.</p>

<p class=heading>Weights of courier packages</p>
<p>A courier company suspected that the weight of recently shipped packages had
dropped. From past records, the mean weight of packages was 18.3 kg and their
standard deviation was 7.1 kg. These figures were based on a very large number
of packages and can be treated as exact.</p>
<p>Thirty packages were sampled from the previous week and their mean weight
was found to be 16.8 kg. The data are displayed in the jittered dot plot below.</p>

<p>If the null hypothesis was true, the sample mean would have the normal distribution
shown in pale blue. Although the sample mean weight is lower than 18.3 kg, it
is not particularly unusual for this distribution, so we conclude that there
is no evidence that the mean weight has reduced.</p>
<p>The right of the diagram shows how the p-value is calculated from a
statistical distance (z-score).</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>Choose <strong>Modified Data</strong> from the pop-up menu. The slider allows
you to investigate how low the sample mean must become in order to give strong
evidence that µ is less than 18.3.</p>
