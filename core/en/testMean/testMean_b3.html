<p class="heading">Statistical distance and test statistic</p>
<p>The p-value for testing a hypothesis about the mean, µ, when σ is known, is
a tail area from the normal distribution of the mean and can be evaluated in
the usual way  using a z-score. This
calculation can be expressed in terms of the statistical distance between the
parameter and its estimate,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/zGeneral.gif" width="185" height="37"></p>
<p>In the context of a test about means, the statistical distance is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/zForMean.gif" width="164" height="52"></p>
<p>Since it has a standard normal distribution (zero mean and unit standard
deviation) when the null hypothesis holds, it can be used as a test statistic.</p>
<p class="heading">P-value</p>
<p>The p-value for the test can be determined from the tail areas of the standard
normal distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/pValueFromZ.gif" width="471" height="212"></p>
<p>For a two-tailed test, the p-value is the red tail area.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Quality control for cornflake packets">
<p class=heading>Quality control for cornflake packets</p>

<p>The diagram below repeats the simulation that we used earlier to test whether a sample mean weight of 10 cornflake packets of 529&nbsp;gm is consistent with a packing machine that is set to give normally distributed weights with µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520&nbsp;gm and σ = 10&nbsp;gm.</p>
<p>Again click <strong>Accumulate</strong> and hold down the <strong>Simulate</strong> button
until about 100 samples of 10 packets have been selected and weighed. The p-value
is the probability of getting a sample mean further from 520&nbsp;gm than 529&nbsp;gm
&mdash; either below 511&nbsp;gm or above 529&nbsp;gm and the simulation provides
an estimate of this probability. However <strong>a simulation is unnecessary</strong> since
we can evaluate the p-value exactly.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Normal distribution</strong> from the pop-up menu on the bottom
right to replace the simulation with the normal distribution of the mean,</p>

<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/cornflakeMeanSd.gif" width="144" height="24"></p>
<p>From its tail area, we can calculate (without a simulation) that the probability
of getting a sample mean as far from 520 as 529 is exactly 0.0044. This is the
exact p-value for the test.</p>
<p class=heading>P-value from statistical distance</p>
<p>Finally, consider the statistical distance of our estimate of µ, 529&nbsp;gm, from the hypothesised value, 520&nbsp;gm.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/cornflakeZ.gif" width="341" height="52"></p>
<p>Select <strong>'Statistical distance' from 520</strong> from the middle pop-up
menu to show how the p-value is found using this z-score.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Since the p-value is so small (0.0044), we conclude that there is strong evidence
that the population mean, µ, is <strong>not</strong> 520.</p>
</div></div>
<p class=heading>Pregnancy duration</p>
<p>The duration of a woman's pregnancy is quite variable. For women who receive
adequate medical attention, records show that the duration is a random variable
with mean µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;266 days and standard deviation σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;16 days.
The distribution is also approximately normal.</p>
<p>It is known that women who receive inadequate prenatal care often have shorter
pregnancies with resultant health problems. The diagram below shows the pregnancy
durations of 70 women from an urban hospital in Nashville, Tennessee where many
of the women are from lower socio-economic groups. Their mean pregnancy duration
was found to be 260.3 days.</p>

<p>If the null hypothesis was true, the sample mean would have the normal distribution
shown in pale blue. The sample mean duration is unusually low for this distribution,
so we conclude that there is strong evidence that the mean duration is lower
than 266 days.</p>
<p>The right of the diagram shows how the p-value is calculated from a statistical
distance (z-score).</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>Choose <strong>Modified Data</strong> from the pop-up menu. The slider allows
you to investigate how low the sample mean must become in order to give evidence
that µ is less than 266 days.</p>
