<p class="heading notPrinted">Choice between paired data or two independent samples</p>
<p>It is sometimes possible to answer questions about the difference
between two means by collecting two alternative types of data.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Two independent samples</dt>
<dd>Measurements are made from two samples of individuals from the groups whose
means are to be compared. A 2-sample t-test can be used to compare the means.</dd>
<dt>One paired sample</dt>
<dd>The 'individuals' can be re-defined as pairs of related values from the two
groups and a single sample of these pairs can be collected. A paired t-test
can be performed on the differences to compare the means.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>If the individuals in the 2 groups can be paired so that the pairs
are relatively similar, a paired design gives more accurate results.</p></div></div>
<p class="heading">Matched pairs in experiments</p>
<p>In experiments to compare two treatments, it may be possible to group the
experimental units into pairs that are similar in some way. These are called <strong>matched
pairs</strong>.
If the two experimental units in each pair are randomly assigned to the two
treatments, the data can be analysed as described in this section.</p>
<p>The difference between the treatments is estimated more accurately than in
a completely randomised experiment.</p>
