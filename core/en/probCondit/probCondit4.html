<p class="heading">Tree diagrams for two attributes</p>

<p>Two categorical variables (or partitions of the sample space) are sometimes represented in a type of diagram called a <strong>tree diagram</strong>. In this diagram, we think of the measurements as being observed <strong>in sequence</strong>. The  main branches of the tree correspond to the possible values for the first of these measurements. At the end of each of these branches, further branches are drawn for each possible value of the second measurement.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Gender and marital status</p>
	<p>An adult can be either male or female. For either gender, there are four options for marital status (a second partition of the sample space):</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/tree_marital2.png" width="266" height="310"></p>
</div>
<p>The main branches are usually labelled with their <strong>marginal</strong> probabilities. The branches to the right are labelled with their <strong>conditional</strong> probabilities, conditional on the branches to the left leading to that fork.</p>
<p class="heading">Evaluating joint probabilities</p>
<p>The main use of tree diagrams is to evaluate <strong>joint</strong> probabilities. To obtain any joint probability, multiply the probabilities down the corresponding branches. This corresponds to applying the general multiplication rule, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B | A).</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Gender and marital status</p>
	<p>The probability of an adult being both male <strong>and</strong> divorced is the product of the probabilities going down these branches:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/tree_marital3.png" width="452" height="310"></p>
	<p class="exampleHeading">Bruising of apples</p>
	<p>The contingency table below describes bruising of 96 apples in a packing plant. 
		The apples were classified by the variety of apple (Granny Smith or Fuji) and 
	whether or not they were bruised.</p>
	<div class="centred">
		<table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>&nbsp;</td>
				<th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
				<th>Bruised</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="left">Granny Smith</th>
				<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-left:1px solid #999999;">40</td>
				<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;">8</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th align="left">Fuji</th>
				<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999; border-left:1px solid #999999;">24</td>
				<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;">24</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	<p>We now consider choosing an apple randomly from the batch of 96 apples; it can be one of two types (Granny Smith or Fuji) and it can be bruised or not bruised (denoted below as B and B'). The tree diagram below describes the probabilities for the apple type and its bruising.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/tree_apples.png" width="504" height="239"></p>
	<p>Note that</p>
	<ul>
		<li>P(GS) = <sup>48</sup>/<sub>96</sub> = 0.5 since half of the apples are  Granny Smiths</li>
		<li>P(B&nbsp;|&nbsp;GS) = <sup>8</sup>/<sub>48</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> since 8 of the 48 Granny Smith apples are bruised</li>
		<li>P(GS and B) = 0.5 × <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> = 0.083</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We do not have to represent the apple type first.&nbsp; If we chose to represent the bruising characteristic first, the tree diagram would be as follows:</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/tree_apples2.png" width="504" height="238"></p>
	<p>The joint probabilities on the right are the same whichever ordering of the variables is used.</p>
</div>


	<p class="heading">Sampling without replacement</p>
<p>In the apple-bruising example, there was little to be gained by using a tree diagram &mdash; the joint probabilities could have been obtained more easily directly from the original contingency table. </p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Tree diagrams are more useful for problems in which there is a natural ordering of the two measurements.</p>
</div></div>
<p>An important example of this is when  two or more items are selected from a finite population without replacement  &mdash; in other words, when the same item cannot be selected more than once.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Sampling two students from a class</p>
	<p>We now consider selection of two students from a class of 2 women and 4 men to give a presentation on their weekend reading on the history of Probability. The fairest way to select two students from the class is by &quot;pulling names out of a hat&quot;. The following tree diagram illustrates this process.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/tree_replacement.png" width="358" height="291"></p>
	<p>Note that the probability of the first student being male is P(M)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>/<sub>6</sub> since four out of the six students are male. However the <strong>conditional</strong> probability of the second student being male <strong>given that the first is male</strong> is reduced to <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> since there are now only five remaining students of whom 3 are male.</p>
	<p>This diagram allows us to determine the probability that one student of each gender is selected.</p>
	<div class="centred">
		<div class="boxed">
			<p>P(one man and one woman) &nbsp; = &nbsp; P(MW) + P(WM)<br>
				&nbsp; = &nbsp; <sup>8</sup>/<sub>30</sub> + <sup>8</sup>/<sub>30</sub> = <sup>8</sup>/<sub>15</sub></p>
