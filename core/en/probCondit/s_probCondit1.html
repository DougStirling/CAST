<p>Sometimes we are interested in situations where we have partial knowledge about the outcome of an experiment. Information from this partial knowledge is expressed via conditional probability.</p>

<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>The <strong>conditional probability</strong> that an event \(A\) occurs, given that \(B\) is known to have occurred is</p>
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac {P(A \textbf { and } B)} {P(B)}
\]
</div>
<p>If the events \(A\) and \(B\) correspond to categories of two categorical variables and the  probabilities for the possible combinations of the variables' values are laid out in a table (i.e. their <strong>joint</strong> probabilities), the conditional probabilities correspond to scaling rows or columns of the table to sum to one.</p>

<p class="heading">Two sets of conditional probabilities</p>
<p>Note that there is an equivalent formula for conditional probability of \(B\)<i> </i>given that \(A\)<i> </i>has occurred.</p>
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac {P(A \textbf { and } B)} {P(A)}
\]

<p>You should be careful to distinguish between  \(P(A \mid B)\) and \(P(B \mid A)\). They have different interpretations and usually also have different values.</p>
<div class="boxed">
	<p>The probability of being pregnant, given that a randomly 
				selected person is female would be fairly small. The probability of being female, 
				given that a person is pregnant is 1.0&nbsp;!!</p>
