<p class="heading">Conditional probabilities for <em>A</em>, given <em>B</em><em></em></p>

<p>Sometimes we are interested in situations where we have partial knowledge about the outcome of an experiment. Information from this partial knowledge is expressed via conditional probability.</p>

<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>The <strong>conditional probability</strong> that an event \(A\) occurs, given that \(B\) is known to have occurred is</p>
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac {P(A \textbf { and } B)} {P(B)}
\]
</div>

<p>Consider the hair colour and eye colour of one person selected at random from a group of \(n\) teenagers. If \(n_{\text{blue}}\) of the \(n\) teenagers have blue eyes and \(n_{\text{blue,blonde}}\) both have blue eyes and are blonde, the conditional probability of the teenager being blonde, given having blue eyes is</p>

\[
P(\text {blonde} \mid \text {blue eyes}) = \frac {P(\text {blue eyes} \textbf { and } \text {blonde})} {P(\text {blue eyes})}
= \frac { \frac {n_{\text {blue, blonde}}} {n}}  { \frac {n_{\text {blue}}} {n}}
= \frac { n_{\text {blue, blonde}}} {n_{\text {blue}}}
\]

<p>In other words, the definition gives the proportion of blue-eyed teenagers who are also blonde.</p>
<p class="heading">Conditional probabilities as a rescaling of joint probabilities</p>
<p>If the probabilities for possible values of hair colour, \(Y\), and eye colour, \(X\), are laid out in a table — their <strong>joint</strong> probabilities — then the conditional probabilities for \(Y\), given \(X = x\), 
	can  be found by rescaling  that row of the table 
	(dividing the whole row by \(p_x\)). This makes the row sum to 1.0, as shown in the diagram below. </p>

<p class="heading">Two sets of conditional probabilities</p>
<p>Note that there is an equivalent formula for conditional probability of \(B\)<i> </i>given that \(A\)<i> </i>has occurred.</p>
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac {P(A \textbf { and } B)} {P(A)}
\]

<p>You should be careful to distinguish between  \(P(A \mid B)\) and \(P(B \mid A)\). They have different interpretations and usually also have different values.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>The probability of being pregnant, given that a randomly 
				selected person is female would be fairly small. The probability of being female, 
				given that a person is pregnant is 1.0&nbsp;!!</p></div>
