<p>Consider two partitions of the sample space, \(\{A_i, i=1,\dots, k\}\) and \(\{B, \overline{B}\}\). The probabilities for all possible events can be described in three different ways:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>The joint probabilities</dt>
	<dd>\(P(A_i \textbf{ and } B)\) and \(P(A_i \textbf{ and } \overline{B})\) for all <em>i</em></dd>
	<dt>The marginal probabilities for \(A\) 
		and the conditional probabilities for \(B\)</dt>
	<dd>\(P(A_i)\),  \(P(B \mid A_i)\)  and \(P(\overline{B} \mid A_i)\)  for all <em>i</em></dd>
	<dt>The marginal probabilities for \(B\) 
		and the conditional probabilities for \(A\)</dt>
	<dd>\(P(B)\), \(P(\overline{B})\), 
		\(P(A_i \mid B)\) and   \(P(A_i \mid \overline{B})\) for all <em>i</em></dd>
</dl>
<p>We have already shown how to find marginal and conditional probabilities from the joint probabilities, and how to find joint probabilities from marginal and conditional ones. The following theorem gives a formula that helps find one set of conditional probabilities from the other.</p>

		<p class="theoremTitle">Bayes Theorem</p>
		<p>If \(\{A_1, ..., A_k\} \) is a partition of the sample space,</p>
\[
	P(A_j \mid B)   =  \frac {P(A_j) \times P(B \mid A_j) } {\sum_{i=1}^{k} {P(A_i) \times P(B \mid A_i) } }
\]

<p>In actual examples, it is usually easiest to work out the probability from first principles:</p>
\[
	P(A_j \mid B)   =  \frac {P(B \textbf{ and } A_j) } {P(B) }
\]
<p>The numerator can be found from the definition of conditional probability</p>
\[
	P(A_j \mid B)   =  \frac {P(B \textbf{ and } A_j) } {P(B) }
\]
<p>and the denominator can be evaluated using the law of total probability.</p>

		<p class="questionTitle">Example</p>
		<p>Medical diagnostic tests for a disease are rarely 100% accurate. There are 
			two types of error: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>A positive test result for someone who does not have the disease.</li>
			<li>A negative test result for someone who has the disease.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Consider
			a diagnostic test with conditional probabilities</p>
		\[
		P(negative \mid disease) = 0.05 \quad\quad\quad 
		P(positive \mid no \text{ } disease) = 0.10
		\]
		
		<p>If 10% of people who are given the test have the disease,</p>
		\[
		P(disease) = 0.10
		\]
		<p>what is the probability that someone with a positive test result actually has the disease?</p>
