<p class="heading">Within-group and overall standard deviation</p>
	<p>In some data sets, the 'individuals' can be split into groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_groups.gif" width="499" height="351"></p>
	<p>When the three groups above (A, B and C) are combined,  all information about
the differences between the groups is lost. The overall variability
is also considerably larger than variability within the groups.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>The standard deviation of the combined data 
				set is often considerably higher than that of the separate groups.</p></div>

	<p>It is therefore better to separately describe the distributions within the 
		groups than to describe the overall distribution with a single mean and standard 
		deviation.</p>
