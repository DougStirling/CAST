<p class="heading">Variance</p>
	<p class=eqn style="color:#000000"><strong>variance &nbsp; = &nbsp; (standard deviation)<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; = &nbsp; </strong><img class="gif" src="images/variance.gif" width="74" height="45"> </p>
	<p>The units of the variance are the <strong>square</strong> of 
		the units of the original values. For example, if the values are weights,
the standard deviation might be 6 kg, but the variance would be 36 <strong>square
kg</strong>. Since its units are easier to interpret, standard deviations are
more easily understood measures of spread, but variances are important in  advanced
statistics. (An important collection of methods for analysing relationships between
variables is called <strong>analysis of variance</strong>.)</p>
<p class="heading">Degrees of freedom (optional)</p>
	<p>The divisor (<em>n</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) in the formula for the sample standard 
		deviation is called its <strong>degrees of freedom</strong>. This is the number of 'independent pieces of information' that contribute to 
		it.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Sample of size <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</dt>
		<dd>With only a single value, there is no information about the spread of 
			values, so there are 0 degrees of freedom.</dd>
		<dt>Sample of size <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</dt>
		<dd>With two values, <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, there
 is only a single piece of information about the spread &mdash; the difference 
			between the values, <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> &minus; <em>x</em><sub>2</sub> &mdash; 
			and there is one degree of freedom. </dd>
	<dt>Sample of size <em>n</em></dt>
		<dd>In general, there is one less 'piece of information about the spread' 
			in the sample than the number of data points because the sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, 
			is one piece of information that does not give any information about the 
			spread of the data. There are therefore  (<em>n</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) 
			degrees of freedom.</dd>
