<p class="heading">Hypothesis test</p>
<p>The coefficient of determination, R<sup>2</sup>, summarises the proportion 
of variation in the data that can be explained by differences between the groups. It 
does not however indicate whether this is bigger than could be expected by chance. 
Formally, we want to test whether the group means are the same:</p>
<p style="margin-left:200px; color:#000000"><span class="arial"><strong><span class="bigger">H</span><sub>0</sub></strong></span> : &nbsp; µ<sub><em>i</em></sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; µ<sub><em>j</em></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>for all i and j</em><br>
		<span class="arial"><strong><span class="bigger">H</span><sub>A</sub></strong></span>: &nbsp; µ<sub><em>i</em></sub> &nbsp;≠&nbsp; µ<sub><em>j</em></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>for at least some i, j</em></p>
<p>This hypothesis test also depends on the sums of squares but uses them in a 
different way.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The hypothesis test cannot be fully explained here. 
You should use computer software to evaluate the p-value for the test, but we 
will briefly describe some of the steps.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Mean sums of squares</p>

<p>The first step in evaluating the p-value for the test is to divide each of 
the three sums of squares by a value called its <strong>degrees of freedom</strong> 
to obtain a <strong>mean sum of squares</strong>.</p>
<div class="centred"><table width="90%" border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
<tr> 
<td><img class="gif" src="images/totalMss.gif" width="139" height="43"></td>
<td class="green">The <strong>mean total sum of squares</strong> is the 
sample variance of the response (ignoring groups).</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td><img class="gif" src="images/residMss.gif" width="143" height="43"></td>
<td class="blue">The <strong>mean within-group sum of squares</strong> 
is the pooled estimate of the variance within groups.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td><img class="gif" src="images/regnMss.gif" width="162" height="43"></td>
<td class="red">The <strong>mean between-group sum of squares</strong> 
is harder to directly interpret.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>We explained earlier that the total sum of squares equals the sum of the within-group and between-group sums of squares. Note that the same relationship also holds for the degrees of freedom (the denominators of the above definitions) &mdash; the total degrees of freedom are  the sum of the within-group and between-group degrees of freedom.</p>
<p class="heading">F ratio and p-value</p>
<p>The test statistic is the ratio of the between- and within-group mean sums 
of square. It is called an <strong>F-ratio</strong>.</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/fRatio.gif" width="114" height="37"> </p>
<p>This test statistic compares between- and within-group variation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The further apart the group means, the bigger the between-group mean sum of 
squares and hence the higher the F-ratio.</li>
<li>The lower the variation within each group, the smaller the within-group mean 
sum of squares and hence the higher the F-ratio.</li>
</ul>

<br>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Large values of F suggest that H<sub>0</sub> does not hold &mdash; 
that the group means are not the same.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The p-value for the test gives the probability of such a high F ratio if <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong> 
is true (all group means are the same). It is based on a standard distribution 
called an <strong>F distribution</strong> and is interpreted in the same way as 
other p-values. </p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The closer the p-value to zero, the stronger the evidence 
that H<sub>0</sub> does not hold.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Analysis of variance table</p>
<p>The calculations are usually presented in a table called an <strong>analysis 
of variance table</strong>. (This is often abbreviated to an <strong>anova table</strong>.)</p>

<p>The slider adjusts the relative size of the between-group and within-group 
sums of squares. Observe how this affects the p-value for the test.</p>
<ul><li>The greater the proportion of explained variation, the larger the F-ratio and 
the closer the p-value becomes to zero.</li></ul>
<p>Use the pop-up menu to increase the sample size and observe that a smaller 
amount of explained variation is needed to obtain a small p-value (and hence strong 
evidence that the underlying group means are different).</p>
