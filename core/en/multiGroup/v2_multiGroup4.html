<p class="heading">Comparing several groups</p>
<p>When data are sampled from more than two groups, we usually want to test a null hypothesis that all group means are equal. The alternative hypothesis is that at least two of the groups have different means.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'multiGroup', 'hypotheses', '508', '418');</script>

<p class="heading">Variation between and within groups</p>
<p>If the model means are all equal, it would be expected that the sample means 
would be similar. However they are unlikely to be identical. We therefore need 
to assess whether the <strong>variation between the group means</strong> is unusually 
great. To do this, we must also take account of the <strong>variation within the 
groups</strong>. </p>

<p class="heading">Signal and noise</p>
<p>Variation between and within groups correspond to the ideas of signal and noise in the data.</p>
