<p class="heading">Summarising variation between and within groups</p>
<p>It was explained on the previous page that the evidence for a difference between 
the underlying group means is strongest when the variation between group means 
is high <strong>relative to the variation within groups</strong>. In this page, 
we describe quantities that summarise these two types of variation.</p>
<p>A little mathematical notation allows us to concisely define these summaries of variation. In each of the <em>g</em> groups, there are several values and we use the notation <span class="em black">y<sub>i</sub><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="em black">y<sub>i</sub><sub>2</sub></span>, ... to denote  the values in the <em>i</em>'th group. In general, the <i>j</i>'th of the response measurements in the <i>i</i>'th group is called <span class="em black">y<sub>ij</sub></span> .</p>
<p>The  mean of the values in the <i>i</i>'th group is denoted by <span style="position:relative; top:4px"><img src="../../images/symbol.yiBar.png" width="12" height="14" align="baseline"></span>.</p>
<p class="heading">Total variation</p>

<p>Before summarising variation within and between groups, we first present a 
value that describes the overall variability in the response measurement, ignoring 
the existence of groups.</p>
<div class="centred"><table width="90%" border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
<tr> 
<td width="95"><img class="gif" src="../multiGroup/images/totalSsq.gif" width="79" height="27"></td>
<td class="green" style="text-align:left;">The <strong>total sum of squares</strong> reflects the 
total variability of the response.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Note that the overall variance of all values (ignoring the existence of the groups) is the total sum of squares divided by (<em>n</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1).</p>
  <p class="heading">Variation between groups (signal)</p>
<p>A measure of variation between groups should summarise the distance between 
group means. It is defined in terms of distances between the group means and the 
overall mean, <span style="position:relative; top:4px"><img src="../../images/symbol.yBar.png" width="10" height="14" align="baseline"></span>.</p>

<div class="centred"><table width="90%" border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
<tr> 
<td width="95"><img class="gif" src="../multiGroup/images/regnSsq.gif" width="75" height="26"></td>
<td class="red" style="text-align:left;">The <strong> sum of squares between groups</strong> measures 
the variability of the group means.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>
  <p>Note that the summation here is <span class="black bold">over all observations 
		in the data set</span> &mdash; all values in any group separately contribute 
		the same amount to the between-group sum of squares.</p>
  <p class="heading">Variation within groups (noise)</p>
<p>The measure of variation within groups summarises the differences between the 
values and their group means.</p>
<div class="centred"><table width="90%" border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
<tr> 
<td width="95"><img class="gif" src="../multiGroup/images/residSsq.gif" width="83" height="27"></td>
<td class="blue" style="text-align:left;">The <strong> sum of squares within groups</strong> quantifies 
the spread of values within each group.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>This is also called the <strong>residual</strong> sum of squares since it describes 
variability that is unexplained by differences between the groups. Note that the 
pooled estimate of the common variance, Ïƒ<sup>2</sup>, 
is the sum of squares within groups divided by (<em>n</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>g</em>).</p>
<p class="heading">Relationship between sums of squares</p>
<p>The following relationship requires some algebra to prove but is important.</p>

<p>The three jittered dot plots on the right show the values whose squares are 
summed to give the total, between-group and within-group sums of squares. Click 
on any of these three plots to display the quantities on the diagram on the left. 
The sums of squares summarise the size of the three components.</p>
<p>Use the slider to adjust the data values and observe how the relative size 
of the variation between groups and within groups is reflected in the size of 
these sums of squares.</p>
