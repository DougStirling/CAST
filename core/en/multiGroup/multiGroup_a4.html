<p class="heading">Has <span class="red">any</span> variation been explained 
		by the groups?</p>
	<p>We have distinguished between two concepts (without formally defining them).</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Unexplained variation</dt>
		<dd>The within-group variability is unexplained.</dd>
		<dt>Explained variation</dt>
		<dd>Explained variation depends on the variability of the group means.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>In practice, the group means are unlikely to be exactly equal, so there will 
		always be some variation between the group means even if there is the groups 
		are basically identical.</p>
	<p>The amount of between-group variation is an important indicator of whether 
		the groups really differ, but the within-group variation must also be taken 
		into account to interpret it correctly, as shown by the diagrams below.</p>

    <p>Use the slider to alter the difference between the group means. As the 
      differences between groups <strong>increase</strong>,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the proportion of overall variation explained by the groups increases, 
        and</li>

        different.</li>
    </ul>

<p class="heading">Variation within groups</p>

<p>The diagram below is similar, but the slider adjusts the spread of values within 
each group, leaving the group mean unaltered.</p>

    <p>As the within-group variation <strong>decreases</strong>,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the proportion of overall variation explained by the groups increases, 
        and</li>
      <li>the more certain we become that the groups are <strong>really</strong> 
        different.</li>
    </ul>

		<p class="heading">Are the groups identical?</p>

		<p>The evidence for a difference between the groups depends on both the variation 
			between <strong>and</strong> within groups. It is strongest when:</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<ul>
<li>the between-group variation is relatively high, and</li>
<li>the within-group variation is relatively low.</li>
</ul>

  <p class="heading">Signal and noise</p>
  <p>In the field of communications, the <strong>signal</strong> in a recorded 
		or transmitted message (e.g. music) is defined to be the information about 
		which we are interested. Other variability in the received message about which 
		there is no interest but which can potentially obscure or corrupt the signal 
		is called <strong>noise</strong>.</p>
	<p>Applying this terminology to the comparison of several groups,</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Signal</dt>
		<dd>The variation between group means is the signal in the data.</dd>
		<dt>Noise</dt>
		<dd>Variation within groups is noise.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The greater the noise, the harder it is to detect or estimate the signal. 
		We will next present numerical summaries of the signal and noise in multi-group 
		data. </p>
