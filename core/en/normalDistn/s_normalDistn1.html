<p class="heading">Normal distribution parameters</p>
	<p>The <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('probDensity5')">family of 
		normal distributions</a> consists of symmetric bell-shaped distributions that 
		are defined by two parameters, µ 
		and σ, the distribution's mean and standard deviation.</p>

	<p>The sample data rarely gives enough information for us to be <strong>sure</strong> that the underlying population is  normal, but a normal model is often used unless there is <strong>obvious</strong> non-normality in the data.</p>
<p>Even if the sample data are obviously skew, a normal distribution may be a reasonable
model for a nonlinear transformation of the values (e.g. a log transformation).</p>
<p class="heading">Distribution of summary statistics</p>
	<p>A more important reason for the importance of the normal distribution in statistics 
		is that...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Many summary statistics have normal distributions (at least approximately).</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The Central Limit Theorem shows that the mean of a random sample has a distribution that is close to normal when the sample size is moderate or large, <strong>irrespective 
	of the shape of the distribution of the individual values</strong>. The following are also 
	approximately normal when the sample size is moderate or large...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A sample proportion</li>
		<li>The slope and intercept of a least squares line</li>
		<li>The difference between the means of two samples</li>
	<li>The difference between two proportions</li></ul>
