<p class="heading">Do the data come from a normal distribution?</p>
<p>A histogram of the data can be examined and may indicate that there is skewness or that the distribution separates into clusters. However if the data set is large, a <strong>normal
probability plot</strong> can indicate more subtle departures from a normal distribution.</p>

<p class="heading">How much curvature is needed to suggest non-normality?</p>
<p>In the examples above, linearity or nonlinearity in the probability plot was 
clear. In practice however, the randomness of real data means that the probability 
plot will not be exactly straight even when the data are sampled from a normal 
population. </p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How much curvature is needed to conclude that the underlying distribution 
is not normal?</p>
</div></div>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer and we will not address it here.</p>
