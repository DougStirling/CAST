<p class="heading">Use of z-scores to find a normal probability</p>

<p>Although many programs (e.g. spreadsheets) can find normal probabilities directly 
for any normal distribution, it is instructive to find normal probabilities by 
first translating the problem into one involving a standard normal distribution 
(µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, 
σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;1). 
To do this, the end-points of the required interval are first transformed into 
z-scores.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>Use the template at the top of the diagram to find z-scores corresponding to 
translate the question into one involving z-scores, then drag the vertical red 
lines to find the required area under the standard normal curve. </p>
<p>For a more accurate answer, type the end-points of the interval into the text-edit boxes
above the diagram.

<p>Repeat with at least five different questions until you have mastered the method.

<p class="heading">Normal tables</p>

<p>The use of z-scores are essential if there is no computer to evaluate normal 
probabilities. Printed tables for the standard normal distribution can be used 
to look up the area to the <strong>left</strong> of any z-score.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The next exercise is similar to the one above, but a standard normal table 
should be used to find areas under the normal curve.</p>
<p>Since the table only gives the area to the <strong>left</strong> of any z-score, 
you may need to subtract such areas to answer the question. A template is provided 
for this purpose. (Note however that the lower template is not always needed.)</p>

<p>Again, repeat until you have mastered the method. </p>
