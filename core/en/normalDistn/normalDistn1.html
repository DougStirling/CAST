<p class="heading">Normal distribution parameters</p>

<p>The <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('probDensity5')">family of 
normal distributions</a> consists of symmetric bell-shaped distributions that 
are defined by two parameters, µ 
and σ. 
The mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution are equal to µ 
and σ, 
respectively.</p>
<p class="heading">Normal distributions as models for data</p>
<p>A normal distribution is sometimes used as a population to model the variability 
in a data set. (The data are assumed to be a random sample from this population.) 
On the basis of a single set of data, there is rarely enough information about 
the shape of the underlying distribution to be <strong>sure</strong> that a normal 
distribution is the 'correct' population, but it is often a close enough approximation.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Grass intake by cows"> 
<p class="heading">Grass intake by cows</p>

<p>In an experiment that investigated the grazing behaviour of dairy cows, four 
cows were studied while they grazed on 48 different plots of grass. The grass 
intake was estimated in each plot by sampling before and after the experiment, 
and the number of bites made by each cow was recorded. The diagram below shows 
the grass intake per bite in each of the plots.</p>

<p>There are only 48 observations, so it is impossible to be sure of the shape 
of the underlying population distribution. However the histogram does seem reasonably 
symmetrical, so a normal distribution is a reasonable model.</p>
<p>Adjust the normal parameters with the sliders to match the shapes of the histogram 
and normal curve as closely as possible. </p>

</div>
  <p>Many data sets cannot be modelled by a normal distribution. A normal distribution 
		would <strong>not</strong> be an appropriate model for ... </p>

<ul>
  <li>data that are discrete (counts)</li>
  <li>data that have a skew distribution (with long tail to the left or right)</li>
  <li>data that have very long tails (with most values close to the centre, but a small
  proportion of values very far from the mean).</li>
  <li>data that contain two or more clusters of values.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Data with skew distributions can often be <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('transform5')">transformed 
    into a fairly symmetrical form</a>. A normal distribution may be a reasonable 
    model for the <strong>transformed</strong> data. </p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Do not assume that all data sets that you meet can be modelled adequately 
by normal distributions.</p>

<p class="heading">Normal distributions describe many summary statistics</p>
<p>A more important reason for the importance of the normal distribution in statistics 
is that...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Many summary statistics have normal distributions (at least approximately).</p>
</div></div>

<p>We demonstrated earlier that
<a href="javascript:showNamedPage('randomMean5')">the mean of a random sample has a distribution 
that is close to normal</a> when the sample size is moderate or large, <strong>irrespective 
of the shape of the distribution of the individual values</strong>.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the distributions of the following summary statistics are 
approximately normal when sample size is moderate or large...</p>
<ul>
<li>A sample proportion</li>
<li>The slope and intercept of a least squares line</li>
<li>The difference between the means of two samples</li>
<li>The difference between two proportions</li>
</ul>
<p>Since most statistical methods require an understanding of the variability 
of such summary statistics, it is important that you become familiar with the 
properties of normal distributions.</p>
