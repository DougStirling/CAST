<p class="heading">Inverse problem</p>

<p>In the earlier exercises, you were given a range of x-values and were asked 
for the probability of getting a value in this range. The inverse problem gives 
you a normal probability and asks for the corresponding values of X.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>In the exercises below, decide whether the question specifies the area to the 
right or left of <em>x</em>. Then drag the vertical red line to find <em>x</em> 
giving approximately the correct area.</p>
<p>A more accurate answer can be found with 'trial and error' by typing adjacent 
values in the text-edit box above the normal curve.</p>

<div class="centred">
<script type="text/javascript">outputExercise("exerciseNormalProg.NormalInverseApplet", null, null, document);</script>
</div>

<p>Repeat with different questions until you have mastered the method.
</p>

</div>
  
<p class="heading">Using normal tables</p>

<p>This type of question can also be answered using normal tables. Firstly find 
the range of z-scores that gives the required probability, then transform this 
interval into the actual measurements with:</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed percent50">
<p class="eqn"><span class="black"><em>x</em> &nbsp;=&nbsp; &mu; &nbsp;+&nbsp; <em>z</em> &sigma;</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>The next exercise is similar to the one above, but a standard normal table 
should be used to find areas under the normal curve.</p>
<p>Since the table only gives the area to the <strong>left</strong> of any z-score, 
you may need to subtract such areas to answer the question. A template is provided 
for this purpose.</p>

<div class="centred">
<script type="text/javascript">outputExercise("exerciseNormalProg.NormalInverseTableApplet", null, null, document);</script>
</div>

<p>Again, repeat until you have mastered the method. </p>
