<p class="heading">Independence for random variables</p>

<p>We earlier defined independence of two events, A and B, to be when</p>
\[P(A \textbf{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]
<p>We now use this definition to define independence of two  random variables, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>.</p>
<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
	<p>Two  random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\), are <strong>independent</strong> if all events about the value of \(X\) are independent of all events about the value of \(Y\).</p>
</div>
<p>This definition of independence can be simplified considerably for discrete random variables. It is stated here without proof.</p>
<div class="theoremProof">
	<div class="theorem">
		<p class="theoremTitle">Independence of discrete random  variables</p>
		<p>Two discrete random variables, \(X\), and \(Y\), are independent if and only if</p>
\[
P(X = x \textbf{ and } Y = y) \; = \; P(X=x) \times P(Y=y) \qquad \text{ for all } x \text{ and } y
\]	</div>
</div>
<p class="heading">Proving independence</p>
<p>In many scenarios, we can argue that variables <strong> should</strong> be independent because of the way that the experiment was conducted. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>If two dice are rolled, the number that is observed on the first cannot influence the number that appears on the second. Defining <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> to be the numbers on the two dice, it is reasonable to assume that they are independent.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other situations, independence must be checked using the definition before we can be sure that two variables are independent.</p>
<div class="questionSoln">
	<div class="question">
		<p class="questionTitle">Example</p>
		<p>A couple want at least two children,  but will stop when they either have four children or get a boy, and the probability of each child being a girl is \(\frac {1} {2} \), independently of the genders of previous children.</p>
		<p>Are the family size, <em>X</em>, and the number of girls, <em>Y</em>, independent?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="solution">
		<p>The tree diagram below shows the possible sequences of births and their probabilities.</p>
		<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="../probCondit/images/tree_girls.png" width="393" height="245"></p>
		<p>From it, we can see that the probability of no girls is</p>
\[
P(Y = 0) = 0.25
\]
		<p>and the probability that the family size is three is</p>
\[
P(X = 3) = 0.125
\]
		<p>However the probability that the family size is three <strong>and</strong> there are no girls is zero since that combination is impossible. Since</p>

\[
P(X = 3 \textbf{ and } Y = 0) \; \ne \; P(X=3) \times P(Y=0)
\]
		<p>the two variables are not independent.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p>To prove independence, it is necessary to show that <strong>all</strong> combinations of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> satisfy the relationship, but it is only necessary to find a <strong>single</strong> combination that does not work to prove that <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are <strong>not</strong> independent.</p>
<p class="heading">Notation</p>
<p>When dealing with two or more random variables, we often use subscripts to distinguish between their probability functions,</p>

\[
p_X(x) = P(X = x) \qquad \text{ and } \qquad p_Y(y) = P(Y = y)
\]

<p>Two subscripts are used when referring to the <strong>joint</strong> probabilities for the two variables,</p>

\[
p_{X,Y}(x, y) = P(X = x \textbf{ and } Y = y)
\]


<div class="boxed">
<p style="text-align:left; font-weight:normal">Discrete random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are therefore independent when</p>
\[
p_{X,Y}(x, y) = p_X(x) \times p_Y(y) \qquad \text{ for all } x \text{ and } y
\]
