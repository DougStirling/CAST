<p>Two <strong>events</strong>, A and B, are independent when</p>
\[P(A \textbf{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]
<p>We extend this to define independence of two  <strong>random variables</strong>, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>.</p>
<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
	<p>Two  random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\), are <strong>independent</strong> if all events about the value of \(X\) are independent of all events about the value of \(Y\).</p>
</div>
<p>This  can be simplified considerably for discrete random variables.</p>

		<p class="theoremTitle">Independence of discrete random  variables</p>
		<p>Two discrete random variables, \(X\), and \(Y\), are independent if and only if</p>
\[
P(X = x \textbf{ and } Y = y) \; = \; P(X=x) \times P(Y=y) \qquad \text{ for all } x \text{ and } y

<p>When dealing with two or more random variables, we often use subscripts to distinguish between their probability functions. Two subscripts are used when referring to the <strong>joint</strong> probabilities for the two variables,</p>
\[
p_{X,Y}(x, y) = P(X = x \textbf{ and } Y = y)
\]
<div class="boxed">
	<p style="text-align:left; font-weight:normal">Discrete random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are therefore independent when</p>
	\[
	p_{X,Y}(x, y) = p_X(x) \times p_Y(y) \qquad \text{ for all } x \text{ and } y
	\] </div>
<p class="heading">Proving independence</p>
<p>In some scenarios, we can argue that variables <strong> should</strong> be independent because of the way that the experiment was conducted. Otherwise, independence must be checked using the definition before we can be sure that two variables are independent.</p>
<p>To <strong>prove</strong> independence, it is necessary to show that <strong>all</strong> combinations of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> satisfy the relationship, but it is only necessary to find a <strong>single</strong> combination that does not work to prove that <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are <strong>not</strong> independent.</p>
