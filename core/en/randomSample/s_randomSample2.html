<p class="heading">Independent repetitions of an experiment</p>

<p>One important situation that leads to independent random variables is when some random experiment is repeated  in essentially the same way.</p>
<p>If the experiment is repeated twice, it is usually reasonable to assume that the resulting two variables are not only independent, but also both have the same distribution. This allows us to dispense with the subscripts for their probability functions,</p>
\[
p_X(\cdot) \;=\; p_Y(\cdot) \;=\; p(\cdot)
\]

<p>If this is extended to \(n\) independent repetitions of a random experiment, we get  \(n\) independent identically distributed random variables. These are often abbreviated to  <strong>iidrv</strong>'s and are also called a <strong>random sample</strong> from the distribution with probability function \(p(x)\).</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>A <strong>random sample</strong> of  \(n\) values from a distribution is a collection of  \(n\) independent random variables, each of which has this distribution.</p>
</div>

<p>Random samples often arise in statistics, and the following theorem is central to their analysis.</p>

<div class="theoremProof">
	<div class="theorem">
		<p class="theoremTitle">Probabilities for random samples</p>
		<p>The probability that the values in a discrete random sample are \(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\) is</p>
		\[
		P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, ..., X_n = x_n) \;\; = \;\; \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i)
		\]
