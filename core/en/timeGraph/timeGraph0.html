<p class="heading">Display of a time series</p>
<p>We often want to describe how measurements change over time. For example, trends 
in AIDS rates, average incomes, and monthly rainfalls are important indicators 
of the success of policies in a country.</p>
<p>Such measurements can be graphed against a time axis as either a time series 
plot (similar to a scatterplot, but with successive values joined by lines), a 
series of bars (similar to a bar chart) or a coloured area between the values 
and zero.</p>

<p class="heading">Several related measurements</p>
<p>When there are several measurements at each time, they may be plotted against 
a common time axis. If the measurements have a meaningful total, a stacked bar 
chart of either raw values or percentages can be drawn at each time. The successive 
stacked bar charts are usually joined to form bands of colour.</p>

<p class="heading">Dynamic displays</p>
<p>On paper, time is usually represented by a horizontal axis. However if the 
data are displayed on a computer, any of the display types shown in previous sections 
can be made interactive display with a slider to change the time. Dynamic scatterplots 
and maps are particularly effective ways to show changed over time.</p>

<p><img src="images/overviewJunk.gif" width="135" height="113" align="right">Resist 
the temptation to publish 3-dimensional displays of time series &mdash; they generally 
show trends much less clearly than the corresponding 2-dimensional versions.</p>
