<p class="heading">Showing changes to a histogram</p>
  
<p>Many kinds of data from a single time point can be displayed as bar or pie 
charts. However a histogram is needed to graphically display a frequency table 
for a continuous measurement such as the age distribution of a population.</p>
<p>The next example shows how a histogram varies over time. It would be difficult 
to show the same information in a static display.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Ages of registered cars in New Zealand</p>

<p>The histogram below initially shows the age distribution of cars that were 
registered in New Zealand in 1998.</p>

<p>Drag the slider to see how the age distribution changed since 1998.</p>

<p class="heading">'Births' and 'deaths' of cars</p>

<p>In recent years, a high proportion of cars sold for the first time in New Zealand 
have been second-hand cars that were imported from Japan. Unlike most other countries, 
'new' cars are therefore introduced at ages 1-10 in addition to brand new cars 
at age 0.</p>
<p>The histogram below shows <span class="blue bold">in blue</span>  
how many cars of each age were more than would have been expected if the previous 
year's cars had just aged by one year (after 1998). This describes the ages of 
most cars that were new to New Zealand roads in the year.</p>
<p>In a similar way, if the number of cars of one age were <strong>less</strong> 
than would have been expected if the previous year's cars had aged by one year, 
the difference will be cars that 'died' during the year and these are displayed 
<span class="red"> <strong>in red</strong></span>.</p>

<p>Drag the slider to see why the large number of Japanese imports at ages 1-10 
have resulted in a bulge in the age distribution of cars around 10 years old.</p>

<p class="gray">(Most imported cars are less than 10 years old and most 
cars are over 10 years old when they are taken off the road. However there will 
be some overlap so the blue and red numbers actually reflect a mixture of the 
two effects.)</p>
