<p class="heading">Scatterplots</p>
  
<p>Another type of data display that can be effectively animated to show changes 
over time is a scatterplot. This is particularly useful when the crosses represent 
named items such as countries. It is sometimes possible to identify items whose 
behaviour in the dynamic scatterplot is different from that of most others.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the scatterplot for showing information about countries 
is enhanced if each is represented by a circle whose size describes population 
or some other measurement that reflects 'size' such as GDP. An extremely good 
implementation of this methodology is implemented by the <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/" target="_blank">Gapminder</a> 
software.</p>

<p>The scatterplot below shows the birth rate and life expectancy of all countries 
in Africa.</p>

<li>The trend towards lower birth rates and higher life expectancy of most countries 
up to about 1990.</li>
<li>The rapid decrease in life expectancy in Rwanda in 1995.</li>
<li>The decrease in life expectancy in many Southern African countries since about 
1995 (due to AIDS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on individual crosses to identify the countries and leave a trace of 
their progress over the period.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Display values as circles</strong> from the pop-up menu on the 
bottom right. This displays each country as a circle whose area represents the 
country's population. This dynamic display is particularly effective at showing 
the changing birth rates and life expectancies.</p>
