<p class="heading">Normal distribution parameters</p>
	<p>The mean, µ, 
		of normal populations is usually of most interest, but we may also want to estimate:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>standard deviation</li>
		<li>interquartile range (upper quartile - lower quartile)</li>
		<li>median</li>
		<li>other percentiles (e.g. the upper quartile)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The corresponding sample statistics provide point estimates of these parameters, but formulae for standard errors may be difficult to find.</p>
	<p class="heading">Simulation</p>
	<p>If the values of µ 
	and σ were known, we could perform a simulation with repeated samples to find the error distribution for the type of estimate that we were using. The standard deviation of the error distribution gives the standard error of the estimate.</p>
	<p>In practice, µ 
	and σ are unknown, but we can perform a similar simulation, replacing them with the sample mean and standard deviation.</p>
	<p class=heading>Example</p>
<p>Low assets-to-liabilities ratios are usually regarded as undesirable for companies. We
want to find the assets-to-liabilities ratio that  only one in four
healthy companies will not meet &mdash;
i.e the <strong>lower
quartile</strong> of
the distribution. The diagram below shows the assets-to-liabilities ratios
of a sample of 68 healthy Greek companies and the point estimate of the lower
quartile.</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/assetLiabilitiesLQ.gif" width="396" height="136"></p>
<p>The assets-to-liabilities ratios have a fairly symmetric distribution and
the diagram below shows a normal distribution whose mean and standard deviation
are the same as those of our actual data.</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/assetLiabilitiesModel.gif" width="396" height="136"></p>
<p>This approximate normal distribution has lower quartile 1.295, so we can perform
a simulation with samples of <em>n</em> = 68 values from this distribution and
find how far the sample lower quartiles are from this theoretical value &mdash; the
error distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_normalSim_c.gif" width="339" height="240"></p>
	<p>From the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb, the error has approximately 95% chance of being within 2 s.e. of 
	zero and will be almost certainly within 3 s.e. of zero. This means that  our point estimate of the upper quartile (292 secs) is likely to be less than 9 sec from the underlying population parameter and will be almost certain to be less than 13.5 sec from it.</p>
