<p class="heading">Estimating other parameters of a normal population</p>

<p>In normal populations, the mean, µ, 
	is the parameter that is most often estimated. However numerical distributions 
	have other parameters that may be of interest. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>standard deviation</li>
	<li>interquartile range (upper quartile - lower quartile)</li>
	<li>median</li>
	<li>other percentiles (e.g. the upper quartile)</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters can be estimated using the corresponding summary statistic 
	from a random sample, but the error distribution may be difficult to obtain 
	theoretically.</p>
<p class="heading">Simulation</p>
<p>Since the parameters µ 
	and σ 
	are unknown, we cannot perform a simulation with repeated samples from the 
	actual population. However we can conduct a simulation from our best estimate 
	of the population distribution &mdash; i.e. replacing µ 
	and σ 
	with the sample mean and standard deviation.</p>
<p>We repeatedly take samples of size <em>n</em> from this approximate population 
	and evaluate the estimation error from using each sample. (Since we know the 
	population from which we are sampling, we know the population parameter and 
	can find the estimation error.)</p>
<p>The standard deviation of these errors is the approximate standard error 
	of the estimator.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Silkworm poisoning">
	<p class=heading>Silkworm poisoning</p>

	<p>In an experiment to investigate the toxic action of arsenic, 80 fourth-instar 
		silkworm larvae weighing between 0.41 and 0.45 grams were given 0.10 mg 
		of sodium arsenate per gram of body weight.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How long will one in four of the larvae survive?<strong> 
					</strong></p>
</div></div>

	<p> In other words, we want to estimate the <strong>upper quartile</strong> 
		of the survival times.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/silkwormUQ.gif" width="396" height="136"></p>
	<p>The above dot plot shows the survival times and their upper quartile. Assuming 
		that these silkworms are a random sample,&nbsp;...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>...&nbsp;we <strong><strong>estimate</strong> 
					that the population upper quartile is 292 seconds &mdash; i.e. we predict 
					that 1 in 4 silkworms of this type will survive for 292 seconds</strong>.<strong> 
					</strong></p>
</div></div>

	
	<p class=heading>Approximate population</p>
	<p>The survival times have a fairly symmetric distribution so it is reasonable 
		to try simulating random samples from a normal population. The diagram below 
		shows a normal distribution whose mean and standard deviation equal those 
		of our actual data.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/silkwormModel.gif" width="388" height="128"></p>
	<p>We use this normal distribution as a population from which to sample 80 
		values &mdash; simulated survival times for 80 silkworms given the same dose 
		of arsenic. For the normal (272.6, 30.7) distribution, the upper quartile 
		is 293.3, so this is the 'target' parameter that is estimated by our simulated 
		samples. </p>

<p>The diagram initially shows a sample of 80 survival times. The error is 
	the difference between the sample upper quartile and the underlying population 
	parameter, 293.3 sec.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times and observe that the error 
	varies from sample to sample.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then take 100 or more samples (survival 
	times of 80 silkworms). The error distribution is built up as a stacked 
	dot plot at the bottom of the diagram.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The distribution of errors gives an idea 
				of how far the upper quartile of our actual survival times (292 sec) 
				is likely to be from the true unknown population upper quartile.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Estimate s.e. and bias</strong> to see the standard deviation 
	and mean of the error distribution.</p>
<p class=heading>Understanding accuracy of estimate</p>

<p>In the simulation, you should have observed that the bias of the estimator 
	is small, so we will treat it as zero.</p>
<p>The estimated standard error in your simulation was probably just over 
	4&nbsp;sec. We can use the 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb to help interpret its 
	value &mdash; the error has approximately 95% chance of being within 2 s.e. of 
	zero and will be almost certainly within 3 s.e. of zero.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The error in our estimate of the population upper quartile, 
				292&nbsp;sec, is likely to be less than 8&nbsp;sec and will almost 
				certainly be less than 12&nbsp;sec.</p>
