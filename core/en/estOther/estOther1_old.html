<p class=heading>Standard errors and CIs from formulae</p>

<p>Simple formulae can be found for the standard errors of sample means and 
	proportions. Formulae exist for the standard errors of most commonly used 
	parameter estimates, though some require computer software to evaluate.</p>
<p>For any such estimator, an approximate 95% confidence interval can be found 
	from</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><em>estimate</em> - 2 
				<em>s.e.</em><em>&nbsp; </em>&nbsp;to <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;estimate</em> 
				+ 2 <em>s.e.</em></p>
</div></div>

<p>(The confidence interval can sometimes be improved by replacing the constant 
	2 with a slightly different value.)</p>

<p class=heading>If no formula for the SE is available...</p>

<p>For some estimators, there is no formula for the standard error, or no available 
	software can evaluate it. In this situation, a different approach is needed.</p>
<p>In this section, we describe how simulations can be used to assess the accuracy 
	of such estimators.</p>

<div class="diagram">
	<p class=heading>October rainfall in Samaru, Northern Nigeria</p>
	<p>In most of Africa, the most important climatic variable is rainfall. A 
		better understanding of the distribution of rainfall can affect the crops 
		that are grown and when they are planted.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>What is the October rainfall that is reached in 1 out of 
					4 years in Samaru, Nigeria?</p>
</div></div>

	<p>In other words, we want to <strong>estimate the upper quartile</strong> 
		of the October rainfall distribution in Samaru.</p>
	<p>The diagram below shows October rainfall for the 56 years between 1928 
		and 1983.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/samaruOctUQ.gif" width="397" height="130"></p>
	<p>The distribution is very skew &mdash; seven years had no rain at all in October 
		and several others had extremely low rainfall, but there was quite high 
		rainfall in a few years. The upper quartile of the rainfall distribution 
		was 57.4 mm.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If the rainfall distribution remains the same as in the 
					past, we would <strong>estimate</strong> rainfall of 57.4&nbsp;mm 
					or more in one out of every four Octobers.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There are no convenient formulae for the standard error of this type of 
		estimator, so a simulation is needed to find its standard error.</p>
