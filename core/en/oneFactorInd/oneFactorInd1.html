<p class="heading">Simple experiments with one factor</p>
	<p>Industrial experiments often try to assess the effects of several factors on a response and their design can be complex. We will build up to this complexity  gradually, starting with relatively simple experiments. The most fundamental aspect of all experiments is that we apply <strong>treatments</strong> to experimental units, so we initially concentrate on the simplest type of experiment in which:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a single factor is varied, and</li>
		<li>nothing is known about  differences between the  experimental units before the experiment is started.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In laboratory and engineering experiments, it is often possible to use fairly homogeneous experimental units, so the second requirement is often met.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>The concepts and methods that are introduced in this chapter are the basis for  design and analysis of more complex experiments  in later chapters.</p>
</div></div>
	<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>  
  <p>If nothing is known about differences between the experimental units, the best way to conduct the experiment is to allocate the factor levels (treatments) <strong>at random</strong> to the experimental units. We showed earlier that <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('aboutExper3')">non-random allocation of treatments can result in misleading estimates</a> of their effects. In many experiments, the same number of experimental units is used for each level of the factor but this is not essential.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
    <p>This type of experimental  is called a <strong>completely randomised experiment</strong>.</p>
  </div></div>
  
  <p>The repeat measurements at each factor level are called <strong>replicates</strong>.</p>
  <div class="diagram">
  	<p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
	
<p>A key aspect of a completely randomised experiment is the random allocation of treatments to experimental units. The diagram below illustrates this randomisation for an experiment with 6 replicates for each of the 5 factor levels.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Randomise experiment</strong> to randomly allocate the treatments  to experimental units.</p>
<p>Notice that the six replicates of <em>Level 1</em> are equally likely to be used in any six of the experimental units. If the treatments are allocated to the experimental units in any other way, the design is <strong>not</strong> a completely randomised one. For example, if treatments are allocated to ensure that all three units in a row  get the same treatment, the design is not completely randomised.</p>
<p class="heading">Examples</p>
<p>A few examples of completely randomised experiments are shown below.</p>
