<p class="heading">Reasons for variability in the response</p>
<p>In a completely randomised experiment, there are two potential reasons for variability in 
	the response.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>The different factor levels</dt>
  <dd>Changing the value of a factor can result in changes to 
    the response. The purpose of the experiment is to assess the magnitude of 
    these changes. This is called <strong>explained</strong> variation since 
    it can be explained in terms of the explanatory factor.</dd>
  <dt>Other differences between the experimental units</dt>
  <dd>There is usually natural variability between the experimental units and 
    in the measurement process. Two response measurements at the same factor level will usually differ. This natural variability 
    cannot be explained in terms of the factor and is called <strong>unexplained</strong> 
    variation.</dd>
