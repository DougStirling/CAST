<p class="heading">Time-ordering of univariate data</p>

  <p>Some data sets may appear to be univariate, but the measurements are made sequentially 
		in time. For example, many demographic and economic measurements are recorded 
		monthly or annually. A data set of this form is called a <strong>time series</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>Treating time as an additional numerical variable allows the data to be treated as bivariate. In particular, a scatterplot of the variable against time is called a <strong>time series plot</strong>.</p>

<p>Time series data can be displayed and analysed with many of 
				the techniques that are used for bivariate data.</p>
