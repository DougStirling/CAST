<p class="heading">Time-ordering of univariate data</p>
	<p>Some data sets are apparently univariate, but the measurements are made sequentially 
		in time.  A data set of this form is called a <strong>time series</strong>.</p>
	<p>The time at which each measurement was made may be treated as an additional 
		numerical variable, and the measurement can then be plotted against time. 
		This type of scatterplot is often called a <strong>time series plot</strong>.</p>
