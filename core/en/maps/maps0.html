<p><img src="images/ausShaded.gif" width="103" height="95" align="right">When 
measurements are made from different geographical regions, we are often interested 
in whether adjacent regions have similar values. Colouring the regions of a map 
to represent the values is an effective way to display the geographical spread 
of the measurement.</p>
<p class="heading">Circles</p>
<p><img src="images/ausCircles.gif" width="103" height="95" align="right">A major 
problem with colouring regions on a map is that large regions are very prominent, 
even if they are sparsely populated. A solution is to superimpose coloured circles 
on a standard map whose areas are proportional to a better measure of their sizes 
(e.g. population or GDP).</p>
<p class="heading">Pie and bar charts</p>
<p><img src="images/ausBars.gif" width="103" height="95" align="right">More complex 
displays such as pie charts and bar charts can be draw over each region of a map 
to show the geographical distribution of other information. However these displays 
can easily become too cluttered with information if there are many regions or 
complex displays for each region.</p>
<p class="heading">Distorted maps</p>
<p><img src="images/ausDiostort.gif" width="103" height="95" align="right">Another 
way to represent 'size' information on a map is to distort the boundaries of the 
regions to make their areas proportional to the values. These distorted maps are 
used to represent populations, but can also be used for other 'quantity' values 
such as GDP or rainfall. If the distortion is too great, the regions can be difficult 
to identify.</p>
