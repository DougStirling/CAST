<p class="heading">Distorting maps to display other information</p>
  
<p>Maps can be similarly distorted to make the areas of countries (or regions) 
proportional to many other measurements.</p>
<p>Map areas must represent a quantity that is 'part of a whole'. If two areas 
are combined, the value for the combined area should be the sum of their values.</p>
<p>For example, area should not be proportional to infant mortality rate in the 
countries &mdash; this would give unreasonable emphasis to very small countries. A 
better measurement to use for the map areas of countries would be the total number 
of infants dying.</p>
<p class="heading">WorldMapper</p>
<p>It is far from simple to construct such distorted maps, but software has been 
written to automatically produce them. The following maps were all drawn by <a href="http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper" target="_blank">WorldMapper</a>. 
Although the resulting maps occasionally produce spidery distortions, the result 
is often excellent.</p>

<p class="heading">Rainfall volume</p>

<p>The map below shows where the world's rainfall occurs. Observe in particular 
the high rainfall in Brazil and Indonesia.</p>

<p class="heading">Electricity generation</p>
<p>The next map shows where the world's electricity is generated. The distortion 
of the shapes of countries in Africa is particularly severe.</p>
