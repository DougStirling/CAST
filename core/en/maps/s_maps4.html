<p class="heading notPrinted">Adding other information to maps</p>

can  be superimposed on the regions of a map, but they must be simple to
be effective. </p>
<p>The bar charts below  show clearly that a larger proportion of companies
in New Zealand were foreign-owned in Auckland and Wellington than those in the
rest of the country. The increase in companies based in Auckland
rather than Wellington and the increasing proportion of foreign-owned companies
in Auckland in 1997 are evident.</p>
