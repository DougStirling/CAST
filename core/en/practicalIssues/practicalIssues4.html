<p class="heading">Human subjects</p>

<p>There are a few practicalities that complicate matters when data are collected from human subjects, but that do not arise in other kinds of survey or experiment. The problems are different in surveys and experiments so we will treat them separately.</p>
<p class="heading">Non-response in surveys</p>
<p>In some official surveys, there is a legal requirement to participate but in most surveys a proportion of the sampled individuals will refuse to answer questions. Different types of survey have different non-response rates &mdash; for example, more people respond to questions from an interviewer than from a postal survey.</p>
<p>The response rate can be 20% or lower in some surveys and if people responding have different characteristics from those who refuse, the survey results can be biased. It is therefore important to put considerable effort into achieving a high response rate.</p>
<p class="heading">Questionnaire design</p>
<p>In a survey of humans, the questions must be very carefully worded to avoid ambiguities. Questions about age, income and sexual relationships will be considered too personal by some respondents and it is often more acceptable to ask for ages and incomes to be specified in broad groups rather than exactly. Questionnaire design is difficult and a pilot survey with a small number of respondents often shows up problems.</p>
<p>It is  best to limit the questionnaire to a small number of well-designed questions that address the aims of the project. Large questionnaires that try to cover too much ground often suffer from a large non-response rate.</p>
<p class="heading">Ethical issues in experiments</p>
<p>A different range of issues arise with experiments that involve humans.</p>
<p>For ethical reasons, experiments involving potential danger to the subjects are not
	possible. Even if there is no known danger, the subjects should be aware of what is
	involved in the experiment and must give informed consent.</p>
<p class=heading> Placebos</p>

<p>The act of administering a treatment to a human subject may itself
affect the response, irrespective of the treatment effect. For example, if a drug
is being assessed for its ability to reduce headaches, the knowledge that medication
has been administered may make the subject feel better, even if the drug has no active
ingredient.
</p>

<p>To avoid the psychological effect of the treatment on the subject being confounded 
with the effect of the drug, an indistinguishable 'treatment' with no effect may 
be given to a control group of subjects; this is called a <strong>placebo</strong>. 
For example, two batches of pills of similar size and taste may be prepared, with 
only one batch containing the active ingredient being assessed. Any difference 
between the control group and the treatment group can therefore be attributed 
to the treatment. </p>

<p class=heading> Double-blind experiments</p>

<p>A further complication may arise when the measured response from each subject
may be affected by knowledge of the treatment applied. If the experimenter knows
which treatment has been applied to each experimental unit, there may be a
subconscious tendency to systematically over- or under-assess one treatment.
To avoid this potential problem, the researcher may be unaware of which
experimental units received which treatment until after the experiment.
</p>

<p>The experiment is called <strong>double-blind</strong> if neither the researcher 
not the subject knows which treatment has been applied. For example, a third party 
may randomly decide which of two drugs will be given to each subject, and package 
the appropriate pills for each subject in unlabelled containers. The researcher 
would administer the treatments and record results without knowing which subjects 
were receiving which treatments.</p>
