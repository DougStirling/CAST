<p class=heading> Problem</p>

<p>Projects are usually conducted to solve practical problems. The context, relevant background information and the problem itself should be written down. Obtaining general agreement that this statement really does describe the problem 
is imperative.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>A clear statement of the problem may lead to  improvements without 
		any data being collected, simply through creating a greater understanding of the process.</p>
</div></div>
<p class=heading>Aim</p>
<p>Any research project should begin with well-defined objectives. If the researcher has no clear idea of the objectives of the study, it is unlikely 
	that the data collected will contain suitable information.</p>
<p>It is essential that the researcher has a clear idea of what an experiment 
is being conducted to achieve. In defining the goals of the experiment, it is 
important that people with intimate knowledge of the process or subject area are 
included in the team which is charged with designing and running the experiment.</p>

<p class=heading>Specific objectives</p>
<p class="style5">The objectives of a research
	project should be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>clear and unambiguous</li>
	<li>complete</li>
	<li>relevant to the researchable problem</li>
	<li>capable of being met by some type of study
			(experiment, survey, a series of experiments, ....)</li>
</ul>

<p>This cannot be stressed enough. Objectives drive the
	rest of the study: your hypothesis, the kind of study that needs to be
	done (experiment, survey, ....), the treatments that have to be
	compared, the population to be sampled, the data to be collected, the
	formal statistical analysis needed, ....</p>
<p>Making a vague statement such as "The objective
	is to compare treatments" is the same as setting no objectives at
	all. Information about "what?", "who?",
	"when?", "where?", "how many?", "how
	much?", .... should be incorporated in the study objectives. </p>
<p> Following objective is a real life example from a first draft of a
	research proposal:</p>
	<p style="margin-left:60px;"><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate 4 improved mango varieties.</p>
<p>In
        the final research proposal, this had been improved to following clear
  statement from which the next steps to be taken flow automatically:</p>
	<p style="margin-left:60px;"><strong>Objective:</strong>		To determine whether the survival and growth rates, during the first two
		years, of improved mango varieties (Kent, Van Dyke, Tommy Atkins and
		Sensation) can be brought up to the level of the local variety by using
		a higher level of management (manure and water), when these trees are
		grown in crop fields of the coffee zone of Embu, Kenya.</p>

<p class=heading>Actions?</p>
<p class="style5">Before data are collected, it is also important to consider how the results from the project will be used. The goal may be simply to publish a paper in a specific journal, but  there should be a plan for how the results can be used improve some aspect of the real world.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>If the conclusions from the project will not have any effect on the outside world, why bother?</p>
</div></div>
