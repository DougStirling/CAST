<p class="heading notPrinted">Making all block means equal</p>
<p>Our model for randomised block data explains the effect of the blocks on <em>Y</em> as
a  addition  of a &quot;block effect&quot; to all values within each block. This
suggests eliminating differences between the blocks by adjusting the values in all
blocks to have the same block means.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>The diagram below shows results from an experiment with blocks of size five and
five treatments. Different colours are used for the different blocks and the block
means are shown with vertical lines.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_blockMeans.gif" width="482" height="217"></p>
<p>A lot of the variability in the response, <em>Y</em>, is caused by differences
between the blocks. The diagram below adjusts the values by adding a constant to
all values in each block, givving all blocks the same mean response.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_blockSameMeans.gif" width="482" height="217"></p>
<p>Since there is now much less 'unexplained' variation and there are now no differences
between blocks, applying the standard anova test for equal treatment means to the
adjusted data seems reasonable and is much more sensitive to treatment differences:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_adjustedAnova.gif" width="387" height="87"></p>
<p>The treatment and residual sums of squares shown here are the <strong>basis</strong> for
testing whether the treatment means are  equal, but the analysis is not completely
correct.</p>

<tr>
<td align="center" class="darkred bold">The  residual degrees of freedom
are too high.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>The correct analysis of variance table for testing equal treatment
means is a little more complex for randomised block data; it will be explained in
the following pages.</p>
