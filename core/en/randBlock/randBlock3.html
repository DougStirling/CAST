<p class="heading">Testing for equal treatment means</p>

<p>In many data sets, there is no baseline treatment against which we might 
want to compare the other treatments. It is then unwieldy to analyse the data 
with confidence intervals for differences between all pairs of treatments.</p>
<p>Analysis should start with a single hypothesis test for whether all treatment 
means are equal.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Independent samples</dt>
<dd>If there is an independent sample from each treatment, we can perform 
	a combined test for differences between the treatment means using a multi-group 
	Analysis of Variance (anova) table, as described earlier in this chapter.</dd>
<dt>Linked samples</dt>
<dd>For data like the blocked and repeated measures examples on the previous 
	page, this anova table should not be used. We will explain the details of 
	a new test based on a modified anova table in the remainder of this section, 
	but only mention at this stage that such a test exists and provides a p-value 
	for testing whether the treatment means are equal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the following example, the p-value is shown and interpreted. </p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Grazing cattle in Uganda">
<p class="heading">Grazing cattle in Uganda</p>

<p>As part of study on the habits of Zebu cattle in Uganda, observers recorded 
	the time that each animal was grazing. In order to compare how accurately 
	the observers made these measurements, an experiment was conducted in which 
	five observers simultaneously watched the same group of 10 cattle for 88 
	minutes in one afternoon. Each person reported the number of minutes that 
	each animal was observed grazing.</p>

	<dd>The same cattle were counted by all observers, so a different test should
