<p class="heading">Testing for equal treatment means</p>

<p>If there is no baseline treatment, it is unwieldy to analyse the data 
with confidence intervals for differences between  pairs of treatments. Analysis should start with a single hypothesis test for whether all treatment 
means are equal.</p>
<p>If there are independent samples from  treatments, we can test for differences between the treatment means with the analysis of variance test described in the previous section. For randomised block and repeated measures data, a <strong>different</strong> type of test should be used.</p>
