<p>In paired data, each of the two treatments is used once within each block (pair).
The previous
pages generalised this to more than two treatments, but each treatment was still
used once in each block. We now generalise further to allow the
block
size to be any multiple of the number of treatments.</p>
<p class="heading">Reducing unexplained variability</p>
<p>To assess the significance of differences between experimental treatments, variation
in the treatment means is compared to the amount of unexplained (random) variation.
With less unexplained variation, there is less chance of the differences between
treatment means having arisen by chance. There are two ways to reduce unexplained
variation:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Use experimental units that are as similar as possible.</dt>
<dd>Identical experimental units cannot usually be found but similar experimental
units give best accuracy.</dd>
<dt>Group the experimental units into blocks of similar units.</dt>
<dd>If the experimental units vary but can be grouped into blocks of similar units,
then these blocks 'explain' some of the variability, and unexplained variability
is reduced.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The simplest way to use blocks in an experiment is with a <strong>randomised block
design</strong>. In this, the block size is a multiple of the number of treatments.
Each treatment is used for the same number of experimental units within each block,
and the treatments are randomly allocated to units within the blocks.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted in which the experimental units were intestinal preparations
from fish, but each fish would only give six preparations. The six preparations from
each fish constitute a block of units. Two treatments were used, with  the six preparations
from each of four fish randomly split into three preparations for each treatment
(a randomised block experiment).</p>
<p style="color:#F00; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0px">Wrong
analysis</p>
<p style="margin-top:5px">Ignoring possible differences between the four fish and
treating the data as a completely randomised experiment with 24 experimental units,
we would conclude that there is moderately strong evidence of a difference between
the two treatments.</p>

<p style="color:#F00; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0px">Correct
analysis</p>
<p style="margin-top:5px">There are considerable differences between the four fish
(blocks), with much lower variability within any single fish. The correct analysis
is explained later in this section and the resulting p-value gives much stronger
evidence of a difference between the two treatments.</p>
