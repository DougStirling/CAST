<p class="heading">A simple analysis</p>
<p>If there are <em>g</em> treatments (or repeated measures) in the data, different 
pairs of treatments from the <em>g</em> can be analysed as paired data. For 
example, we can calculate the differences between the two selected treatments 
and find a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the treatment 
means, as described in the previous section.</p>
<p>There are <em>g</em>(<em>g</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)/2 possible pairs of treatments 
that can be compared and this quickly becomes unmanageable if the number of 
treatments, <em>g</em>, is large. However in some data sets, we can restrict 
attention to a smaller number of comparisons:</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If one of the <em>g</em> 
		treatments is a standard or baseline treatment, we can compare the other 
<em>g</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 treatments to this baseline.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Later in this section, we will explain how to simultaneously compare all 
treatments, but we first show two examples in which paired confidence intervals 
are used.</p>

<p class="heading">Codeine and acupuncture for dental pain relief</p>

<p>In a randomised block experiment, 32 subjects were grouped into blocks 
	of four according to an initial assessment of their tolerance to pain. Four 
	pain relief treatments were randomly allocated to the four patients in each 
	group and pain relief scores were recorded from each subject two hours after 
	dental treatment.</p>

<p class="heading">Effect of nicotine on tics</p>

<p>This repeated measures experiment involved 10 patients with Tourette's 
	syndrome, a neurological disorder that results in tics. The number of tics 
	was recorded during an initial 30-minute period (baseline), then during 
	30 minutes of chewing nicotine gum (containing 2 mg nicotine), from 0 to 
	30 minutes after chewing, and finally from 30 to 60 minutes after chewing.</p>
