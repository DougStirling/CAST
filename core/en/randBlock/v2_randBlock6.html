<p class="heading">Making all block means equal</p>

<p>We showed earlier that it is poor to test for equal treatment means with 
	an Analysis of Variance (anova) table that ignores the blocks. The extra variability 
	in the response that is caused by differences between the blocks makes it 
	far harder to detect treatment differences.</p>
<p>Adding or subtracting a value from each block to make all block means equal 
	would get rid of the differences between the blocks. Although the resulting 
	anova table is not completely correct for testing whether the treatment means 
are equal, its sums of squares are the <strong>basis</strong> for the test.</p>

<p>The treatment and residual sums of squares shown above are the <strong>basis</strong> 
for testing whether the treatment means are all equal. However:</p>

<div class="boxed" style="background-color:#FFFF00">
<p><span class="darkred">The analysis described 
			on this page is not completely correct &mdash; the residual degrees of freedom 
			are too high.</span></p>
</div>

<p>We will next describe the correct anova table for testing equal treatment 
	means with randomised block data.</p>
