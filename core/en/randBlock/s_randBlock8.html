<p class="heading notPrinted">Anova table</p>
<p>The three components that add to total sum of squares 
are usually laid out in an <strong>analysis of variance</strong> table
(or simply <strong>anova</strong> table).</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/randBlockAnovaTable.gif" width="592" height="186"> </p>
<p>The anova table adds a few extra columns:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Degrees of freedom</dt>
<dd>They also add up to the value in the <em>Total</em> row, (<em>n</em> &minus; 1).</dd>
<dt>Mean sums of squares</dt>
<dd>These are the sums of squares divided by their degrees of freedom.</dd>
<dt>F-ratios</dt>
<dd>For the blocks and treatments, the F-ratio divides the mean sum of squares by
the mean residual sum of squares.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">Tests</p>
<p>The F-ratio for differences between the treatments compares the variability explained
by the treatments to the residual (unexplained) variation. The larger the F-ratio,
the stronger the evidence for a difference between treatments. A formal hypothesis
test is based on the F-ratio and its p-value is the probability of getting as big
an F-ratio as that recorded if all treatment means were equal. It is interpreted
in the same way as all other p-values.</p>
<dl>
<dt>p-value &gt; 0.1</dt>
<dd>No evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
<dt>0.1 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.05</dt>
<dd>Very mild evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
<dt>0.05 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.01</dt>
<dd>Moderately strong evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
<dt>p-value &lt; 0.01</dt>
<dd> Strong evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
</dl>
<p>A p-value can also be found to test whether there are differences between the
blocks, but this is usually of less interest.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In practice, computer software will produce the anova table for you, so you only
need to interpret the p-value associated with the treatments.</p>
