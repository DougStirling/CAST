<p class="heading notPrinted">Testing for equal treatment means</p>
<p>If  there is no baseline treatment, analysis should start with a single hypothesis
test for whether all treatment means are equal. The standard multi-group analysis
of variance test for equal means in a completely randomised experiment (ignoring
the blocks) should <strong>not</strong> be used for experiments with
blocks.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>Ignoring the existence of blocks makes it much harder to detect differences
between treatments.</p></div></div>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>Five different observers each watched the same group of 10 cattle and reported
how long each animal spent grazing.</p>
<p style="color:#F00; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0px">Wrong analysis</p>
<p style="margin-top:5px">Ignoring the fact that the same animals were observed by all five observers, the
data would be analysed with the anova table below. From the large p-value, we would
conclude that there were no differences between the observers.</p>

<p style="color:#F00; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0px">Correct analysis</p>
<p style="margin-top:5px">Much of the variability in the data is due to differences
between the animals (blocks),
and an analysis that ignores this is much less sensitive to differences between the
observers. We will not explain the correct test for blocked data until later in this
section, but it gives a p-value that is interpreted in the same way as the p-value
above. It is shown below and
shows that there are almost certainly differences between the observers.</p>
