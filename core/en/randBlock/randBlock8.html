<p class="heading">Anova table</p>

  <p>The total sum of squares can be split into three component sums of squares.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/ssqEqn.gif" width="453" height="50"> 
	</p>
	<p>These sums of squares are usually laid out in an <strong>analysis of variance</strong> 
		table (or simply <strong>anova</strong> table).</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/randBlockAnovaTable.gif" width="592" height="186"> 
	</p>
	<p>The anova table adds a few extra columns:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Degrees of freedom</dt>
		<dd>The degrees of freedom for block and treatment are the number of blocks 
			or treatments minus one. The residual degrees of freedom is the total degrees 
			of freedom minus the block and treatment degrees of freedom.</dd>
		<dt>Mean sums of squares</dt>
		<dd>These are the sums of squares divided by their degrees of freedom.</dd>
		<dt>F-ratios</dt>
		<dd>For the blocks and treatments, the F-ratio divides the mean sum of squares 
			by the mean residual sum of squares.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class="heading">Tests</p>
	<p>The treatment sum of squares depends on the differences between the treatment 
		means and the overall mean. There is strongest evidence of differences between 
		the treatments if the treatment sum of squares is large, relative to the residual 
		sum of squares. </p>
	<p>The F-ratio for the treatments contains this information in a form that can 
		be used for a formal hypothesis test for whether the mean response varies 
		between treatments.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If there are no differences 
				between the treatments, the F-ratio would be expected to be around 1. 
				Larger values of F suggest that the treatments differ.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The F-ratio for the blocks holds evidence about whether the blocks differ, 
		but it is the F-ratio for treatments that is usually of most interest.</p>
	<p class="heading">P-values and tests</p>
	<p>A hypothesis test for whether there are differences between the treatments 
		is based on the F-ratio for treatments. It asks whether the F-ratio for treatments 
		is unusually high by comparing the F-ratio to a type of standard distribution 
		called an F distribution &mdash; the p-value for treatments is the probability 
		of getting such a high F-ratio if all treatments were really identical.</p>
	<p>This p-value is often added to the anova table. It is interpreted in a similar 
		way to other p-values:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>p-value &gt; 0.1</dt>
		<dd>No evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
		<dt>0.1 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.05</dt>
		<dd>Very mild evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
		<dt>0.05 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.01</dt>
		<dd>Moderately strong evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
		<dt>p-value &lt; 0.01</dt>
		<dd> Strong evidence of a difference between treatments</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>A similar p-value can be used to test whether there are any differences between 
		the blocks.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In practice, computer 
					software will produce the anova table for you, so you only need to interpret 
					the p-value associated with the treatments.</p>
</div></div>
