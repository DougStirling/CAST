<p class="heading">Three or more variables</p>
	<p>We previously described the relationship between two numerical variables, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The correlation coefficient summarises the strength of their relationship.</li>
		<li>The least squares line summarises the 'shape' of the relationship &mdash; it 
			can be used to predict <em>Y</em> from <em>X</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In many applications, more than two measurements are made from each individual and the  additional variables may throw light on the relationship.</p>
	<p>Use of this extra information may lead to  more accurate predictions of <em>Y</em>.</p>
