<p class="heading">Comparing the populations</p>

<p>For two-group data sets, we usually want to compare the underlying populations. 
In particular, the main questions of interest are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the two population distributions the same?</li>
<li>If the populations are different, how big is the difference?</li>
</ul>
<p class="heading">Comparing the population means</p>

  
  <p>The two standard deviations in the groups may differ, but we are usually 
    more interested in differences between the population means. The earlier questions 
    can be asked in terms of the difference between these means,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black">&delta; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &mu;<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;&minus;&nbsp; &mu;<sub>1</sub></span></p>
<p>If the group means are equal (and µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> 
is therefore zero), then values from neither group are higher than from the other, 
on average. Indeed, if the distributions are normal and σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub> are also equal, then a zero value for µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> also implies that the distributions in the two groups are identical. </p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> 
describes how much higher the values in group 2 are (on average) than the values 
in group 1.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The best estimate of µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> is, naturally, the difference between the means of the two samples, <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>.</p>
<p class="heading">Randomness of sample difference</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span> 
cannot give a definitive answer to questions about µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub> since it is a random summary statistic &mdash; it varies from sample to sample. The 
distribution of <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span> 
must be understood before we can make any inference about µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Simulation: Effect of zinc on colds">
<p class="heading">Simulation: Effect of zinc on colds</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted on volunteers who developed a cold within the
previous  24 hours. They were randomised to take either zinc acetate lozenges
or placebo  lozenges (identical but with no active ingredient). The duration
of cold symptoms  for the subjects who received zinc had mean&nbsp;4.5 days,
and standard deviation 1.6  days. The control group's duration had mean 8.1 days,
and standard deviation&nbsp;1.8 
days.</p>
<p>We will conduct a simulated experiment based on this scenario. In the simulation, 
we will generate 'symptom durations' for 24 patients with the zinc treatment from 
a normal distribution with µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.5 and σ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.6. 
Another 24 patients in the placebo group will have normal durations with µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;8.1 
days and σ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.8 
days.</p>
<p>Note that the duration of symptoms is, on average, µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.6 
days lower for those who get the zinc lozenges.</p>
<p><span class="gray">(The normal distributions from which the data are sampled are represented by a pale blue band at µ&nbsp;±&nbsp;2σ. The narrower darker blue band    includes half of the population distribution.)</span></p>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong>, then take several samples. Observe that 
the difference between the sample means is a random quantity whose distribution 
is centred on µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.6 
days.</p>
<p>The difference in means from a single data set, <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>, 
is therefore an <strong>estimate</strong> of µ<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;µ<sub>1</sub>, 
but is unlikely to be exactly equal to it.</p>

<p>In practice, the underlying population means (and their difference) are unknown, 
and only a single sample from each group is available. The data set below is a 
typical example.</p>

<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/birthWt2.gif" width="523" height="296"></p>

<p>Without an understanding of the distribution of <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>, 
it is impossible to properly interpret what the sample difference, 0.104&nbsp;kg, 
tells you about the difference between the underlying population means.</p>
