<p class="heading notPrinted">Data from two groups</p>
<p>When data are  collected from two groups, we are usually interested in  differences
between the groups
<strong>in general</strong>. The <strong>specific</strong> individuals  are of
less interest. Questions are therefore about the characteristics of the populations
or processes that we assume <strong>underlie</strong> the
data.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/failedCo.gif" width="523" height="299" class="summaryPict"></p>
<p>The  questions do not refer to the 16 specific subjects &mdash; they ask about
whether anticipation of hypnosis affects the ventilation rate <strong>in general</strong>.
We
would like to use the answers to predict what will happen to other people.</p>
