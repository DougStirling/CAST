<p>Before conducting an experiment, several decisions must be made. These are 
    essentially non-statistical decisions that must be based on knowledge of the 
    subject area being studied, though some understanding of statistics can help 
    to guide them.</p>
	
  <p class="heading">Purpose</p>  

  <p>A clear statement of the objectives of the experiment is important. In defining 
    the goals of the experiment, it is important that people with intimate knowledge 
    of the process or subject area are included in the team that is charged with 
    designing and running the experiment.</p>
<p>Many experiments are intended to solve a problem. After recognising that there 
is a problem, it needs to be carefully defined. Stating the problem clearly and 
obtaining general agreement that this statement really does describe the problem 
is imperative. Quite frequently,... </p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A clear statement of the problem can lead to process improvement without 
any experimentation, simply through creating a greater understanding of the process.</p>
</div></div>


<p class=heading> What experimental units should be used?</p>

  <p>In some types of experiment, there is an obvious choice of experimental units. 
    For example, an experiment to assess the effect of a functional ingredient 
		of a cat food on its consumption would use individual cats as experimental 
		units.</p>
  <p>However in horticulture, the experimental units are often plots of land whose 
    area is relatively arbitrary. In a similar way, experiments on food products 
    must decide on the volume or weight of product to be used as experimental 
    units.</p>
  <p>It is desirable for experimental units to be as similar as possible, so every 
    attempt should be made to make the experimental units homogeneous. We should 
    therefore characterise the process in terms of 'nuisance' variables and endeavour 
    to find ways of minimising their variability for the experiment. </p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Variability is the enemy of the experimenter!</p>
</div></div>

  <p>Large experimental units often 'average out' the variability between experimental 
    units, but larger experimental units are also more costly.</p>
  <p class="heading">What response variable should be recorded?</p>
  <p>In an experiment, there is sometimes a single obvious response measurement 
    from an experimental unit (e.g. crop yield per square metre, concentration 
    of impurities, bacteria count), but often there are several variables which 
    can be considered as response measurements.</p>
<p>For example, in a study of how a fertiliser affects growth of tomato plants, 
how do you measure growth?</p>
<ul>
<li>Height 4 weeks after planting?</li>
<li>Change in height between weeks 2 and 5?</li>
<li>Weight of plant?</li>
<li>Dry weight of plant?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many possibilities here and a biologist would need to decide on which 
was most important from a biological perspective.</p>

  <p class=heading> Which variables should be controlled?</p>

  <p>Thought also needs to be given to which variables will be controlled in the 
    individual experimental units. In an agricultural experiment, do we only want 
    to assess the difference in yields for three crop varieties, or do we simultaneously 
    want to determine the effects of different levels of application of fertiliser?</p>
  <p>For numerical controlled variables (e.g. temperature, storage time, concentration 
    of an additive), a decision must also be made about which values should be 
    used in the experiment. These values should cover the region of practical 
    importance. </p>
	
  <p>The controlled variables and are called <strong>factors</strong> in the context 
    of an experiment. The combinations of factor values (also called factor <strong>levels</strong>) 
    that are used for different experimental units are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Each experimental unit receives some treatment.</p>
