<p class=heading>Smoothness</p>
	<p>When drawing a stem and leaf plot, the aim is for a smooth shape to the stem
and leaf plot, and this is usually achieved by between 10 and 20 rows of leaves.</p>
	<p class=heading>Drawing by hand</p>
	<p>When data are analysed on a computer, a stacked dot plot usually describes a distribution of values more clearly than a stem and leaf plot.</p>
	<p>However stem and leaf plots are easy to draw by hand:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Decide on the stems to use &mdash; usually between 10 and 20 of them.</li>
		<li>Scan down the values identifying the leaf digits and writing them against the value's stem.</li>
		<li>Finally, sort the leaves on each stem into order.<br clear="all">
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>To simplify drawing, values are truncated to give their stems and leaf digits,
not rounded. For example, 7.98 and 7.90 would both be displayed as leaf '9' on
the stem '7'.</p>
