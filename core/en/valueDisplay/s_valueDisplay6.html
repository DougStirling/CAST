<p class=heading>Need for more flexibility</p>
	<p>Sometimes basic stem and leaf plots are not flexible enough
&mdash; there would be either too many or too few rows of leaves to show the varying
density well.</p>
	<p>Repeating each stem 2 times (with leaves 0-4 on the lower copy and leaves
5-9 on the upper one) or 5 times (with leaves 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8-9 on the
different copies) gives intermediate numbers of stems.</p>
