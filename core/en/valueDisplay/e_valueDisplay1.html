<p class="heading">Basic stem and leaf plot</p>
  
<p>Drawing a stem and leaf plot is a  useful practical skill &mdash; it is a 
quick graphical display of the distribution of values in a data set when there 
is no access to a computer.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p>To draw a stem and leaf plot, a decision must be made about which digits should 
be used as stems and leaves. In the following exercise, that choice has already 
been made. (The leaf digits are drawn with a pink background.)</p>
<p>To complete the stem and leaf plot, click on each value to display its leaf 
digit on the right, then drag the leaf onto the correct stem. The leaves should 
be sorted in order to complete the stem and leaf plot.</p>

<div class="centred">
<script type="text/javascript">outputExercise("exerciseNumGraphProg.BuildStemLeafApplet", "fruitWeight,milkFat", "smallestAtBottom", document);</script>
</div>

		
<p>If you have any problems, repeat with a few different data sets.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">More complex stem and leaf plots</p>
  
<p>To properly display some distributions, the distinct stems must be split (repeated 
2 or 5 times).</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p>Again click each value in turn and drag its leaf onto the correct stem to build 
up the stem and leaf plot.</p>

<div class="centred">
<script type="text/javascript">outputExercise("exerciseNumGraphProg.BuildStemLeafApplet", "fruitWeight2,milkFat2", "smallestAtBottom", document);</script>
</div>

		
<p>Repeat until you are confident about drawing stem and leaf plots with split stems.</p>
