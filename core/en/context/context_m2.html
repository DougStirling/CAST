<p class="heading">Answering a single question</p>

  <p>The simplest application of statistics is to answer a single question in 
		the context of some practical subject area. For example,</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>In a particular hospital, are waiting lists getting longer?</li>
		<li>Are risks of crop failure (through drought) higher for maize than for 
			sorghum? </li>
		<li>Does an ultrasonic sound generator repel mice?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Answering the question involves the following steps.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/simpleProcess.gif" width="384" height="275"></p>
	
  <p>Statistics has a role to play in all stages of this process.</p>
	<p class="heading">Feedback</p>
	<p>The simple process outlined above is appropriate for some problems where 
		data collection takes a long time and cannot be repeated. For example, it 
		often takes over a year to conduct agricultural experiments &mdash; researchers 
		only have a single opportunity to do their data collection, so they had better 
		get everything right first time!</p>
	<p>In most situations, the initial question is less well defined and a single 
		pass through the process is not enough. The information obtained from the 
		initial data generate further questions and we need to collect more data to 
		help answer them. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/feedbackProcess.gif" width="324" height="275"></p>
	<p class="heading">Pilot studies</p>
	<p>Feedback is often designed into the statistical process. For example, sometimes 
		a small fraction of the data is initially collected and analysed. The information 
		obtained from this <strong>pilot study</strong> is used to refine the data 
		collection process. For example,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some questions in a survey questionnaire may be found to be ambiguous. 
			A rewording may help.</li>
		<li>When there are hot and humid conditions, an insect pest sometimes damages 
			the maize crop. In an experiment to determine the dose of insecticide to 
			kill this pest, the pilot study may use a wide range of concentrations. 
			After analysis of this pilot study, we may conduct the main study on a narrower 
			range of concentrations and therefore obtain more accurate results.</li>
		<li>Climatic data are available for 400 stations in a country. A pilot study 
			analyses data from one of these stations and presents results to four local 
			farming groups. Feedback about the usefulness of the results and their presentation 
			affects how data from the remaining stations are analysed.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The pilot study can also provide information about how much data must be 
		collected to give the desired accuracy in the main part of the study.</p>
	<p class="heading">Unexpected results</p>
	<p>Another example of feedback in the statistical process occurs when the initial 
		analysis reveals unusual or unexpected features in the data. Such features 
		may suggest further questions and therefore further data collection.</p>
