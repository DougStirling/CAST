<p class="heading">Simple series of steps</p>
<p>The simplest application of statistics addresses a single question in 
	the context of some practical subject area.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/simpleProcess.gif" width="384" height="275"></p>
	<p>Statistics has a role to play in all stages of this process.</p>
	<p class="heading">Feedback</p>
	<p>The initial question is usually less well defined and a single 
		pass through the process is not enough. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/feedbackProcess.gif" width="324" height="275"></p>
<p>An example of feedback arises when 
		a small fraction of the data is initially collected and analysed. The information 
		obtained from this <strong>pilot study</strong> is used to refine the data 
collection process.</p>
<p>Another example of feedback  occurs when the initial 
		analysis reveals unusual or unexpected features in the data. Such features 
	may suggest further questions and therefore further data collection.</p>
