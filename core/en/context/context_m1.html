<div class="centred"><p><font size="+3"><strong><font color="#CC0000">What is the purpose of Statistics?</font></strong></font></p> </div>
	<p class="heading">Data?</p>

  <p>When non-statisticians think of statistics, the first thing that usually 
		comes to mind is data. Social acquaintances are likely to expect a statistician 
		to be an expert on unemployment rates, foreign exchange rates, crime rates, 
		and other economic and social indicators. Although a statistician may have 
		had input into how these data were collected, the average statistician is 
		no more likely to know their values than anyone else in the population.</p>
	<p>Large amounts of data are routinely collected and published. Most libraries 
		have reference sections with shelves of information published by government 
		departments and industrial groups &mdash; we often wonder why so much effort was 
		expended collecting and publishing so much data!</p>
	<p>After completing an introductory statistics course, most students realise 
		that statistical analysis is also applied to smaller data sets that are collected 
		in business, biology, medicine, and most other disciplines. Modern textbooks 
		are full of such data.</p>
	
	<div class="boxed percent75"><p>Statistical analysis uses data, but <strong>the data are not the goal</strong></p></div>
	
	<p class="heading">Statistical methods?</p>
	<p>Data are the basic commodity of the statistics. Without data, there is no 
		information on which to reach conclusions or base decisions. However the information 
		in data is often not immediately obvious, especially in large data sets.</p>
		
	<div class="boxed percent75"><p>Data contain information.<br>
					<strong>The purpose of statistics is to extract information  from data</strong></p></div>
	
  <p>Large data sets must be summarised before patterns and relationships can 
    be seen &mdash; there is usually too much noise in the raw data to see the information 
    that they contain. Statistical analyses use graphical and numerical methods 
    to highlight important features of the data.</p>
		
	<p>In smaller data sets, it is less important to summarise the data &mdash; the problem 
		is usually that there is not enough information to get a clear answer to questions 
		of importance. Statistical methods are needed to describe precision and to 
		ensure that the highest precision is obtained.</p>

  <p class="heading">Context is most important</p>

  <p>Many introductory statistics courses focus on the toolkit of statistical 
		methods that is used to extract information from large and small data sets. 
		Although it is important to thoroughly understand these statistical methods, 
		<strong>users</strong> of statistics are generally interested in questions 
		in their own subject area.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An NGO is investigating whether solar cookers would be useful in a village. 
			Sunshine records contain information about the proportion of days when there 
			is adequate sunshine.</li>
		<li>A construction firm is estimating the costs for a new building project. 
			When the ground is too wet (more than 10mm falling in a day), construction 
			is delayed. How often is this likely to happen?</li>
		<li>A health department microbiologist wants to monitor whether low bacteria 
			levels in local restaurants are being maintained. Regular testing of restaurants 
			would provide data.</li>
		<li>A village wants to know whether a wind-powered pump will be useful. Wind 
			speed data would be analysed to help answer this question.</li>
		<li>A farmer wonders which of three varieties of maize to plant. Which will 
			give highest yields? Which will be most resistant to pests and diseases? 
			An experiment will provide data on which to base an answer.</li>
		<li>A farmer wants to know the risk of a dry spell at the start of the rainy 
			season. Rainfall data from local stations are available covering the past 
			50 years.</li>
		<li>A biologist wants to assess the chance of a population of 20 endangered 
			birds becoming extinct.</li>
		<li>Coffee farmers want to discover the frequency of frost damage.</li>
		<li>A rice researcher wonders when is the optimum time during the growing 
			season to administer a pesticide.</li>
	</ul>

<div class="boxed percent75"><p>Statistical methods are used to extract information from data.<br>
					However <strong>the methods themselves are not the goal</strong></p></div>

	<p><strong>The aim of statistics is to supply useful information to people whose 
		main area of expertise is <span class="red">not</span> statistics.</strong> 
		These people are not interested directly in either data or statistical methods. 
		Data are collected in order to throw light on some question of importance 
		to the engineer, biologist, climatologist, administrator, or other professional. 
		Statistical methods are only useful if they can extract information from data 
		to help answer discipline-specific questions. The underlying context is therefore 
		the most important aspect of any statistical analysis.</p>

  <p><strong>Nobody collects data unless they are interested in the context and 
		in what the data might tell them.</strong> Many students whose main interest 
		is outside statistics therefore only appreciate the subject long after they 
		have completed their 'statistical methods' course &mdash; when their job requires 
		answers that must be based on data.</p>
		
	<div class="boxed percent75"><p><strong>If you are not primarily 
					a statistician, you will appreciate statistical methods when they are 
					needed in your career!</strong></p></div>
	
	<p class="heading">Context in CAST</p>
	<p>It is easy to miss the importance of statistics if you have no personal interest 
		in the context of the data sets that you use. Even when a statistics course 
		is targeted at learners from a specific area such as commerce or engineering, 
		there is rarely a personal interest in the context of the specific data sets 
		used in the course. The best we can do is to expose you to a wide range of 
		data and contexts and assure you that the same statistical methods will be 
		equally useful for analysing data of real interest to you later.</p>
