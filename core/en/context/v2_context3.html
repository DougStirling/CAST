<p class="heading">Continuous quality improvement</p>

  <p>Continuous quality improvement is an important part of the long-term <strong>monitoring</strong> 
and <strong>improvement</strong> of the performance of the many systems. It also
involves a feedback cycle of data collection and analysis.</p>

	<p class="heading">Example: Shelf life of milk in a supermarket</p>
	<p>A supermarket sells thousands of bottles of milk each week, but occasionally
gets complaints from customers about milk quality.
How should this problem be addressed?</p>

	<p class="heading">The statistical process in other contexts</p>

	<p>In many other contexts, a similar cycle is used to obtain 'improvements' 
    in the system. For example, biologists may want to increase numbers of an 
    endangered native bird. Why are numbers decreasing? Predators, disease, habitat, 
    ...?</p>
  <p>The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle can be used to determine reasons for the decline 
    and obtain remedies.</p>
