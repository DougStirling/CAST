<p>Why is it important to study statistics? It is a tool that helps people in
a wide range of contexts to answer questions of importance to them.

<p class="heading">Examples of context</p>

<p>Here are a few scenarios in which people from different application areas
have questions that statistics can help answer.</p>


<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'context', 'contextExamples', '464', '378');</script>


<p><strong>Statistics supplies useful information to people whose 
		main area of expertise is <span class="red">not</span> statistics.</strong> 
	The underlying context is therefore
the most important aspect of any statistical analysis.</p>

<p><strong>If you are not primarily a statistician, you may only appreciate statistical
methods when they are needed later in your career!</strong></p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Context in CAST</p>
	<p>It is easy to miss the importance of statistics if you have no personal interest
in the context of the data sets that you use. The best we can do is to expose
you to a wide range of data and contexts and assure you that the same statistical
methods will be equally useful for analysing data of real interest to you later.</p>
