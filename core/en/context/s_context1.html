<p class="heading">What is the purpose of Statistics?</p>
<p>When non-statisticians think of statistics, the first thing that usually 
	comes to mind is data. Large amounts of economic, social and administrative data
are routinely collected and published. Most researchers also collect data. Statistical
analysis uses data, but <strong>the data are not the goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Data are the basic commodity of the statistics. Without data, there is no 
	information on which to reach conclusions or base decisions.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Data contain information.<br>
<strong>The purpose of statistics is to extract information from data.</strong></p>
</div></div>
<p>Large data sets must be summarised before patterns and relationships can 
	be seen. In smaller data sets, the problem 
	is usually that there is not enough information to get a clear answer to questions
of importance. Statistical methods are needed to describe precision and to ensure
that the highest precision is obtained.</p>
<p class="heading">Context</p>
<p>In general, <strong>users</strong> of statistics are neither interested in data
or in statistical methods, but are only interested in questions <strong>in their
own subject area</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The aim of statistics is to supply useful information to people whose 
	main area of expertise is <span class="red">not</span> statistics.</strong>	Statistical methods are only useful if they can extract information from data 
	to help answer discipline-specific questions. The underlying context is therefore 
	the most important aspect of any statistical analysis.</p>

<p><strong>If you are not primarily 
			a statistician, you will appreciate statistical methods when they are 
needed in your career!</strong></p>
