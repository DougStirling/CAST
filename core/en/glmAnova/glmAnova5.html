<p>We now give two additional ways to interpret the sequential sums of squares.</p>
	
	<p class="heading">Sequential changes to residuals</p>
	<p>As each explanatory variable is added to the model in turn, the residuals 
		get closer to zero &mdash; their sum of squares becomes smaller. The sequential 
		sum of squares for a variable <em>Z</em> can therefore be written in the following 
		form where the superscripts Â±Z refer to whether or not variable <em>Z</em> 
		is in the model. (There may be additional explanatory variables in the model 
		but our notation below does not mention them.)</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/ssResidChange2.gif" width="249" height="29"></p>
	<p>It is difficult to prove, but the sequential sum of squares can also be expressed 
		in terms of the changes to the individual residuals from adding the variable 
		<em>Z</em>. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/ssResidChange.gif" width="227" height="27"></p>
	<p class="heading">Sequential changes to fitted values</p>
	<p>In similar way, as each explanatory variable is added to the model in turn, 
		the fitted values get closer to the observed response values. Since the the 
		fitted values and residuals are closely related,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/residDefn.gif" width="84" height="22"></p>
	<p>it follows that the sequential sum of squares is also the sum of squares 
		of the changes to the fitted values from adding <em>Z</em>,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/ssFitChange.gif" width="227" height="27"></p>

  <div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Oxygen uptake when running</p>  
    <p>The diagram below shows how the fitted values change as variables are added 
			to the model in the order Weight, Running time, Resting heart rate, and 
			Running heart rate.</p>

		<p>Click the red arrows to calculate the difference between the fitted values 
			of successive models. The sequential sum of squares from adding the variable 
			is the sum of squares of these differences.</p>
		<p>Select <strong>Residuals</strong> from the pop-up menu and again click 
			red arrows. The sequential sum of squares can <strong>either</strong> be 
			found from the difference in residual sum of squares <strong>or</strong> 
			as the sum of squares of the individual differences.</p>
</div>
	<p class="heading">Graphical display of sequential sums of squares</p>
	<p>The above result allows us to represent sequential sums of squares graphically 
		for many models by connecting the fitted values from the models with and without 
		the variable on a plot of the data. The sequential sum of squares is the sum 
		of squares lengths of these lines.</p>
	<p>We illustrated explained sums of squares with this type of diagram in earlier 
		chapters for regression models with 1 and 2 explanatory variables, models 
		with quadratic terms and models for data with several groups. We will also 
		use similar diagrams to illustrate sequential sums of squares for more advanced 
		models. </p>
