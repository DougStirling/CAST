<p class="heading">Partitions of group totals</p>

<p>In many data sets, the values within each group are partitions of a total. 
If the values are counts (forming a frequency table), the two-way table of categories 
by groups is called a <strong>contingency table</strong>, but there are other 
tables in which the values can be treated as partitions of a group total.</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
<tr> 
<th style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">Measurement</th>
<th style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
<th style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Categories&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
<th style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">Total in group</th>
</tr>
<tr align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 
<td>Number of households</td>
<td>Region</td>
<td>Household size</td>
<td>Households in the region</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 
<td>Rainfall</td>
<td>Country</td>
<td>Months</td>
<td>Annual rainfall</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 
<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">GDP</td>
<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">Year</td>

<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">National GDP</td>

<p>Only first example above would form a contingency table but the others also 
describe partitions of a meaninful total.</p>
<p class="heading">Proportions within groups</p>
<p>If the totals vary widely in the different groups, bar charts and tables of 
the raw values often give a visual impression that is dominated by differences 
between the group totals. </p>
<p>Rather than tabulating and graphing the raw values for each group, it is more 
informative to tabulate the <strong>proportions within the groups</strong>. Each 
value in the table is therefore divided by the <strong>total for that group</strong>.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Even when the group totals are similar, it is 
often better to examine proportions rather than the raw values.</p>

<p class="heading">Severity of injuries on New Zealand roads</p>

<p>In New Zealand, there is a legal obligation to report traffic accidents in 
which someone has been injured. The table below describes the types of road user 
injured and the severity of these injuries in 2006.</p>

<p>There were far fewer reported injuries of cyclists and pedestrians than of 
drivers and passengers, making it difficult to compare injury severity for the 
four groups of road user. The <strong>proportions</strong> within each group of 
road users are easier to compare than the raw frequencies &mdash; <strong>click on 
any row</strong> to see how the proportions are obtained.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Propn within Road user group</strong> from the pop-up menu 
to display the resulting proportions. This scales each row, making all row totals 
the same, 1.0. Select <strong>Percent within Road user group</strong> to show 
these proportions as percentages &mdash; clearer since leading zeros are omitted.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Observe that a much higher 
proportion of pedestrians are killed or have serious injuries than other road 
users.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows bar charts for the four types of road users who were injured.</p>

<p>The large number of drivers and passengers who were injured or killed is evident 
in the bar chart, but it does not effectively allow comparison of the injury types 
of the four groups of road users.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Propn within Road user group</strong> or <strong>Percent within 
</strong><strong>Road user group</strong> from the pop-up menu. The diagram now 
shows more clearly the larger proportion of pedestrians who were killed or had 
serious injuries, and the low proportion of cyclists who were killed.</p>

<p class="heading">Interpretation</p>
		
<p>Attributing a <strong>reason</strong> to the greater severity of pedestrian 
injuries is difficult. Perhaps pedestrians are more likely to suffer serious inuries 
and death, but there could also be under-reporting of minor injuries by pedestrians.</p>
