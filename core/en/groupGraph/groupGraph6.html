<p class="heading">Three-dimensional bar charts</p>
<p>It is tempting to 'artistically enhance' bar charts to compare groups, especially 
if there are not many groups or categories. In particular, avoid using 3-dimensional 
versions of bar charts, even though they can be easily produced in spreadsheets 
such as Microsoft Excel.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>It is much harder to read information from 3-dimensional 
versions of bar charts.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In particular, avoid perspective views of such 3-dimensional representations 
in which parts of the diagram that are closer to the viewer are magnified &mdash; they 
are usually misleading.</p>

<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Educational level of children</p>

<p>The 3-dimensional bar chart below shows the numbers of students in primary, 
secondary and tertiary education in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam in 2002.</p>

<p>Drag the centre of the diagram to rotate it. (Press the mouse button and move 
the mouse with the button held down.) Although the diagram looks pretty, it is 
now hard to estimate the numbers in the categories. (For example, how many students 
are in tertiary education in the Philippines?)</p>
<p>Click the button <strong>Cluster by country</strong> then drag the slider to 
make the bars narrow enough that they do not overlap. This is equivalent to a 
clustered bar chart. Click <strong>Cluster by level</strong> to show the corresponding 
clustering of the bars by educational level.</p>
<p class="heading">Other examples</p>
<p>The following stacked bar chart was published to show the different types of 
energy used by different types of consumer in New Zealand in 1996.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/energyUseBars.gif" width="350" height="454"></p>
<p>The third dimension makes it harder to assess the size of the segments. How 
much Natural Gas is used by Transport? Is it more than the Natural Gas in Residential 
use?</p>
<p>Even worse, the diagram has been drawn with a perspective viewpoint so the 
'nearer' part of the diagram is larger than the part that is further from the 
viewer. As a result, the segments on the right appear somewhat larger than they 
actually are.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>The final example was published on a web site to compare the performance of different virtual machines running on four Macintosh computers.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/vmPerformance.gif" width="600" height="380"></p>
<p>It is almost impossible to compare performance on the different Macintosh computers.</p>
