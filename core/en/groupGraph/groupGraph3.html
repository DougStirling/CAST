<p class="heading">Clustering the bars</p>

<p>On the previous page, the diagram that was used to compare the groups was essentially 
a collection of separate bar charts that were all drawn to the same scale &mdash; either 
frequency or percentage.</p>
<p>When drawn in this way, the bars corresponding to any particular category of 
interest (e.g. 'killed' in the road injury exampe) are widely separated in the 
diagram, making comparisons harder. An alternative display uses the same bars, 
but clusters them by the categories, rather than by groups. This type of <strong>clustered 
bar chart</strong> makes it easier to spot subtle differences between the groups.</p>

<p class="heading">Where do nurses work?</p>

<p>Colleges that train nurses need to know the types of work that the nurses will 
eventually perform, in order to give them appropriate training. One aspect of 
this is the mix of work settings that will eventually employ these nurses.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the work settings of all enrolled nurses in Australia 
in 1993, 1996 and 1999.</p>

<p>Although the distribution of workplaces within each year is clearly shown when 
the bars are clustered by year, it is harder to assess any trends over the six-year 
period since the three bar charts all have a similar shape.</p>
<p>Select the option <strong>Workplace</strong> from the pop-up menu to cluster 
the bars by workplace. From this diagram it is easier to see the more subtle changes 
in distribution over the period.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When reading clustered bar charts of percentages, 
always think carefully about how the bars are clustered. Do they add to 100% in 
each cluster or over the same positions in different clusters?</p>

<p class="heading">Third world development</p>
<p>The two clustered bar charts below were both printed in a publication about 
global development.</p>

<br>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/mdgClusters.gif" width="595" height="359"></p>
<p>Although both diagrams relate to data about different groups of countries in 
different years, observe that the bars have been clustered differently. In practice, 
you should try both clusterings and pick the one that most clearly communicates 
the message that you intend to make.</p>
