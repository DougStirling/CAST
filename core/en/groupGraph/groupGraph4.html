<p class="heading">Stacking the bars</p>

<p>Although clustered bar charts are useful displays for comparing groups, they 
become very cluttered if there are many groups. When the values in each group 
form a partition of a meaningful total, an alternative display is a <strong>stacked 
bar chart</strong>. This simply stacks the bars from each group on top of each 
other in a column (or a row if the bars are oriented horizontally).</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Stacked bar charts are usually a clearer way to compare many groups.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Stacked bar charts are particularly useful if the categories are ordered in 
some meaningful way.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Only draw a stacked bar chart if the values in 
each group are a partition of a meaningful total for the group.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Stacked bar charts for proportions</p>
<p>If a stacked bar chart is drawn from the raw values in a table, the overall 
lengths of the stacks represent the group totals. If these group totals vary considerably, 
or if differences in the group totals are of little importance, the stacked bar 
chart can be drawn using the percentages within each group. This scales each stack 
to the same length (100%), making it easier to compare the distribution of categories 
within the groups.</p>

<p class="heading">Educational qualifications</p>

<p>The final-year qualification that is attempted by most secondary students in 
New Zealand (NCEA level 3) is split into a set of units called <strong>achievement 
standards</strong>, some of which are internally assessed, others being assessed 
in a national examination. For each unit, the result is either <em>Not achieved</em>, 
<em>Achieved</em>, <em>Merit</em> or <em>Excellence</em>. The achievement standards 
are classified into the following major subject areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Science and Technology</li>
<li>Social Sciences</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>The Arts, Health and Physical Education</li>
<li>Languages (including Maori)</li>
</ul>
<p>The results for 2006 are displayed for the externally assessed units in the 
bar chart and table below.</p>

<p>There were different numbers attempting achievement standards in the different 
subjects, so select <strong>Propn within Subject</strong> or <strong>Percent within 
Subject</strong> from the pop-up menu at the top.</p>
<p>Now click the checkbox <strong>Stacked</strong> to change the bar chart into 
a stacked bar chart. Since the responses are ordered (e.g. <em>Merit</em> is between 
<em>Achieved</em> and <em>Excellence</em>), the stacked bar charts are particularly 
effective for comparing the subjects. Observe in particular that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social Sciences and English had the biggest proportion who did not achieve 
their achievement standards</li>
<li>The biggest proportion achieving was for Languages and this also had a large 
proportion of <em>Merit</em> and <em>Excellence</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Two published stacked bar charts</p>
<p>The following stacked bar chart is based on raw counts of individuals. The 
total heights of the bars show the total number of immigrants in the two years, 
so the diagram highlights the increase in the total number from 1990 to 2000. 
However it is difficult to assess how the proportion of immigrants with tertiary 
education changed. A second stacked bar chart displaying the percentages in each 
year would have shown that better. </p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/immigrantEducation.gif" width="533" height="339"></p>
<p>The next stacked bar chart shows information about those with HIV in several 
regions of the world. It is intended to show whether there are differences between 
the ages or genders of those with the disease in the regions. The total numbers 
with HIV are of much less interest here, so the diagram displays percentages and 
all stacks therefore have length 100%.</p>
