<p class="heading">Colour and shades of grey</p>
  
<p>Simple bar charts (of the type shown in this section) display their information 
as effectively in black and white as in colour.</p>
<p>In pie charts however, the slices corresponding to the categories touch each 
other, so it is more important that they can be easily distinguished. If there 
are more than 3 or 4 different categories, colour is best to distinguish them. 
There is no overhead to use colour in web-based publications, but it is more expensive 
to print colour on paper so different shades of grey are often used in printed 
pie charts.</p>
<p>Shades of grey are difficult to distinguish if there are many of them, so the 
category names are often printed adjacent to the pie chart slices instead of in 
a separate key.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In publications that do not use colour, extra care 
must be taken to clearly identify the segments of pie charts.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Next billion population</p>
<p>The world population is projected to increase by just over 1 billion between 
2000 and 2015. The pie chart below describes the regions of the world from which 
these extra people will come.</p>

<p>It is fairly easy to match the slices of the pie chart to countries when they 
are drawn in colour. Use the pop-up menu to draw the pie chart with different 
shades of grey. The regions are now harder to identify.</p>
<p class="heading">Types of student in tertiary education</p>
<p>The pie charts below were published to describe the students in three types 
of tertiary education college in New Zealand in 2002. Note how the segments of 
the pie chart are labelled.</p>

<p>Although the individual pie charts are clear, there is a major problem with 
the way that they are shaded. There is no consistency in the ordering or shading 
of categories in the different pie charts. For example, 'full-time female' is 
represented by black in two of the pie charts but grey in the third. If the same 
ordering and shading had been used in all pie charts, it would have been much 
easier to understand the differences between the three types of college.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If several groups are being compared, it is <strong>essential</strong> 
that the same colours and ordering are used for the display of each.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Comparison of different groups will be discussed more fully in a later section.</p>
