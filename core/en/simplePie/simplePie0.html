<p><img src="images/overviewPie.gif" width="288" height="113" align="right">If 
the values in a simple table have a meaningful total and are therefore partitions 
of this total quantity, an alternative graphical display is a pie chart in which 
the area of each segment is proportional to its value.</p>
<p>The combined contribution of adjacent groups is easier to assess in a pie chart, 
but it is easier to compare individual groups in a bar chart, especially when 
there are many groups. Use the one that expresses the 'message' from the data 
most clearly. </p>
<p class="heading">Stacked bar chart</p>
<p><img src="images/overviewStacked.gif" width="138" height="113" align="right">A 
related display is a stacked bar chart that colours sections of a rectangle instead 
of a circle. A stacked bar chart is no better than a pie chart for a single set 
of data, but is a useful way to compare several sets (next section).</p>

versions of pie charts make the information harder to see and should be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> split the picture of a 3-dimensional object</p>
