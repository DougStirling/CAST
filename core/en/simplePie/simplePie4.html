<p class="heading">Pictographs</p>
  
<p>We mentioned earlier that the use of 2- and 3-dimensional pictures to replace 
the bars on a bar chart can be misleading since the visual impact of any bar depends 
on its area or volume, not its height. A similar problem arises when a picture 
is split into segments to form a kind of stacked bar chart. Again the visual impact 
of different slices is often different from their contribution to the total of 
the values.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Tourist accommodation</p>
<p>The diagram below was published to describe where tourists in New Zealand stayed 
during their trips.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/bed.gif" width="453" height="325"></p>


<p>This is similar to a stacked bar chart, but the pillow on the bed gives undue 
visual impact to the first category.</p>
<p class="heading">Petrol</p>
<p>The two diagrams below were published in a major New Zealand newspaper in 1997 
and are much more misleading.</p>
<div class="centred"><table class="centred">
<tr>
<td><img src="images/mobilOilRevenue.gif" width="250" height="528"></td>
<td width="20">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top"><img src="images/oilBarrel.gif" width="289" height="386"></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>The diagram on the left gives greater visual impact to the central categories, 
both of which are types of government taxation. It should come as no surprise 
that the diagram was provided to the newspaper by one of the petrol companies!</p>
<p>The diagram on the right is not so bad, but it has been inaccurately drawn 
and the perspective display makes the petrol companies at the top of the diagram 
seem too large. (The diameter of the barrel is greater at the top.)</p>
<p class="heading">Origin of tourists to New Zealand in 1996-97</p>

<p>In next diagram also uses splits a picture into segments, but at least some 
attempt has been made to keep the visual impact of each category proportional 
to its value.</p>
