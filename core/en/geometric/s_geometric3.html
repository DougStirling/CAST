<p>The probability below can be found by adding a few geometric probabilities.</p>

<div class="questionSoln">
<div class="question">
<p class="questionTitle">Question</p>
<p>If a fair six-sided die is rolled repeatedly, what is the probability that it will take between 6 and 8 rolls (inclusive) to get the first &quot;six&quot;?</p>

<p>Adding probabilities like this works provided there are not too many of them. However an alternative way to find probabilities is to use the cumulative distribution function.</p>

<div class="questionSoln">
<div class="question">
<p class="questionTitle">Question</p>
<p>If a fair six-sided die is rolled repeatedly, what is the probability that it will take between 10 and 20 rolls (inclusive) to get the first &quot;six&quot;?</p>
