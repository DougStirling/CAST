<p class="heading">Comparing  big and small models</p>

<p>We are interested in assessing whether the simpler &quot;small&quot; model fits the data or whether the more general &quot;big&quot; model is needed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\mathcal{M}_S\) is the correct model for the data.</li>
	<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>:  \(\mathcal{M}_S\) is not correct and \(\mathcal{M}_B\) must be used to model the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to remember that the big model, \(\mathcal{M}_B\), <strong>always</strong> fits better than the small model, \(\mathcal{M}_S\) â€” it is more general and has more parameters to adjust.</p>
<p>What we need to consider is whether \(\mathcal{M}_B\) fits <strong>significantly</strong> better.</p>
<p class="heading">Measuring how well a model fits the data</p>
<p>The fit of any model can be described by the maximum possible likelihood for that model,</p>
\[
L(\mathcal{M}) \;\;=\;\; \underset{\text{all models in }\mathcal{M}}{\operatorname{max}} P(data \mid model)
\]
<p>This is obtained by calculating the maximum likelihood estimates of all unknown parameters and inserting them into the likelihood function.</p>
<p class="heading">Likelihood ratio</p>
<p>The model \(\mathcal{M}_S\) is a special case of model \(\mathcal{M}_B\), so \(L(\mathcal{M}_B)\) can always be made at least as big as \(L(\mathcal{M}_S)\). The maximised likelihood is therefore at least as large for the large model as for the small model,</p>
\[
L(\mathcal{M}_B) \;\;\ge\;\; L(\mathcal{M}_S)
\]
<p>Equivalently, the <strong>likelihood ratio</strong> is always at least one,</p>
\[
R \;\;=\;\; \frac{L(\mathcal{M}_B)}{L(\mathcal{M}_S)} \;\;\ge\;\; 1
\]
<p>Big values of \(R\) suggest that \(\mathcal{M}_S\) does not fit as well as \(\mathcal{M}_B\).</p>
<p class="heading">Log of likelihood ratio</p>
<p>Equivalently, taking logs of this inequality,</p>
\[
\log(R) \;\;=\;\; \ell(\mathcal{M}_B) - \ell(\mathcal{M}_S) \;\;\ge\;\; 0
\]
<p>Again, big values suggest that \(\mathcal{M}_S\) does not fit as well as \(\mathcal{M}_B\).</p>
