<p class="heading">Signal and noise</p>

<p>Any graphical or tabular display of data should be designed to highlight 
	important features of the data. This useful information in the display is 
	called its <strong>signal</strong>. Other aspects of the display that do not 
	contain information that can be usefully interpreted are called the <strong>noise</strong> 
	in the display.</p>
<p>Edward Tufte, in an excellent book about data presentation (<em>The Visual 
	Display of Quantitative Information</em>, 1983), distinguished different kinds 
	of noise in displays.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Non-data noise</dt>
	<dd>This refers to unnecessary graphics and gridlines that are added to displays. 
		Tufte recommends minimising the amount of 'non-data ink' in any display.</dd>
	<dt>Data noise</dt>
	<dd>Data noise is information about the data that does not help the reader 
		to understand the 'signal' in the data. Many reports are full of data noise 
		&mdash; the writer has spent time collecting data and does not want to miss any 
		of it out, even if it is not relevant!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both kinds of noise make it harder to detect the signal in a display, so 
	noise should be avoided.</p>
<p class="heading">Significant digits</p>
<p>One type of data noise is very common, but easily removed. Many tables contain 
	values that are reported with more significant digits than necessary. Usually 
	the pattern of values in a table can be understood from only their first 2 
	or 3 digits &mdash; the remaining digits are data noise.</p>
<p>(If the complete data may be needed by others for further analysis, the full 
	data can be included in an appendix or made available on a web site, but not 
	in the body of a report.)</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Car colours in New Zealand">
	<p class="heading">Car colours in New Zealand</p>

	<p>The table below describes the colours of all cars registered in New Zealand 
		in 2013.</p>
		
<div class="centred">  
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="400" height="380">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="catProg.TableDecimalsApplet">
<param name="varName" value="Cars">
<param name="values" value="665405 474236 424050 374643 258035 249861 231706 86602 46253 24935 23642 17324 11932 6080">
<param name="labelName" value="Colour">
<param name="labels" value="Silver Blue White Red Green Black Grey Gold Brown Yellow Purple Orange Cream Pink">
<param name="propnDecimals" value="6">
</applet> 
</div>

	
	<p>Nobody reading the table would be interested in the final few digits of 
		the values. Use the '-' button under the frequencies to reduce the number 
		of significant digits displayed.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Showing the frequencies to the nearest thousand removes data 
				noise from the table but retains all useful information.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>In a similar way, round the proportions to 3 decimals &mdash; further digits 
		do not help you to understand the data.</p>
	<p>Finally click the <strong>Percentage</strong> checkbox to display percentages 
		instead of proportions. This simply multiplies the proportions by 100, but 
		it removes some of the leading zeros and therefore makes the values stand 
		out better</p>
	<p class="heading">Licensed vehicles in New Zealand</p>
	<p>The next table was also published on the Land Transport New Zealand web 
		site. It describes the types of vehicles licensed in June 2006 and the changes 
		during the previous two years.</p>
	

<p class="eqn"><img src="images/carTypesBad.png" width="536" height="535"/></p>
				
	<p>The last 2 or 3 digits of the counts are of little relevence to most policy 
		makers or other readers of the table. These values could be made available 
		in a separate appendix (or as a linked file in spreadsheet format), but 
		most users would get the same information more clearly if the vehicle counts 
		were given to the nearest thousand and the percentage changes were shown 
		with a single decimal digit.</p>
	<p>The table below also rearranges the columns to separate the columns of 
		vehicle counts from the columns of percentage change. This makes it easier 
		to compare related values.</p>

<p class="eqn"><img src="images/carTypesGood.png" width="536" height="356"/></p>
	
	<p>It could be argued that one decimal digit should be shown for the category <em>Taxis</em> since
the numbers are so small that they do not change  when rounded to thousands.
However the columns of percentage change adequately describe the differences
 between the years for these categories.</p>
