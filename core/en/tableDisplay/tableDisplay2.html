<p class="heading">Layout of columns</p>
<p>Think carefully about how to arrange the rows and columns.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Values that you are interested in comparing should be close 
		to each other.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Reordering the rows and columns should be considered. Judicious use of white 
space can help to separate different groups of values and therefore bring 
related values closer together.</p>
<p class="heading">Annotation</p>
<p>When a table is included in a report, the main information that can be gained 
from the table should also be summarised in the body of the report in words.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Do not simply repeat the values in the table. The annotation 
		should summarise and interpret.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">UN survey responses</p>


<p>The table below was published in a United Nations report describing the 
	results of a survey of countries about implementation of a set of 'Fundamental 
	Principles of Official Statistics' by their National Statistics Offices. 
	The table summarises which countries responded to the survey questionnaire.</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/unRespondentTable.gif" width="524" height="349"></td>
	</tr>
</table></div>
<p>This table contains:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Two</strong> frequency tables &mdash; separately categorising the 
		countries that were sent the questionnaire (recipients) and those returning 
		the completed questionnaire (respondents) by region.</li>
	<li><strong>Two</strong> tables that categorise recipients and respondents 
		by development category. (Their presentation is non-standard since the 
		least developed countries are included in both of the first two rows.)</li>
	<li>A column of response rates for each development category and region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the columns of frequencies are not adjacent and the columns of percentages are not adjacent, 
	comparisons are harder. A better format for the table groups together the 
	columns of related values and separates these groups with white space.</p>
<p>(We have also made improvements to the column headings and replaced the 
	first two rows of the table with the country categories <em>Least developed</em> 
	and <em>Other developing</em> to form a standard frequency table.)</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
	<tr> 
		<td><img src="images/unRespondentTable2.gif" width="507" height="220"></td>
	</tr>
</table></div>
<p class="heading">Textual summary</p>
<p>A description of the table in the report should point out the much higher 
	response rates in the developed countries, and particularly in Asia and 
	Europe.<span class="arial"></span> As a result, the 
	least developed countries (especially Oceania, the Americas and Africa) 
	are under-represented in the survey and in the remainder of the report.<br>
