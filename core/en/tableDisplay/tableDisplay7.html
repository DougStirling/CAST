<p>We end this section with a published table that can be improved using many 
    of the techniques described in the last few pages.</p>
  <div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Tourist arrivals in South Africa</p>

		<p>The following table was published as part of a report on tourism in South 
			Africa. It describes the origin of tourist arrivals in 2004 and the amounts 
			that they spent in South Africa (excluding capital expenditure).</p>

<p class="eqn"><img src="images/saTouristsBad.png" width="583" height="800" /></p>
		<p>This table can be improved in several ways:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Grid lines</dt>
			<dd>Every entry in the table is boxed. Removal of the lines brings the values 
				closer together and makes it easier to make comparisons.</dd>
			<dt>Significant digits</dt>
			<dd>Far too many significant digits are shown. The accuracy of the collected 
				data is unlikely to be as high as the reported values (especially for 
				the total expenditures) and it is hard to envisage any use of the data 
				that would require such accuracy. (The 'R' indicating the currency can 
				also be removed.)</dd>
			<dt>Reordering categories</dt>
			<dd>The countries in each region have been ordered alphabetically. Reordering 
				by either the number of arrivals or the total expenditure is better &mdash; 
				makes it easier to spot unusual values in other columns. (Reordering the 
				columns may also help.)</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>The table below presents the data more clearly. The eye is encouraged to 
			scan down columns looking for patterns and unusual values.</p>
