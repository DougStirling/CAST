<p class="heading notPrinted">Blocks</p>
<p>In practice, experiments must often be conducted with experimental units that
are quite variable.</p>
<p>The inaccuracy that results from varying experimental units in a completely
randomised experimental design can be reduced if the units can be grouped into
<strong>blocks of similar units</strong>.</p>
<p>This may be done based on measurements from the units before the experiment
is conducted, or may be based on their location or other known characteristics.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted on a dairy farm owned by Massey University in
New Zealand to assess three different pasture management strategies (early, late
and very late severe grazing).</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/masseyPaddocks.gif" width="550" height="427" class="summaryPict"></p>


<p>For operational reasons, it was decided to use paddocks numbered 6, 9, 11,
16 and 17 in the experiment and each paddock was divided into three parts (the
experimental units) &mdash; the minimum size to apply a different management strategy.</p>
<p>It
is fairly obvious that the five paddocks are not identical; creeks affect some
and they probably have different histories of fertiliser use. However the three
experimental units in each paddock are likely to be relatively similar to each
other, so we can consider each paddock to be a block of three experimental units.</p>
