<p class="heading notPrinted">Aim of similar experimental units</p>
<p>In experiments, we usually try to use experimental units that are as similar
as possible. Variability between experimental units increases the variability
in resulting response measurements and this 'noise' in the data makes it harder
to detect the effect of the experimental treatments.</p>
<p>In the simulation below, the units (animals) have varying initial weights,
so the estimated effect of a new diet is varies considerably between repeats
of the experiment.</p>

<p>In contrast, if the experimental units are similar, the effect of the new
diet can be estimated much more accurately.</p>
