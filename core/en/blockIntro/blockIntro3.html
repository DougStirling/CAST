<p class="heading">Ensuring that results hold more generally</p>

  <p>Even for experiments in which it is possible to use very similar experimental 
		units, it is not always desireable to do so. If all experimental units are 
		identical, it is difficult to generalise the results to <strong>other kinds 
		of experimental units</strong>.</p>
	<p>Using a variety of different experimental units (but grouped into blocks) allows 
		results to be generalised more easily &mdash; we can be more confident that the 
		results will hold for a variety of different types of experimental unit.</p>
	<p class="heading">Blocks for accuracy <span class="red">and</span> generality</p>
	<p>In a completely randomised experiment, intentional variation in the experimental units would result in less accurate estimates for the factors of interest. However  grouping these experimental units into blocks can result in estimates that have similar accuracy to those that would arise from homogeneous experimental units.</p>

<p class="heading">On-station and on-farm experiments</p>
<p>Crop trials are often initially conducted at research stations where the different varieties can be grown under well controlled conditions. However the results that are (accurately) determined from an experiment in a single research station may not hold in the same way on real farms in which there are a multitude of different farm types and farmer practices. For example, the most productive variety of maize in the research station may not perform well in particular soils or with particular cultivation practices that are used by some farmers.</p>
<p>Before  recommendations are made about the best varieties, <strong>on-farm</strong> experiments are often conducted involving this extra variation. In these experiments, a few plots of land or animals are used in each of several farms. The experimental units in each farm would be considered to be a separate <strong>block</strong>.</p>

 		<p class="heading">Penicillin production</p>

		<p>In the example below, a process for manufacture of penicillin was being 
			investigated. Four variants of the basic process (A, B, C and D) were being 
		studied and the response measurement was the yield of penicillin.</p>
		<p>An important raw material for the process was corn steep liquor, and this 
			was quite variable. Instead of conducting the experiment with only one blend 
			of corn steep liquor, it was therefore decided to use five different blends 
			(blocks) in order to ensure that the results were not specific to one particular 
			blend. Four different runs of the experiment were used with each blend, 
		with the four process variants randomly allocated to the runs. The resulting yields are shown in the diagram below.</p>
