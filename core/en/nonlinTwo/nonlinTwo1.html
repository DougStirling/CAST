<p class="heading">Linear and nonlinear models</p>
  <p>If there is nonlinearity in the relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>x</em>, 
		so that the normal linear model with a single explanatory variable,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/simpleLinModel.gif" width="361" height="21"></p>
	<p>does not fit, we might try a model with a transformed explanatory variable 
		or response, such as</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/logModel.gif" width="399" height="21"></p>
	<p>In terms of the response variable <span class="black"><em>y</em>*&nbsp;=&nbsp;log(<em>y</em>)</span>, 
		this is still a 'linear model' &mdash; it describes a linear relationship between 
		<span class="black"><em>y</em>*</span> and <span class="em black">x</span> . 
		The parameters can be estimated and tested in the same way.</p>
	<p>The important characteristic of a simple linear model is <strong>not</strong> 
		that it is linear in the original explanatory variables, but that:</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A simple linear model is <strong>linear 
				in the parameters</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

	  
	<p class="heading">Quadratic models</p>
  <p>An alternative way to model curvature in the relationship between <em>Y</em> 
		and <em>x</em> is to add a quadratic term to the model,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/quadModel.gif" width="419" height="23"></p>
	<p>Although this initially seems to be a different type of model from ordinary 
		linear regression models, it can also be written as a linear model with <strong>two</strong> 
		explanatory variables,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/quadModel2.gif" width="285" height="37"></p>
	<p>The model is therefore linear if we treat <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> as a second 
		'explanatory variable'.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The quadratic model is a general linear model because it is 
				<strong>linear in the parameters</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The only difference from ordinary linear models with two explanatory variables 
		is that the two explanatory variables are related quadratically. However since 
		we treat the explanatory variables as constants, this does not affect how 
		the model is fitted or used.</p>
