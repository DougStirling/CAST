<p class="heading">Observational studies and experiments</p>
<p>The method of data collection has a major influence on whether a relationship 
can be interpreted as causal.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In observational studies, there is usually the potential for a lurking 
variable to underlie any observed relationship, so it is difficult to interpret 
relationships.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The most important characteristic of experiments is that they often do allow 
relationships to be interpreted as causal ones.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In a well designed experiment, there is little chance of lurking variables 
driving the observed relationships, so any relationship will be causal.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>In a <strong>badly</strong> designed experiment however, lurking variables 
    can still cause difficulties in interpreting relationships.</p>
<p>The examples below illustrate differences in interpreting observational and 
experimental data.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Irrigation and wheat growth">
<p class="heading">Irrigation and wheat growth: an observational study</p>
<p>A farm manager is interested in how soil moisture level affects the yield of 
wheat? Irrigation is expensive to install and operate, so what are the likely 
benefits? In a sample of farms, a consultant installs rain gauges; rainfall (which 
includes irrigation from sprinklers) and crop yield are subsequently measured.</p>

<div class="centred"> 
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="350" height="320">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="designProg.PictureSwapApplet">
<param name="picture1" value="design/obsWheatCross">
<param name="picture2" value="design/obsWheatPict">
<param name="pictureCheck" value="Show Temperature"> 
</applet>
</div>

<p>The scatterplot does not suggest that farms with higher rainfall or irrigation 
tend to have greater yields of wheat. However the data are observational and may 
not therefore show causal relationships.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The researcher should not conclude that irrigation has no effect on 
wheat yields</p>
</div></div>

<p>The study was conducted over a large region in which the climate varied, so 
other characteristics of the sampled farms may also affect wheat yield. In particular, 
the mean summer temperature is a lurking variable that may affect the relationship 
&mdash; wetter farms also tend to be colder and the lower temperature may counter any 
benefits from higher rainfall. </p>
<p>Click the checkbox <strong>Show Temperature</strong> to discover which farms 
are hottest and coldest. Temperature is indeed a lurking variable here &mdash; there 
is a positive relationship between wheat yield and rainfall <strong>within each 
temperature group</strong>. If information about temperature was not available, 
the wrong conclusion about the likely effect of irrigation would be reached.</p>
<p class="heading">Irrigation and wheat growth: an experiment</p>
<p>In an experimental study, the researcher <strong>controls moisture</strong> 
in each farm using supplementary irrigation. </p>
<p>In the experiment whose results are displayed below, farms from wetter areas 
are not used (since it is not possible to use irrigation to reduce moisture, only 
to increase it). In each of 8 farms, 3 fields were used in the study, so that 
the fields in each group of 3 are as similar as possible. Irrigation is used to 
control moisture in each field, so that the three fields in each farm get the 
equivalent of 2, 2.5 and 3 mm of rainfall per day over the growing season. </p>
<p>Since differences between temperature, sunshine, and other variables that may 
affect wheat yields are no longer related to moisture, any differences between 
yields can be causally attributed to moisture. </p>
<p>The jittered dot plot below shows the results of the experiment. </p>

<div class="centred"> 
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="350" height="320">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="designProg.PictureSwapApplet">
<param name="picture1" value="design/expWheatCross">
<param name="picture2" value="design/expWheatPict">
<param name="pictureCheck" value="Show Temperature"> 
</applet>
</div>

<p>Since there are similar proportions of warm farms in all three groups, a similar 
picture of the effect of moisture is obtained whether or not we take account of 
temperature. From the results shown above, we would conclude that increasing moisture 
by 1 mm per day would increase wheat yields by approximately 0.4 tonnes per hectare.
