<p class="heading notPrinted">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>We are often interested in relationships between variables. The correlation between two numerical variables summarises their relationship; a contingency table  contains information about the relationship between two categorical variables.</p>
<p>When the individuals can be split into groups, a categorical variable can
be used to define group membership. Differences between the groups can then be
expressed as a relationship between the grouping variable and other variables.
The following questions are essentially asking the same in two different ways:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Do boys and girls aged 14 perform the same at maths?</dt>
	<dt>Is there a relationship between gender and mark in a maths test?</dt>
</dl>
<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
	evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>
