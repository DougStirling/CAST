<p class="heading notPrinted">Is a relationship causal?</p>
	<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
		the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
		adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change.</p>
	<p>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
	collected. <strong>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</strong></p>
	<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
	<p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables called <strong>lurking variables</strong> that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
  it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>
