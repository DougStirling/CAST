<p class="heading notPrinted">Observational studies and experiments</p>
	<p>The method of data collection has a major influence on whether a relationship 
		can be interpreted as causal.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Observational study</dt>
		<dd>There is usually the potential for a lurking 
				variable to underlie any observed relationship, so it is difficult to interpret 
		relationships.</dd>
		<dt>Experiment</dt>
		<dd>Provided the experiment has been designed well, there is little chance of lurking variables 
		driving the observed relationships, so any relationship will be causal.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>In a <strong>badly</strong> designed experiment however, lurking variables 
		can still cause difficulties in interpreting relationships.</p>
