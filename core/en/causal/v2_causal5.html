<p class="heading">Observational studies and experiments</p>
<p>The method of data collection has a major influence on whether a relationship 
can be interpreted as causal.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In observational studies, there is usually the potential for a lurking 
variable to underlie any observed relationship, making it difficult
to interpret.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The most important characteristic of experiments is that they often do allow 
relationships to be interpreted as causal ones.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In a well designed experiment, there is little chance of lurking variables 
driving the observed relationships, so any relationship will be causal.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>In a <strong>badly</strong> designed experiment however, lurking variables 
    can still cause difficulties in interpreting relationships.</p>
