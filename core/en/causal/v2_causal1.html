<p class="heading">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>In most data sets, we are interested in the relationships between the variables.</p>
<p>For bivariate numerical data, correlation and least squares give information about the relationship. A contingency table and conditional proportions summarise the relationship between two categorical variables. If a numerical variable is recorded from individuals in two or more groups, differences  between the groups can also be expressed as relationships between the variable and a categorical variable describing the grouping.</p>

<p class="heading">Interpreting relationships</p>
<p>Relationships can be much harder to interpret than you might think. In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>
