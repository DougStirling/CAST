<p class="heading">Relationship between variables</p>
<p>In most data sets, we are interested in the relationship between the variables. 
This is most obviously the case when the data consist of two numerical variables 
(correlation and least squares give information about the relationship) or two 
categorical variables (a contingency table and conditional proportions help show 
the relationship).</p>
<p class="heading">Groups and relationships</p>
<p>Questions about differences between two or more groups can <strong>also</strong> 
be expressed in terms of relationships between variables if group membership is 
represented by a categorical variable. For example, if we have collected data 
about incomes from a sample of males and a sample of females, we would be interested 
in comparing these two groups &mdash; i.e. the relationship between income and gender.</p>

<p>In some situations, the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship 
evident in a scatterplot, may not describe a meaningful 'real' relationship.</p>
