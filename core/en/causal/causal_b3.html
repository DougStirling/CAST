<p class="heading">Is a relationship causal?</p>
<p>Investigators usually hope to find <strong>causal relationships</strong> between 
the variables that are recorded. If one variable causally affects the other, then 
adjusting the value of that variable will cause the other to change. For example, 
if the milk yield of cows is causally affected by a dietary supplement, then yields 
can be increased by changing this supplement. </p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Causality can only be determined by reasoning about how the data were 
collected.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The data values themselves contain no information that can help you to decide.</p>
<p class="heading">Lurking variables</p>
  <p>Non-causal relationships between two variables usually result from the effect 
    of further variables called <strong>lurking variables</strong> that are related to the variables under investigation. 
    Causal relationships can only be deduced if 
  it can be reasoned that lurking variables are not present.</p>

<p class="heading">Cabbage pests and diseases</p>
<p>A plant researcher is investigating the relationship between different diseases 
and pests of vegetable plants. The following data come from a sample of 112 vegetable 
gardens in which cabbages were grown organically. The contingency table shows 
the gardens that were classified as being infested with cabbage caterpillars and 
club root (a disease that leads to swollen roots). </p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/cabbageDisease.gif" width="333" height="115"> 
</p>
<p>A larger proportion of gardens that are clear of club root are also clear of 
cabbage caterpillars. Similarly, a larger proportion of gardens that are not infested 
by cabbage caterpillars are also free from club root. </p>
<p>There are three possible interpretations of this relationship between cabbage 
caterpillars and club root. </p>
<ul>
<li>Club root directly affects cabbage caterpillars. <span class="black">Perhaps the butterflies are attracted to lay eggs on diseased plants.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Cabbage caterpillars directly affect club root. <span class="black">Perhaps infestation by cabbage caterpillars weakens the plants and makes them more susceptible to disease.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>
      <li>Lurking variables affect both cabbage caterpillar infestation and club root. 
        <span class="black">For example, the different vegetable gardens will be in areas with different soils and different micro-climates. It is possible that some gardens grow weaker plants that are therefore more susceptible to both infestations. Changing one variable would not affect the other.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The data cannot help to resolve the issue of causation so it would be incorrect 
to report any causal relationship from these data.</p>
