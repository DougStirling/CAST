<p class="heading">Association</p>
  <p>As noted in the previous page, researchers are usually interested in <strong>relationships</strong> 
    between variables. When two variables are related, we say that there is <strong>association</strong> 
    between them.</p>
<p>For example, consider the height, <em>X</em>, and weight, <em>Y</em>, of a 
sample of school children. Tall children tend to be heavier, so high values of 
<em>X</em> are associated with high values of <em>Y</em>. The correlation coefficient 
describes the amount of linear association between two such numerical variables.</p>
<p class="heading">Causal relationships</p>
<p>In some data sets, it is possible to conclude that one variable has a direct 
influence on the other. This is called a <strong>causal relationship</strong>.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/reln1.gif" width="297" height="65"></p>
<p>For example, ...</p>
<ul>
<li>A scientist in a dairy factory tries four different packaging materials for 
blocks of cheese and measures their shelf life. The packaging material might influence 
shelf life, but the shelf life cannot influence the packaging material used. The 
relationship is therefore causal.</li>
<li>A bank manager is concerned with the number of customers whose accounts are 
overdrawn. Half of the accounts that become overdrawn in one week are randomly 
selected and the manager telephones the customer to offer advice. Any difference 
between the mean account balances after two months of the overdrawn accounts that 
did and did not receive advice can be causally attributed to the phone calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>If two variables are causally related, it is possible to conclude that changes 
to the explanatory variable, <em>X</em>, will have a direct impact on <em>Y</em>.</p>
<p class="heading">Non-causal relationships</p>
  <p>Not all relationships are causal. In non-causal relationships, the relationship 
    that is evident between the two variables is not completely the result of 
    one variable directly affecting the other. In the most extreme case, ...</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Two variables can be related to each other 
            without either variable directly affecting the values of the other.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>The two diagrams below illustrate mechanisms that result in non-causal relationships 
    between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>.</p>
  <div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td><img class="gif" src="images/reln2.gif" width="297" height="154"></td>
<td><img class="gif" src="images/reln3.gif" width="297" height="120"></td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>If two variables are <strong>not</strong> causally related, it is impossible 
to tell whether changes to one variable, <em>X</em>, will result in changes to 
the other variable, <em>Y</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the scatterplot below shows data from a sample of towns in a region.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="images/cancerChurch.gif" width="325" height="272"></p>
<p>The positive correlation between the number of churches and the number of deaths 
from cancer is an example of a non-causal relationship &mdash; the size of the towns 
is a lurking variable since larger towns have more churches and also more deaths. 
Clearly decreasing the number of churches in a town will not reduce the number 
of deaths from cancer!</p>
