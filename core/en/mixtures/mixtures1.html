<p class="heading">Independently adjustable factors</p>  
  <p>The experiments that were considered in earlier sections all involved factors 
		that could be independently controlled &mdash; any combination of factor values 
		within the experimental region of interest was possible. For example, in an 
		experiment to assess the effects of temperature and addition of an enzyme 
		to the strength of a plastic, these two factors can be independently adjusted 
		to give a run of the experiment at any desired combination of factor levels.</p>
  <p class="heading">Mixtures</p>
  <p>In contrast, some experiments are conducted to compare different mixtures 
		of ingredients in a product. If there are <em>k</em> ingredients whose proportions 
		in the mixture are denoted by <em>x</em>, <em>z</em>,&nbsp;..., then the proportions 
		are constrained to sum to exactly 1.0 (i.e. 100% of the product) so they cannot 
		be independently adjusted.</p>

		<p>As an extreme example, if there is 100% of ingredient A in a run of the 
			experiment, then the only allowable proportion for the other ingredients 
			is zero.</p>
		<dt>Mixtures in which one ingredient dominates</dt>
		<dd>If one ingredient contributes nearly 100% of the mixture (e.g. when a 
			product consists of one base ingredient with small amounts of (<em>k</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) 
			additives), then it may be possible to independently adjust the proportions 
			of the (<em>k</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) additives within the range of interest 
			and a standard factorial (or fractional factorial) experimental design is 
			possible for these (<em>k</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) factors.</dd>
		<dt>Other mixtures</dt>
		<dd>If several ingredients can be moderately large, a standard design for 
			(<em>k</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) of the proportions as factors is not possible. 
			Increasing the proportion of any ingredient reduces the range of allowable 
			proportions for the others. The remainder of this section develops designs 
			for this type of experiment.</dd>

  <p class="heading">Experimental designs for mixtures</p>
  <p>When designing experiments for mixtures, we usually treat all <em>k</em> 
		proportions symmetrically. For <em>k</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 ingredients whose 
		proportions are <em>x</em>, <em>z</em> and <em>u</em>, the experimental region 
		consists of values such that</p>
  <p class=eqn>0 ≤ <em>x</em> ≤ 1</p>
  <p class=eqn>0 ≤ <em>z</em> ≤ 1</p>
  <p class=eqn>0 ≤ <em>u</em> ≤ 1</p>
  <p class=eqn><em>x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>u</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</p>
  <p>These constraints define an equilateral triangle in 3 dimensions, and the 
    experimental design should choose design points within this triangle.</p>

    <p class="heading">Mixtures of three fruit juices</p>
    <p>Consider an experiment to compare the perceived sweetness of a drink that 
      consists of a mixture of apple, orange and pineapple juices. The factors 
      that can be controlled in the experiment are the proportions of these three 
      juices. </p>
