<p class="heading">Separate experiments to assess the effects of two factors</p>
<p>Sometimes the response of interest is influenced by two or more factors, each 
of which can be controlled in an experiment.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'designTwo', 'twoFactors', '540', '308');</script>

<p>The simplest way to study two factors is with two separate completely randomised 
experiments. In each of these experiments, one factor is kept constant (e.g. the 
colour of an artificial flower) and the other factor is varied (e.g. the flower's 
shape). However this is an inefficient way to assess the effect of the two factors.</p>
<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'designTwo', 'secondFactor', '340', '254');</script>



		<p>A complete factorial experiment therefore estimates the effects of two 
			factors as accurately as two completely randomised experiments involving 
			double the total number of experimental units.</p>
