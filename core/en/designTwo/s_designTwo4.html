<p class="heading">Interaction</p>
	<p>If the effect of changing one factor is different for different levels of the other factor, there is said to be an <strong>interaction</strong> between the effects of the two factors.</p>

	<p>An important reason for using a factorial experimental design is that it allows you to detect interaction.</p>
	<p>Summarising the results of experiments is usually easier if there is no interaction between the factors. However if interaction exists, it is important that it is discovered and described.</p>
