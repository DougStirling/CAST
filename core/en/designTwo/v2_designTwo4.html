<p class="heading">Interaction</p>
<p>One important reason for using a factorial experimental design is to obtain
more accurate parameter estimates, but equally important is to detect <strong>interaction</strong> between
the effects of the factors. This arises when  the effect of changing the level
of one factor may be different for different levels of the second factor.</p>

<p>A factorial experiment is needed to look for 
			interaction.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The results of experiments are easier to summarise if there is no interaction
between the factors. However if interaction exists, it is important that it is
discovered and described.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'designTwo', 'texture', '562', '406');</script>

	<p>Because of the interaction between temperature and storage time,  we must separately provide the mean decreases at both 10°C and  20°C to fully describe how storage time affects texture.</p>
