<p class="heading">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
<p>An experiment is usually conducted in order to determine how some response 
is affected by one or more types of potential influences.</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
one or more explanatory variables.</p>
</div></div>


<p>For example, a researcher may wish to determine...</p>

<ul>
<li>How much does a follow-up phone call improve the response rate for a mailed 
survey?</li>
<li>Do Christmas bonus payments improve staff morale?</li>
<li>Which of four varieties of apple are preferred by supermarket customers?</li>
<li>How much will weekly sales be increased if the supermarkets in a chain are 
closed later than the usual 8pm?</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
Depending on the type of experiment, these units may be...</p>

<ul>
<li>people</li>
<li>bank accounts</li>
<li>shops in a retail chain</li>
<li>boxes of breakfast cereal</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>In the experiments that we will examine here,...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit &mdash; perhaps a numerical 
characteristic such as the price of television or a categorical characteristic 
such as its colour. </p>
<p>These controlled characteristics are explanatory variables and are called <strong>factors</strong> 
in the context of an experiment. The different values of the controlled characteristics 
are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Each experimental unit receives some treatment.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The decision about which of the different treatments is applied to 
each experimental unit is called the <strong>experimental 
design</strong>.</p>
</div></div>
