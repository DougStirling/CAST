<p class="heading">Causes of variation</p>
<p>In a completely randomised experiment, there are two potential reasons why the response in an experiment varies between 
experimental units.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Treatments</dt>
<dd>The experiment is usually conducted specifically to determine how the treatments 
affect the response.</dd>
<dt>Random variation</dt>
<dd>This is a catch-all that refers to all variation in the response that cannot 
be explained in terms of the treatment. It can involve measurement errors and 
differences between the experimental units. </dd>
</dl>
<p>In a completely randomised experiment, <strong>all variation is caused by the 
treatments or is considered as random variation</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Distinguishing the treatment effect and random variation</p>
<p>Experiments are conducted to determine the effect of different treatments. 
It is therefore essential that we can distinguish the treatment effects from random 
variation.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>There must be enough data to <strong>estimate random variation</strong> separately from variation caused by the treatments. </p>
</div></div>
<p>The easiest way to do this is with repeat measurements for each treatment &mdash; 
<strong>replication</strong>. Differences between these <strong>replicates</strong> 
are not due to treatment effects so they contain information about the amount 
of random variation.</p>
<p>Using knowledge about the amount of random variation in the experiment, we 
can better assess whether or not observed differences between the treatments are 
more than can be attributed to chance.</p>

<p class=heading>Crop experiment in a field</p>

<p>Researchers want to discover whether two varieties of wheat (A and B) have 
the same yield. One field is available for the experiment and it is know from previous experiments that the fertility and drainage of the soil is uniform over the whole field. The initial design 
for the experiment is shown below &mdash; the varieties were randomly allocated to 
either the left or right side of the field.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../designIntro/images/fieldNoRep.gif" width="307" height="156"></p>

<p>Since there was no replication, we cannot conclude that the observed difference 
in yields was due to the effects of the treatments.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>Replication would mean growing each variety in two or more different areas. 
The simplest modification to the above experiment involves growing the wheat in 
the same way, but recording yields from smaller areas of the field.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="../designIntro/images/fieldRep1.gif" width="307" height="156">
</p>

<p>Since we can now assess the random plot-to-plot variation, we can also assess 
whether the difference in yields can be attributed to the varieties of wheat.</p>
</div>

<p class=heading>Randomisation of replicates</p>

<p>In the above example, we assumed that the fertility of the soil was uniform over the whole field. In practice, this assumption can rarely be made. A natural fertility gradient across the field (left to right) would confound the variety used with fertility, making it impossible to tell whether   higher yields for variety B would be caused by the variety or better soil in the plots on the right.</p>
<p>The risk of confounding variety and fertility makes the above experimental design bad.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>Allocation of varieties to plots should be randomised to avoid the risk of fertility gradients biasing the results. </p>
</div></div>
