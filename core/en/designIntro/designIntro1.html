<p class="heading">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
<p>An experiment is usually conducted in order to determine how some response 
is affected by one or more types of potential influences.</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
one or more explanatory variables.</p>
</div></div>


<p>For example, a researcher may wish to determine...</p>

<ul>
<li>How is the surface finish of a component that is manufactured in a lathe affected 
by the rotation speed of the lathe?</li>
<li>Does aspirin lower blood pressure after an operation?</li>
<li>Which of four varieties of sweet corn have highest yields?</li>
<li>How much will weekly sales be increased if the supermarkets in a chain are 
closed later than the usual 8pm?</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
Depending on the type of experiment, these units may be...</p>

<ul>
<li>people</li>
<li>animals</li>
<li>trees</li>
<li>areas in a field</li>
<li>shops in a retail chain</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>In the experiments that we will examine here,...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit &mdash; perhaps a numerical 
characteristic such as the temperature at which a chemical reaction is conducted 
or a categorical characteristic such as the variety of wheat that is planted. 
</p>
<p>These controlled characteristics are the explanatory variables and are called 
<strong>factors</strong> in the context of an experiment. The different values 
of the controlled characteristics are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Each experimental unit receives some treatment.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The decision about which of the different treatments is applied to 
each experimental unit is called the <strong>experimental 
design</strong>.</p>
</div></div>
