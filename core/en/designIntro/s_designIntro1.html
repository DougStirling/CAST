<p class="heading notPrinted">Reason for conducting an experiment</p>
	<p>An experiment looks for a causal relationship between a response and 
	one or more explanatory variables.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
	<p>Experiments are generally conducted on a set of <strong>experimental units</strong>. 
		Depending on the type of experiment, these units could be people, animals, trees, areas in a field, shops in a retail chain, ...</p>
	<p>In the experiments that we will examine here, a single response measurement is made from each experimental unit.</p>
	<p class="heading">Factors and treatments</p>
	<p>The researcher has control over some aspect of each unit. These controlled characteristics are  explanatory variables and are called <strong>factors</strong> in the context of an experiment. The different values 
		of the controlled characteristics are called experimental <strong>treatments</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Experimental design</p>
	<p>The decision about which  treatment is applied to 
				each experimental unit is called the <strong>experimental 
	design</strong>.</p>
