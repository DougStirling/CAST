<p class="heading">Avoiding lurking variables</p>
<p>The varying characteristics of the experimental units can only be lurking
variables  if they are associated with the allocation of treatments to the experimental
units. A <strong>completely randomised design</strong> for the experiment minimises
the possible association with lurking variables.</p>

<p class="heading">Mechanics of randomisation</p>
<p>There are several different ways to randomise allocation of treatments to the experimental units. These all use random numbers either from printed tables or, preferably, generated by a computer. The simplest method is to use a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p class="heading">Other ways to randomise treatments (optional)</p>
<p>Although the above method of randomly allocating treatments to the experimental units using a spreadsheet is recommended,  two alternative methods are now described. The first illustrates the randomisation better, whereas the second provides an interesting application of probability.</p>


<div class="diagram">
	<p class=heading>Randomisation of drug treatment to 48 patients</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/biometric', 'designIntro', 'b_allocateDrug', '558', '382');</script>


<p>This method can be rather slow since many random indices are rejected towards the end of the method because treatments have already been allocated to these experimental units.</p>

	<p class=heading>Randomisation of drug treatment to 30 patients</p>

<p>The final randomisation method works through all experimental units in 
	order, picking a random treatment for each unit in turn. The only complication 
	is that the probabilities used to generate the treatments must be adjusted after 
	each unit gets a treatment. For example, if the first unit gets treatment 
	A, then the probability of the second unit getting treatment A must be reduced 
	a little. (If the same probabilities were used for each successive unit, then 
	too many treatment A's might be allocated.)</p>
