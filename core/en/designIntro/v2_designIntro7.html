<p class="heading">Known differences between  units</p>
<p>When some differences between the experimental units are understood before
the experiment is conducted, it is possible to do better than a completely randomised
design.</p>

<p class="heading">Simple block design</p>
<p>If possible, researchers usually try to define blocks that have equal size
and use each treatment the same number of times within each block. If the experimental
units within one block tend to have a higher mean response, all treatments are
affected equally.</p>
<p>As a result, our assessment of differences between the treatments
is not affected by differences between the blocks so the treatment effects are
more accurately estimated.</p>

<p>We now look at an example in which data from a randomised block design have been collected.</p>

<p class="heading">Comparison of completely randomised and randomised block designs</p>
<p>If we know anything about differences between the experimental units before the experiment is conducted, it is always worthwhile to group them into blocks  and conduct a randomised block design &mdash; the effects of the treatments 
will be estimated more accurately.</p>
<p>The benefits are greatest when there are large differences between the mean response in different blocks &mdash; if all blocks are essentially the same, there is nothing to be gained from using 
a randomised block design.</p>
