<p class="heading">Bad and good experimental design</p>

<p>The conclusions that can be drawn from an experiment depend on how it was
designed. In a badly designed experiment, it is often impossible to tell how
the treatment affects the response.</p>

<p class="heading">Speed of checkout operators &mdash; a badly designed experiment</p>

<p>This diagram illustrates how the effect of a factor can be incorrectly estimated

<p>Good experimental design  avoids major differences
between the two groups of experimental units, and some strategies  are described
in later pages of this section.</p>
