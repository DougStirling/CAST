<p class="heading notPrinted">Differences between experimental units</p>
	<p>In practice, it is usually impossible to conduct experiments with experimental units that are identical. The experimental units usually  have 
  characteristics that vary from unit to unit.</p>
	<p>These differences between the experimental units result in variability in the response measurements that are made from them, even if all receive the same treatment.</p>
