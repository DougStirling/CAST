<p class="heading">Causes of variation</p>
	<p>In a completely randomised experiment,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some variation in the response measurements is caused by <strong>differences between the treatments</strong>. The experiment is conducted to discover the effect of the treatments.</li>
		<li><strong>Random variation</strong> is a catch-all that refers to all variation  that cannot 
		be explained in terms of the treatments.</li>
	</ul>
<p class="heading">Distinguishing the treatment effect and random variation</p>
	<p>To find the effect of the treatments on the response, it is essentionl that we can distinguish it from random 
	variation.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>There must be enough data to <strong>estimate random variation</strong> separately from variation caused by the treatments. </p>
	</div></div>
	<p><strong>Replication</strong> involves repeat measurements for each treatment. The variation <strong>within</strong> each treatment is all random variation.</p>
	<p>Understanding the amount of random variation is necessary before you can interpret the effect of the treatments.</p>
