<p class="heading">Confounding</p>
  <p>In a badly designed experiment, the characteristics of the experimental units can distort the apparent relationship between the controlled variable and response.</p>
  <p>In the most extreme case, the design makes it <strong>impossible</strong> to
 disentangle the effects of the treatment and other characteristics of the experimental
units. If the treatment is perfectly correlated with another  variable, the effects
of the two variables <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished. 
  The treatment and variable are then said to be <strong>confounded</strong>.</p>
  <p>It is particularly important that confounding is avoided when data are collected.</p>

<p class="heading">Experiment with a new variety of wheat</p>
<p>An agricultural researcher wants to compare the yield of a new variety of wheat 
with the standard variety. Information about the yields from the standard variety 
are available from 10 experimental plots that grew this variety in 2013. The new 
variety is grown in the same plots in 2014 and the yields are recorded.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../designIntro/images/confounded3.gif" width="351" height="126"></p>
<p>Although its mean yield is higher, it should <strong>not</strong> be concluded 
that the new variety is better. Because the two varieties are planted different 
years, they will be grown with different rainfall and sunshine &mdash; variety is confounded 
with year (and hence its weather).</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../designIntro/images/confounded4.gif" width="351" height="126"></p>
<p>Perhaps the yield for the new variety is higher because the temperature and 
rainfall were higher in 2014.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>The experiment was a waste of time and money &mdash; no conclusions can 
    be reached about the new variety. </p>

<p class="heading">Trial of a new teaching method</p>
<p>An electronics lecturer writes a web-based tutorial resource to help teach 
digital logic. Students in a large class are told about the resource and allowed 
access through a login system that records usage. About half of the class use 
the tutorial.</p>
<p>To assess whether the tutorial helps students to learn the ideas of digital
 logic, the lecturer counts the number of correct answers from the 3 questions
 about digital logic in the final multiple-choice exam.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../designIntro/images/confounded1.gif" width="370" height="192"></p>
<p>Students who used the resource got a higher average mark, but it is impossible 
to conclude that it was the tutorial resource that caused it.</p>
<p>Use of the resource is confounded with other characteristics of the students 
&mdash; only the more motivated students use it and they also study harder. It is impossible 
to distinguish between motivated students performing better and use of the resource 
improving marks.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../designIntro/images/confounded2.gif" width="370" height="192"></p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>The data do not allow you to reach any conclusions about whether the 
    resource is effective. </p>
