<p class="heading">Informal introduction to some properties of probability</p>

<p>Whether probability is defined through sampling from a finite population, or 
sampling from a hypothetical infinite population, it obeys the same rules.</p>
<p>We only informally introduce some of the ideas here. It is easiest to understand 
them in the context of sampling a single value from a finite population.</p>
<p class="heading">Probabilities are always between 0 and 1</p>
<p>For any event, <em>A</em>,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>0 ≤ P(<em>A</em>) ≤ 1</strong></p>
</div></div>

<p>This follows from the fact that probabilities are really proportions.</p>
<p class="heading">Meaning of probabilities 0 and 1</p>
<p>For any event, <em>A</em>,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If the event <em>A</em> cannot happen then P(<em>A</em>) = 0<br>
If the event <em>A</em> is certain to happen then P(<em>A</em>) = 1</p>
</div></div>


<br>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Pregnancy of rats that are caught by traps in a wood</p>
<p>Consider the event that a trapped rat is 'both male and pregnant'. The probability 
of this event is 0 since it is impossible.</p>
<p>The probability that a trapped rat is 'either male or female' is 1 since it 
is certain that it will be one or other gender.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Probability that an event does not happen</p>
<p>For any event, <em>A</em>,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>P(<em>A</em> does not happen) = 1 - P(<em>A</em>)</p>
</div></div>

<br>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Marital status</p>
<p>If a proportion 0.6 of male adults are married, then a proportion (1 - 0.6) 
= 0.4 are not married. Since probabilities are really proportions, the same result 
holds for them.</p>
</div>
<p class="heading">Addition law</p>
<p>When two events cannot happen together, they are said to be <strong>mutually 
exclusive</strong>. For any two mutually exclusive events, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>P(<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>) = P(<em>A</em>) + P(<em>B</em>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>If the events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are <strong>not</strong> mutually exclusive,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>P(<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>) &lt; P(<em>A</em>) + P(<em>B</em>)</p>
</div></div>


<br>

<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Number of children</p>

<p>Let <em>X</em> denote the number of children that a woman will have. The possible 
values for <em>X</em> are 0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;..., and these values are mutually 
exclusive.</p>
<p>If P(<em>X</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.1, P(<em>X</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.3, 
P(<em>X</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.3, P(<em>X</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.3, 
then the probability that she will have fewer than 2 children is P(<em>X</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)&nbsp;+ 
P(<em>X</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.3&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.4.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Independence</p>
<p>When sampling two or more values at random <strong>with replacement</strong> 
from a population, the choice of each value does not depend on the values previously 
selected. The successive values are then called <strong>independent</strong>. 
</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In random sampling with replacement, or random sampling 
from an infinite population, successive values are independent.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On the other hand, if sampling without replacement from a finite population, 
successive sample values are <strong>not</strong> independent. The second value 
selected cannot be the same as the first value, so knowing the first value affects 
the probabilities when the second value is selected.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In random sampling without replacement from a finite 
population, successive values are <span class="black">not</span> independent.</p>
</div></div>


<p>Independence can be given a more precise definition, but this informal definition 
is enough for our purposes here.</p>

<p class="heading">Rolling dice</p>

<p>When two or more dice are rolled, this is usually done such that the second 
die has probability <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> for each value, irrespective of the value that appeared 
on the first die. The values that appear in the first and second dice are therefore independent.</p>

<p>In a later chapter, we will <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_independence')">extend 
some of these ideas about probability</a>.</p>
