<p><img src="images/overviewData.gif" width="154" height="124" align="right">We 
now consider a different type of data in which two different measurements are 
made from each of several groups. These groups are often different geographical 
regions. The measurements are called 'variables' and can be of dissimilar types 
(e.g. GDP and birth rate).</p>
<p class="heading">Scatterplots</p>
<p><img src="images/overviewCrosses.gif" width="134" height="115" align="right">A 
data set of this form is often displayed in a <strong>scatterplot</strong>. A 
scatterplot shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the strength of the relationship between the two types of measurement &mdash; are 
large values of one variable associated with large values of the other?</li>
<li>individual groups whose values of one variable are unusually high or low in 
relation to their values of the other variable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="heading">Showing size</p>
<p><img src="images/overviewCircles.gif" width="134" height="115" align="right">When 
the pairs of measurement are from different geographical regions (e.g. countries), 
these regions often differ greatly in size. The crosses in a scatterplot can be 
replaced by coloured circles whose areas are proportional to their sizes (e.g. 
population or GDP). Circle colour can represent continents or other groupings 
of the regions.</p>
<p class="heading">Nonlinear scales (advanced)</p>
<p>Some variables consist of many small measurements and a few much larger ones. 
The larger values can dominate a scatterplot, so a logarithmic scale is occasionally 
used to distinguish the smaller values. However a nonlinear scale should only 
be used in publications targetted at a more numerate audience.</p>
