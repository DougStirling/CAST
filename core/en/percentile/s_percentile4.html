<p class="heading notPrinted">Finding percentiles</p>
	<p>Given any proportion, <em>p</em>, 
		between 0 and 1, we can find a value <em>x</em> such that approximately this 
		proportion, <em>p</em>, of values is <em>x</em> or lower in our data set. 
		This is called the <em>p</em>'th <strong>quantile</strong> in the data set. 
		When <em>p</em> is given as a percentage, the same value is called the <em>p</em>'th <strong>percentile</strong>.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The <em>p</em>'th percentile is the value <em>x</em> such that <em>p</em> percent of the data set are <em>x</em> or lower.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>Percentiles can be read from a graph of the cumulative distribution function.</p>

	<p class=heading>Details (optional)</p>
	<p>It may not be possible to find a value, <em>x</em>, such that <strong>exactly </strong><em>p</em> percent
of the data are lower, expecially if the sample size is not a multiple of 100.
If <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;56, the cumulative distribution function is a step
function that rises by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>56</sub> at each data value, so it is
impossible to find an <em>x</em>-value for which exactly say 43% of values are
lower.</p>
<p>There is no universally accepted general definition of percentiles and different
statistical programs give slightly different values. The differences are minor
and should not affect your interpretation of the data.</p>
