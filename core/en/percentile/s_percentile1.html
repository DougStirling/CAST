<p class=heading>Annual rainfall in Samaru, Nigeria</p>
	<p>In most of Africa, the most important climatic variable is rainfall. Rainfall 
		is usually highly seasonal and failure of crops is normally associated with 
		late arrival of rain or low rainfall. A better understanding of the distribution 
		of rainfall can affect the crops that are grown and when they are planted.</p>
	<p>The  annual rainfall (in mm) in Samaru, Northern Nigeria between 
	1928 and 1983 will be used as an example in this section.</p>
