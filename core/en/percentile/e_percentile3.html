<p class="heading">Different ways to express a proportion</p>
  
<p>The proportion of times that an event occurs is often expressed as a percentage 
(rate per hundred). It can equivalently be expressed as a rates per <em>x</em> 
values (where <em>x</em> is a number different from 100) or as a 'return period'. 
If the event has return period <em>y</em>, it has a rate of once per <em>y</em> 
values. For annual climatic events, it is called a <em>y</em>-year event.</p>

<div class="diagram">
  
<p>The exercise below asks you to express a proportion in different ways.</p>

<div class="centred">
<script type="text/javascript">outputExercise("exercisePercentProg.PercentRateApplet", null, "propn,percent,rate,returnPeriod", document);</script>
</div>

  
<p>Repeat with several different questions. (Make sure that you try at least one 
that asks for a percentage, one asking for a rate and one that requires a return 
period.) </p>
