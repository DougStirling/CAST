<p class=heading>Different definitions of percentiles</p>
	<p>It was mentioned earlier that there are several competing definitions 
		of the upper and lower quartile. All such definitions split the data approximately 
		into quarters but there is not a unique way to do this.</p>
	<p>There is even less agreement about the precise definition of other percentiles, 
		and different computer software finds them in different ways. The definitions are usually based on a smoothed version of the cumulative distribution function.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_smoothCdf.gif" width="491" height="276"></p>
	<p>The differences between the different definitions are small if the data set
is large.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If your conclusion about the data would change 
				with a different definition of the percentiles, you are over-interpreting 
				the data.</p>
