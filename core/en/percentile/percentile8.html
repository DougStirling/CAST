<p class=heading>Different definitions of the quartiles</p>
	<p>There is universal agreement that the median of a data set is the middle 
		value if there is an odd number of observations, or half-way between the middle 
		two values if the size of the data set is even.</p>
	<p>However it was mentioned earlier that there are several competing definitions 
		of the upper and lower quartile. All such definitions split the data approximately 
		into quarters but there is not a unique way to do this. For example, if there 
		are <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;16 values in the data set, any value between the 
		4th and 5th values would cut off a quarter of the data. In this situation, 
		we have defined here the lower quartile to be half-way between these values, 
		but other authors and computer software define the lower quartile to be nearer 
		to the 4th value.</p>
	<p>The differences are of little practical importance.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If your conclusion about the data would change 
				with a different definition of the quartiles, you are over-interpreting 
				the data.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class=heading>Smoothing the cumulative proportions</p>
	<p>There is even less agreement about the precise definition of other percentiles, 
		and different computer software finds them in different ways. In the earlier 
		pages of this section, we defined the percentiles as the values that are found 
		from reading across and down the cumulative distribution function.</p>
	<p>Most statistical computer software  replaces the cumulative distribution 
		function (a step function) with a smoothed version before reading off the 
		percentiles. </p>
	<p>In practical terms, the difference is unimportant. If the data set is large, 
		there is likely to be little difference in the value of most percentiles. 
		If the data set is small, the percentile is likely to be more affected by 
		'randomness' of the data so the precise value is less important.</p>

		<p>Drag the red horizontal line to read off different quartiles. Observe that 
			the percentiles do not change smoothly, due to the steps in the cumulative 
			distribution function.</p>
		<p>Click the checkbox <strong>Smoothed</strong> to replace the cumulative 
			distribution function with a smoothed version. Again drag the horizontal 
			line to read the percentiles from this graph and observe that the percentiles 
			change without sharp jumps.</p>
		<p>(This smoothed graph gives the definition of the percentiles that is used 
			in many statistical computer programs.)</p>
