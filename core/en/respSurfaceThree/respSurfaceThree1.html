<p class="heading">Quadratic model for 3 factors</p>  
  <p>The quadratic response surface model for two numerical factors extends to 
    three factors with linear and quadratic terms for the three factors and interaction 
    terms between all pairs of factors. (Response surface models rarely model 
    higher-order interactions than 2-factor interactions.)</p>
  <p class=eqn><img src="images/quadModel.gif" width="487" height="133"> </p>
  <p>This model has <strong>10</strong> parameters defining the mean response 
    (plus the unknown standard deviation, σ), 
    so a considerable amount of data is needed to estimate the parameters accurately.</p>
  <p>Data from at least 10 design points (distinct combinations of levels of the 
    three parameters) are needed to get any estimates of the parameters. A 2<sup>3</sup> 
    factorial design only has 8 design points, so it does not allow the quadratic 
    model to be fitted, even if replicates at the centre point of the design are 
    added. </p>
  <p class="heading">Central composite design</p>
  <p>The most commonly used design for fitting a quadratic response surface to 
    three numerical factors is a <strong>central composite</strong> design. This 
    augments the 8 runs of a 2<sup>3</sup> factorial design with a further 2 design 
    points (called <strong>star points</strong>) for each factor in which that 
    factor takes values more extreme than the factorial levels and the other factors 
    are set at their average value. (The design can be explained better graphically 
    &mdash; see the diagram below.) There is usually only a single replicate for each 
    at these 14 design points.</p>
  <p>If the levels of each factor for the factorial part of the experiment are 
    coded as ±1, the design is <strong>rotatable</strong> if the extreme 
    values for the star points are ±1.682. In rotatable designs, predictions 
    are equally accurate in all directions round the centre point of the design.</p>
  <p>Several replicates are usually added at the centre point of the design to 
    help the estimates of curvature. More importantly, the replicates of the centre 
    point provide a good estimate of the error variance that can be used in analysis 
    of variance for testing the significance of the model terms.</p>
  <p class="heading">Box-Behnken design</p>
  <p>Central composite designs have one run of the experiment at a very high and 
    one run at a very low level for each factor. In some experiments, it may not 
    be feasible to run the experiment at such extreme levels. In this case, the 
    'extremes' for the star points may be reduced to values closer to ±1 
    than ±1.682.</p>
  <p>However an alternative design only uses 3 different levels for each factor. 
    A <strong>Box-Behnken</strong> design for three factors consists of three 
    sets of design points; each is conducted with one factor at its centre level 
    and is a 2<sup>2</sup> factorial design for the other two factors. Again, 
    several replicates of the centre point of the design are usually added. Box-Behnken 
    designs are also rotatable (or almost rotatable).</p>

    <p class="heading">Wastewater treatment in a refinery</p>
    <p>Scientists studied treatments to remove waste products from the water that 
      was output from a dewatering process of petroleum storage tanks. A <em>Disolved 
      Air Flotation</em> procedure was used and three factors were varied in the 
      experiment &mdash; the amounts of coagulant, flocculant and pH.</p>
    <p>The low and high levels of these factors for a 2<sup>3</sup> factorial 
      experiment are shown in the following table.</p>

    <p>The 2<sup>3</sup> factorial design does not allow a quadratic response 
      surface to be fitted.</p>
    <p>Select <strong>Central composite</strong> from the pop-up menu. This adds 
      star points at ±1.682 to the factorial design. Rotate the display 
      (dragging with the mouse or using the rotation buttons) to understand better 
      the location of the star points. Observe that each star point involves one 
      factor at a level more extreme than the values in the table above.</p>
    <p>A central composite design is usually augmented by several replicates of 
      the centre point of the design. Use the control on the right to add six 
      replicate of the centre point.</p>
    <p>Finally select <strong>Box-Behnken</strong> from the pop-up menu. The design 
      points are in the centres of each edge of a cube (possibly with additional 
      replicates of the design's centre point). This design only uses three different 
      levels for each factor.</p>
