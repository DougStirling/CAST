<p class="heading">Differences between experimental units</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The experimental units are <strong>usually not identical</strong> &mdash; they have 
characteristics that affect the response.</p>
</div></div>


<dl>
<dt>Experiment on sheep</dt>
<dd>The sheep in a herd will have a variety of ages, weights and other characteristics. 
Even with no treatment applied, the weight gain in 6 months will vary from sheep 
to sheep.</dd>
<dt>Experiment on debtors</dt>
<dd>A dentist wants to assess whether a friendly letter or a threatening letter 
      (the experimental treatment) is more effective at getting debtors to pay 
      their bills. 
The experimental units are the debtors and they vary in age, gender and other 
characteristics that affect their likelihood of responding to the letter.</dd>
<dt>Experiment on flowers grown in a greenhouse</dt>
<dd>Some plants will be nearer to the windows, heat sources, ventilation, etc, 
than others. Some plants will also be naturally more vigorous than others.</dd>
<dt>Experiment about chemical reaction</dt>
<dd>In an experiment to assess the effect of an enzyme (the treatment) on a chemical 
reaction, the reaction will be repeated several times 
with different amounts of enzyme. The successive runs of the experiment are the experimental units and, although he experimenter will try to keep experimental 
conditions as constant as possible, some of aspects may change over the course of the experiment &mdash; the 
temperature may change during the day or the technician may improve the experimental 
technique in some subtle way.</dd>

<p class=heading>Weight gain of calves</p>

    
<p>An experiment is to be conducted to assess whether a feed supplement improves 
the weight gain of calves over a 2-month period. Eighteen calves are available 
for use in the experiment. These calves vary in their age and weight at the start 
of the experiment, as shown in the scatterplot below.</p>
    <p>We initially consider the weight gains of the calves <strong>if none of 
      them are given the feed supplement</strong>. Even without being given a 
      supplement, the weight gains of the calves will vary and some of this variability 
      is likely to be related to the initial ages and weights.</p>

    <p>The diagram is 3-dimensional, so move the mouse to the centre (marked by 
      either a pink circle or the pointer changing to a hand) and drag towards 
      the top left to rotate. (Or click the <strong>y-x-z</strong> rotation button.) 
      The third dimension shows weight gains for the calves.</p>
    <p>Click the <strong>y-x</strong> and the <strong>y-z</strong> rotation buttons 
      and observe that weight gain is associated with both age and initial weight. 
      (The calves that are older and heavier at the start of the experiment tend 
      to gain more weight.)</p>
    
<p>Click <strong>Repeat experiment</strong> to run the experiment with a different 
group of 18 calves that have the same initial ages and weights.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Remember that we are <strong>not interested</strong> 
					on the effect of age and initial weight on weight gain<strong>.</strong></p>
</div></div>

		
    <p>We want to use these calves to assess the effect of a <strong>feed supplement</strong> 
      on weight gain so the effect of age and initial weight only serves to complicate 
      the experiment.</p>
