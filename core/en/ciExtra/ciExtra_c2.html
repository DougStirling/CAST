<p class="heading">How much data do I need to collect?</p>

<p>This is one of the most common questions that statistical consultants are asked. 
Data collection is expensive, so there is a clear desire to keep sample sizes 
as low as possible. However insufficient data means that the parameters of interest 
cannot be estimated accurately enough.</p>
<p>Consider estimation of a population mean, µ, 
from a random sample of size <em>n</em>. A 95% confidence interval will be of 
the form</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciMean/images/plusMinusTSE.gif" width="93" height="32"> 
</p>
<p>If we want our estimate to be within <em>k</em> of µ 
with probability 0.95, then we need <em>n</em> to be large enough that</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/meanInequality.gif" width="105" height="29"> </p>
<p>Provided we can make a reasonable guess at the likely value of the sample standard 
deviation, <em>s</em>, 
it is possible to determine the necessary sample size by trial-and-error in the 
above inequality.</p>

<p class="heading">Account valuation</p>

<p>As part of an annual review of its accounts, a discount brokerage selected 
a random sample of 36 customers. Their accounts were reviewed for total account 
valuation, which showed a mean of $32,000 and a sample standard deviation of $8,200.</p>
<p>The mean account valuation was estimated from this survey with the 95% confidence 
interval $32,000 ±&nbsp;2,780. The brokerage decided that this estimate 
was not accurate enough.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How many accounts should be examined to estimate the mean account 
valuation to within $1,000 with probability 0.95?</p>
</div></div>

<p>The following diagram helps with the calculations.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="400" height="300">

<p>Drag the slider to set the standard deviation to $8,200 &mdash; our best estimate 
from the pilot survey.</p>
<p>Drag the sample size slider until the '±' value is less than 1000.Verify 
that the sample size should be 260 or higher. </p>
<p class="gray">(The diagram can also be used if a maximum standard error 
or confidence interval width has been specified.)</p>

<p class="heading">Obtaining the sample size by solving an equation</p>

<p>Provided the sample size will be reasonably large, it is possible to replace 
the t-value in the above inequality by 1.96. For our estimate to be within <em>k</em> 
of µ 
with probability 0.95, we therefore need</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/meanInequality2.gif" width="94" height="29"> </p>
<p>This inequality can be re-written in the form</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/nForMean.gif" width="99" height="41"> </p>
<p>In practice, it is best to increase <em>n</em> a little over this value in 
case the sample standard deviation was wrongly guessed.</p>
