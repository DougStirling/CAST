<p class="heading">How much data do I need to collect?</p>
	<p>Consider estimation of a population mean, µ, 
		from a random sample of size <em>n</em>. A 95% confidence interval will be of 
		the form</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciMean/images/plusMinusTSE.gif" width="93" height="32"> </p>
	<p>If we want our estimate to be within <em>k</em> of µ 
		with probability 0.95, then we need <em>n</em> to be large enough that</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/meanInequality.gif" width="105" height="29"> </p>
	<p>Provided we can make a reasonable guess at the likely value of the sample standard 
		deviation, <em>s</em>, 
		it is possible to determine the necessary sample size by trial-and-error in the 
		above inequality.</p>
	<p class="heading">Equation for the sample size</p>
	<p>If <em>n</em> is reasonably large 
		the t-value in the  inequality will be approximately 1.96, so</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/meanInequality2.gif" width="94" height="29"></p>
	<p>This inequality can be re-written in the form</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/nForMean.gif" width="99" height="41"> </p>
	<p>In practice, it is best to increase <em>n</em> a little over this value in 
		case the sample standard deviation was wrongly guessed.</p>
	<p class="heading">Example</p>
	<p>If we expect that a particular type of measurement will have a standard deviation of about 8, and we want to estimate its mean, µ, to within 2 of its correct value with probability 0.95, the sample size should be</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/s_sampleSize.gif" width="169" height="40" align="absmiddle"></p>
	<p>This suggests a sample size of at least 62. (The more accurate trial-and-error method using a t-value would give a sample size of 64.)</p>
