<p class="heading">How much data do I need to collect?</p>

<p>This is one of the most common questions that statistical consultants are asked. 
Data collection is expensive, so there is a clear desire to keep sample sizes 
as low as possible. However insufficient data means that the parameters of interest 
cannot be estimated accurately enough.</p>

<p class="heading">How many accounts should be reviewed?</p>

<p>We now give an example that finds the sample size needed to estimate
a population mean with specified accuracy.</p>

<p class="heading">Obtaining the sample size by solving an equation</p>

<p>Provided the sample size will be reasonably large, it is possible to replace 
the t-value in the above inequality by 1.96. For our estimate to be within <em>k</em> 
of Âµ 
with probability 0.95, we therefore need</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/meanInequality2.gif" width="94" height="29"></p>
<p>This inequality can be re-written in the form</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/nForMean.gif" width="99" height="41"> </p>
<p>In practice, it is best to increase <em>n</em> a little over this value in 
case the sample standard deviation was wrongly guessed.</p>
