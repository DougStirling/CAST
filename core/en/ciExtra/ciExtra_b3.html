<p class="heading">How much data do I need to collect?</p>

<p>In the previous page, we investigated how to determine the sample size needed 
to estimate a population mean to a specified accuracy. A similar calculation can 
be used to find the size of sample required for estimating a probability.</p>
<p>A 95% confidence interval for a probability π 
is of the form</p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../estPropn/images/ciP.gif" width="141" height="46"> </p>
<p>If we want our estimate to be within <em>k</em> of π 
with probability 0.95, then we need <em>n</em> to be large enough that</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/propInequality.gif" width="138" height="43"> </p>

<p>In order to use this inequality, we need a guess at the value of <em>p</em> &mdash; it does not need to be particularly accurate.</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A small pilot survey is often conducted to obtain a preliminary 
estimate for the proportion.</p>
</div></div>


<p>If we can do no better, the 'worst-case' value, <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5 
can be used, but the resulting sample size may be higher than needed. </p>
<p>The necessary sample size can be found by trial-and-error in the above inequality.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Survival from lung cancer">
<p class="heading">Survival from lung cancer</p>

<p>Health researchers want to estimate the proportion of lung cancer patients 
that survive five years after diagnosis.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How many patient records must be examined to be at least 95% confident that 
the resulting estimate will be within 2% of the true population proportion?</p>
</div></div>

<p>The following diagram helps with the calculations.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="400" height="300">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="inferenceProg.FindNForPiApplet">
<param name="maxWidth" value="9.0000">
<param name="guessLimits" value="0.01 0.99 0.4 98">
<param name="nLimits" value="300 3000 1000">
<param name="customText" value="Guess at value of * (and p)=Guess at value of * (and p)">
</applet>
</div>

<p>We have not been given a guess at the value of π, 
so drag the slider to 0.5 &mdash; the worst-case scenario. <span class="gray">(Use the arrow keys on your keyboard for fine adjustment of π.)</span></p>
<p>Drag the sample size slider until the '±' value is less than 0.02. Verify 
that the sample size should be about 2,500 or higher.</p>
<hr align="center" width="75%">
<p>Recent reports about survival rates from lung cancer have claimed that the five-year survival rate is only between 8% and 14%, due to the late diagnosis of the disease in many patients. We 
may feel that it is safe to assume that the current survival rate is no higher than 
20%. Use the slider to change the guess of π 
to 0.20 in the diagram above and verify that a sample size of about 1,600 would 
be enough to estimate π 
to within 0.02 with 95% confidence.</p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Obtaining the sample size by solving an equation</p>

<p>Trial-and-error can be avoided with a little algebra. The equation</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciExtra/images/propInequality.gif" width="138" height="43"> </p>
<p>can be re-written in the form</p>
