<p class="heading">Additive models</p>
	<p>We  assumed earlier that the four time series
		components affect it additively.</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue" style="font-weight:bold">Deseasonalised&nbsp; = &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; + &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; + &nbsp; Residual</span> </p>
	<p>This implies that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The difference between the 
		January and July values is approximately the same each year.</li>
		<li>The residuals are roughly the same sizes 
		throughout the series.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The seasonal pattern has greater magnitude at
the end of the following time series than at its start, so an additive model
is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_seasonalData.gif" width="468" height="253"></p>
	<p class="heading">Multiplicative models</p>
	<p>In many time series, the absolute differences in the values are of less interest
and importance than the percentage changes. A <strong>multiplicative
model</strong> assumes that seasonal and other effects act proportionally on
the series:</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong>Data &nbsp; = &nbsp; (Seasonal effect) &nbsp; &times; &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; &times; &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; &times; &nbsp; Residual</strong></span> </p>
	<p>After taking logarithms (either natural logarithms or to base 10), the four 
	components of the time series again act additively.</p>
	<table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="color:#009; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<tr>
<td valign="top" rowspan="2"><strong>log(Data) &nbsp;</strong></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><strong>= &nbsp; log(Seasonal effect &nbsp; × &nbsp; Trend &nbsp; × &nbsp; Cyclical &nbsp; × &nbsp; Residual)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><strong>= &nbsp; log(Seasonal effect) &nbsp;+ &nbsp;log(Trend) &nbsp;+ &nbsp;log(Cyclical) &nbsp;+ &nbsp;log(Residual)</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>To fit a multiplicative model, analyse the logarithms of the 
	data with an additive model.</p>
