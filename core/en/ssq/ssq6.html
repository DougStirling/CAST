	<p>Individual differences of values from the population mean can be split,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Since the population mean, µ, is an unknown value in practice, this partition of the total sum of 
						squares is of little practical use.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>However the total sum of squares about the <strong>sample</strong> mean can 
		often be split into components in a similar way.</p>
	<p class="heading">Normal models</p>
	<p>You have already encountered several models for data based on normal distributions:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Univariate:</dt>
	</dl>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="centred"><tr>
<td valign="middle"><img src="images/univarNormModel.gif" width="137" height="21"></td>
<td valign="middle"> &nbsp; for the <em>i</em>'th value in the data set.</td>
</tr></table></div>

	<dl>
		<dt>Regression:</dt>
	</dl>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="centred"><tr>
<td valign="middle"><img src="images/regnModel.gif" width="199" height="21"></td>
<td valign="middle"> &nbsp; for the <em>i</em>'th value in the data set.</td>
</tr></table></div>

	<dl>
		<dt>Several groups:</dt>
	</dl>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="centred"><tr>
<td valign="middle"><img src="images/groupModel.gif" width="143" height="23"></td>
<td valign="middle">&nbsp; for the <em>j</em>'th value in group <em>i</em>.</td>
</tr></table></div>

	<p class="heading">Splitting the sum of squares about the sample mean</p>
	<p>For these and many other models based on normal distributions, the difference 
		between each value and the sample mean can be further split into two or more 
		components,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/generalComponents.gif" width="279" height="24"></p>
	<p>and their sums of squares are similarly related: </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/generalComponentSsq.gif" width="323" height="28"></p>
	<p>It is conventional in these models to call the sum of squares on the left 
		the <strong>total sum of squares</strong> &mdash; strictly it is the sum of squares 
		about the sample mean.</p>
	<p class="heading">Analysis of variance table</p>
	<p>These component sums of squares can be again arranged in a table called an 
		<strong>analysis of variance (anova) table</strong>. </p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/generalAnovaTable2.gif" width="444" height="197"></p>
	<p>When some assumptions are made about the normal model underlying the data, 
		each sum of squares has a chi-squared distribution with a number of degrees 
		of freedom that depends on how the components are defined.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The mean sums of squares are therefore all estimates of σ<sup>2</sup> 
						if these same assumptions hold.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">F ratios and hypothesis tests</p>
	<p>In practice, we assume that the data arise from some normal model.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The components are defined in such a way 
						that each is sensitive to a different characteristic of the model.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The component sums of squares can therefore be used as a basis for <strong>testing</strong> 
	whether the model has these characteristics.</p>
<p>Tests are done by comparing pairs of mean sums of squares. An unusually large 
	ratio indicates that the model does not have some characteristic. A column 
	of F-ratios of mean sums of squares (usually compared to the final one in 
	the table) is the basis of the test and a p-value is found by comparing the 
	F-ratios with an F distribution.</p>
