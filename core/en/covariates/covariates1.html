<p class="heading">Variability</p>
  <p>In many experiments, there is little control of the  experimental units that are available for use, and they are therefore often very variable.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Ideally we might prefer to conduct an experiment on cows of the same age, weight, height and body condition, but in practice we will need to use a single herd that inevitably contains  cows in which all of these characteristics vary.</li>
  	<li>Ideally we would prefer to grow tomato plants in a glasshouse such that each gets identical light levels, ventilation and irrigation, but the physical layout of the glasshouse often necessitates use of different shelves to fit in the necessary number of plants.</li>
  	<li>Ideally a field experiment will measure crop yields from plots of land with identical soils, moisture content and shading from neighbouring trees, but in practice we may not be able to find enough identical plots on the research station.</li>
 	</ul>
  <p>This variability affects both the design  of the experiment and also the analysis that is used to compare the experimental treatments.</p>
  <p class="heading">Design</p>
  <p>Sometimes we have measurements from the experimental units that explain (or partially explain) the differences between them <strong>before</strong> the experiment is started.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>The fat content of the milk from all cows in a herd are known from regular testing.</li>
 		<li>It is known that plants in different rows of a glasshouse probably get different amounts of light.</li>
 		<li>If a sloping field is split into plots, the moisture level in the lower plots may be higher.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These measurements should be used to group the experimental units into blocks of similar units and a randomised block design should be used.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>The design of the experiment should use known differences between the experimental units. </p>
  </div></div>
  <p>Other measurements called  <strong>covariates</strong> may be made <strong>after</strong> the experiment has been designed that can also be used to explain variability between the experimental units. (Some authors only use this term to describe numerical characteristics and use the term 'cofactor' for categorical measurements. We use the term covariates for both here.)</p>
  <ul>
		<li>Meters may be installed in each row of a glasshouse to  record incident light levels when the experiment is being run.</li>
 		<li>During the experiment, soil samples may be analysed from each plot and their moisture level and organic content measured.</li>
  </ul>
	<br>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>Covariates cannot affect the design of the experiment (since their values are unknown before the experiment is designed. </p>
  </div></div>
  <p class="heading">Analysis</p>
  <p>Provided the experimental treatments are randomised (either overall or within blocks), the experimental data are analysed in an identical way whatever the design. In all situations,</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>We should use any available information about the causes of variability in the experimental units to explain variability in the response. </p>
  </div></div>
  <p>This is done by adding one or more terms to the model for the response and reduces the unexplained variability (the residual sum of squares). The remaining pages in this section give more detail about how this is done.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>Reducing unexplained variability makes hypothesis tests  more sensitive to differences between the treatments </p>
