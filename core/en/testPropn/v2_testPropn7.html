<p class="heading">Test statistic and p-value</p>
<p>The statistical distance of an estimate to the null hypothesis parameter value
can be used as a test statistic.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'testPropn', 'zTest', '478', '398');</script>

<p class="heading">Refinements</p>
<p>If the standard error of the estimate must itself be estimated from the sample
data, the above test statistic is only approximately normally distributed. In
some tests that we will describe in later sections, the test statistic has a
t distribution (which has slightly longer tails than the standard normal distribution).
This refinement will be described fully in the next section.</p>

<p class="heading">Relation to previous test</p>
<p>The p-value obtained in this way using a 'statistical distance' as the test
statistic is <strong>identical</strong> to the p-value  that
was found from a normal approximation to the number of successes
<strong>without</strong> a continuity correction. (The p-value is slightly different
if a continuity correction is used.)</p>
<p>The use of 'statistical distances' does not add anything when testing a sample
proportion, but it is a general method that will be used to obtain test statistics
in many other situations later in this e-book.</p>
