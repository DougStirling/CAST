<p class=heading>Test statistic</p>
<p>A test about a probability, π, could be based on the corresponding sample proportion, <em>p</em>,
but it is  more
convenient to use the <strong>number</strong> of successes, <em>x</em>,
rather than <em>p</em> since we know its distribution,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed percent50">
<p><em>X</em>&nbsp; ~ &nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">binomial</font> (<em>n</em>&nbsp;, &pi;)</p>
</div></div>

<p class=heading>P-value</p>
<p>The p-value is the probability of getting such an 'extreme'
set of data if the null hypothesis is true. Since we know the binomial distribution
of <em>X</em> when the null hypothesis
holds,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The p-value is a sum of binomial probabilities</p>
</div></div>

<p>Note that the p-value can be obtained exactly <strong>without need for simulations
or randomisation</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading>Example</p>
<p>In 100 values from a categorical population, 72 successes were observed. Is this
consistent with probability π = 0.80 of success, or is the probability of success
lower?</p>
<p class="eqn"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.80</p>
<p class="eqn"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.80</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis is true, we know the distribution of the number of successes, <em>X</em>,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_binom.gif" width="356" height="212"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the probability of observing 72 or fewer successes,
assuming that the null hypothesis holds. Since this is 0.0342, we conclude that there
would be little chance of seeing as low a number of successes if π = 0.80, so</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is moderately strong evidence that<span class="eqn"> π&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.80</span></p>
