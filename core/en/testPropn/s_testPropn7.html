<p class="heading notPrinted">Test statistic and p-value</p>
<p>The <strong>statistical distance</strong> of an estimate to a hypothesised
value of the underlying parameter is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/zGeneral.gif" width="185" height="37"></p>
<p>If the null hypothesis holds, <em>z</em> has
approximately a standard normal distribution and it can be used as a test statistic
for tests about the parameter. The p-value can be determined from the tail areas
of this standard normal distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/pValueFromZ.gif" width="471" height="212"></p>
<p>For a two-tailed test, the p-value is the red tail area and can be looked
up using either normal tables or in Excel.</p>
<p class=heading>Example</p>
<p>We again examine a data set in which 369 out of 899 home-based businesses
were owned by women. Are less than 50% of such businesses owned by women?</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.5</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; 0.5</strong></span></p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the 'statistical distance' of the sample proportion
from 0.5 is calculated.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_testP.gif" width="419" height="224"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the lower tail area of the standard normal distribution
and is virtually zero here, so we again conclude that it is almost certain that
less than 50% of such businesses are owned by women.</p>
<p>Using a 'statistical distance' to test a proportion gives a p-value that is <strong>identical</strong> to
the p-value based on a normal approximation to the number of successes <strong>without</strong> a
continuity correction. (The p-value is slightly different if a continuity correction
is used.) However this approach will  be used to  test many different
kinds of parameter in later sections.</p>
<p>(The procedure will be refined slightly 
when applied to situations where the standard error of the estimate must itself
be estimated from the sample data. A t distribution will be used instead of a
standard normal distribution.)</p>
