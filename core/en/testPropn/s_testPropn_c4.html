<p class="heading">P-value for a one-tailed test</p>
<p>Consider a test of the hypotheses</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span> </p>
<p>where π<sub>0</sub> is a constant of interest. The following diagram shows
how the p-value is found:</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/testProcessA.gif" width="441" height="265"> </p>
<p>Since the probabilities in one tail of the distribution are added, this is
called a <strong>one-tailed test</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">P-value for a two-tailed test</p>
<p>If the alternative hypothesis allows <strong>either high or low</strong> values
of <em>x</em>, the test is called a <strong>two-tailed</strong> test, </p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; </strong>&pi;<strong><sub>0</sub></strong></span></p>
<p>The p-value is then <strong>double the smaller tail probability</strong> since
values of <em>x</em> in <strong>both</strong> tails of the binomial distribution
would provide evidence for <b>H<sub>A</sub></b>.</p>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
<p>A survey of  124 companies  found that 97
had their own ethics codes. Two years previously, it was believed that 72%
of companies had ethics codes, so is there any evidence that the proportion has changed?
This question can be expressed with the hypotheses</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.72</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 0.72</strong></span></p>
<p>If the current proportion of companies with ethics codes is π = 0.72,
the sampled number out of 124  would have the binomial distribution
below.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_binom2Tail_c.gif" width="356" height="212"></p>
<p>There is a probability 0.0718 of getting 97 or more, but small sample numbers
with ethics codes would <strong>also</strong> throw doubt on the null hypothesis,
so the p-value is <strong>double</strong> the high-tail probability, 0.1436.</p>
<p>From the large p-value, we conclude that there is no evidence that the
proportion with ethics codes has changed from its value two years ago.</p>
