<p class=heading>Another example</p>
<p>The following example shows again how the binomial distribution can be used 
to obtain the p-value for a test about a population probability.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Design of mustard jar">
<p class=heading>Design of mustard jar</p>
<p>In the trial of three new designs for a mustard jar that was described at the start of this section, 
all three were offered for sale at the same price in a supermarket. Out of the first 
90 jars that were purchased, 36 chose the design that was more expensive to manufacture 
than the other two. Since more than a third chose this  design for the mustard jar, is there strong 
evidence that customers prefer it? </p>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses are...</p>

<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp;π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(no 
preference)</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp;π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(preference 
for the expensive design)</p>

<p>The p-value is the probability of 36 or more expensive designs being purchased
when π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. 
This can be obtained directly from a binomial distribution with π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> 
and <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;90. </p>

<p>Use the slider below to obtain the p-value for this test.
</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="420" height="280">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="testProg.SuccessPValueApplet">
<param name="testParams" value="90 0.3333 30">
<param name="testTail" value="high">
<param name="successName" value="expensive design">
<param name="customText" value="count of=count of">
</applet>
</div>

<p>The p-value for the test is 0.1103, meaning that there is a probability of 
0.1103 of the expensive design being purchased 36 of more times even if there is 
no real preference for it. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence of 
any preference from the data.</p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Interpretation of p-values</p>
<p>If the p-value for a test is very small, the data are 'inconsistent' with the 
null hypothesis. (The observed data may still be possible, but are at least extremely 
unlikely.)</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>From a very small p-value, we can conclude that the null 
hypothesis is probably wrong.</p>
</div></div>

<p>However a high p-value cannot allow us to conclude that the null hypothesis 
is correct &mdash; only that the observed data are consistent with it. For example, 
if exactly 30 expensive cases (a third) were purchased in the CD-case example 
above, it would be wrong to conclude that there was no preference for it. The 
data are also consistent with other values of π 
near <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, so we cannot conclude that π 
is not 0.32 or 0.34.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A hypothesis test can never conclude that the null hypothesis 
is correct.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The correct interpretation of p-values for the CD-case experiment would be...</p>
