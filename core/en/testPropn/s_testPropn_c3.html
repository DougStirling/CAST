<p class=heading>Design of CD case</p>
<p>In an experiment comparing three CD cases,
all three designs were offered for sale in a CD store for the same price. Out
of the first 90 CDs that were purchased, 36 were for the more expensive design.
Testing for whether there is any preference for the more expensive case involves
the probability of this case being selected, π.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(no
preference)</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(preference
for expensive case)</p>
<p>If there is no preference, the number of expensive cases purchased will be
binomial with π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;90. </p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_binom2_c.gif" width="356" height="212"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the probability of getting as 'extreme' a count
as was observed if there was no preference, 0.1103. Since this is high, we
conclude that there is no evidence of preference for the more expensive case
from the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Interpretation of p-values</p>
<p>A p-value only tells you whether the data are consistent with the null hypothesis
or are inconsistent with it. From a very small p-value, we can conclude that
the null hypothesis is probably wrong. However a high p-value does not mean that
the null hypothesis is correct, only that the observed data are consistent with
it. In the CD case example, we could never be sure that π was not very very slightly
different from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>A hypothesis test should never conclude that the null hypothesis
