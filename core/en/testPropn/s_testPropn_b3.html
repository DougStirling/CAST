<p class=heading>Rat recognition of symbols</p>
<p>In an experiment, a rat was trained to 'recognise' three symbols by placing
food in one of three boxes (marked with a circle, cross and square) and shown
a card with the correct symbol, this being repeated 100 times.</p>
<p>After this training period, 90 cards were presented to the rat and the box
with the same symbol was picked 36 times.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(guessing)</p>
<p align="center"><strong>H<sub>A</sub>:</strong> &nbsp; π&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(learned)</p>
<p>If the rat is guessing, the number of correct choices will be binomial with
π&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;90. </p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_binom2_b.gif" width="356" height="212"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the probability of getting as 'extreme' a count
as was observed if the rat guesses, 0.1103. Since this is high, we
conclude that there is no evidence of learning from the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Interpretation of p-values</p>
<p>A p-value only tells you whether the data are consistent with the null hypothesis
or are inconsistent with it. From a very small p-value, we can conclude that
the null hypothesis is probably wrong. However a high p-value does not mean that
the null hypothesis is correct, only that the observed data are consistent with
it. In the rat training example, we could never be sure that π was not very very
slightly different from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>A hypothesis test should never conclude that the null hypothesis
is correct.</p>
