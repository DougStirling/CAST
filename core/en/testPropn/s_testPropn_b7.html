<p class="heading notPrinted">Test statistic and p-value</p>
<p>The <strong>statistical distance</strong> of an estimate to a hypothesised
value of the underlying parameter is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/zGeneral.gif" width="185" height="37"></p>
<p>If the null hypothesis holds, <em>z</em> has
approximately a standard normal distribution and it can be used as a test statistic
for tests about the parameter. The p-value can be determined from the tail areas
of this standard normal distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="gif" src="../testMean/images/pValueFromZ.gif" width="471" height="212"></p>
<p>For a two-tailed test, the p-value is the red tail area and can be looked
up using either normal tables or in Excel.</p>
<p class=heading>Example</p>
<p>We again examine a data set in which a proportion <sup>37</sup>/<sub>2500</sub> = 0.0148 of
2,500 patients had adverse reactions to a drug. Do more than 1% of such patients
have adverse reactions?</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="darkblue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.01</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&pi;<strong> &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; 0.01</strong></span></p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the 'statistical distance' of the sample proportion
from 0.01 is calculated.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_testP_b.gif" width="419" height="224"></p>
<p>The p-value for the test is the upper tail area of the standard normal distribution
and is 0.0079 here, so we again conclude that there is strong evidence that more
than 1% of patients have adverse reactions from the drug.</p>
<p>Using a 'statistical distance' to test a proportion gives a p-value that is <strong>identical</strong> to
the p-value based on a normal approximation to the number of successes <strong>without</strong> a
continuity correction. (The p-value is slightly different if a continuity correction
is used.) However this approach will  be used to  test many different
kinds of parameter in later sections.</p>
<p>(The procedure will be refined slightly 
when applied to situations where the standard error of the estimate must itself
be estimated from the sample data. A t distribution will be used instead of a
standard normal distribution.)</p>
