<p class=heading>Displays show the distribution of values in the data</p>

  <p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, graphical displays such as 
  dot plots, stem and leaf plots or histograms show clearly the <strong>distribution of values</strong> in the data — what kind of values are most common in the data and what values are less common. Three important features of the distribution are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
		<li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
		<li>The <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We will examine the 
		concepts of centre and spread in more detail later.</p>
	
<div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Wind speed</p>
		<p>As part of a study of pollution levels in the UK, wind speed (mph) was 
			measured on 114 successive days in 1990. (Levels of pullutants in the atmosphere 
			were also recorded, but will not be examined here.)</p>
		<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="images/windSpeed.gif" width="400" height="137"></div>
		<p>No outliers or clusters are evident in the data.</p>
    <p>However the display shows clearly the day-to-day variability in wind speed. 
			At the same location in the following year, we would expect about half the 
			days to have a wind speed below 9 mph, and perhaps one day in five to have 
			wind speed of 15 mph or higher. </p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Symmetry and skewness</p>
<p>If the density tails off in a similar way at both ends of the distribution, 
we call the distribution <strong>symmetric</strong>. If one side of the distribution 
tails off more slowly, we say that the distribution is <strong>skew</strong>.</p>

  <div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Wind speed</p>
		<p>The wind speed data have a reasonably symmetric distribution, though there 
			is perhaps a slightly longer tail to the right.</p>
		<p class="heading">Storm duration</p>
		<p>In a detailed hydrological study in Malawi, rainfall data were collected 
			from a continuously recording rain gauge installed in Bvumbwe catchment. 
			The durations (minutes) of the first 50 storms in the 1983/4 rainy season 
			are shown in the stacked dot plot below.</p>
		<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="images/stormDuration.gif" width="396" height="126"></div>
		<p>A 'typical' storm duration is say 100 minutes. Although none of the storms 
			lasted less than 100 minutes less than this (negative durations are impossible!), 
			nine of them had duration more than 100 minutes greater than this 'typical' 
			value and several were very long. This distribution is therefore skew with 
			a long tail towards the higher durations.</p>
