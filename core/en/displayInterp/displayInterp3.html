<p class=heading>Displays show the distribution of values in the data</p>

  <p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, graphical displays such as 
    dot plots, stem and leaf plots or histograms show clearly the <strong>distribution of values</strong> in the data — what kind of values are most common in the data and what values are less common. Three important features of the distribution are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
  <li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
  <li>The <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
</ul>

  <p>We will examine the 
    concepts of centre and spread in more detail later.</p>

<p class="heading">Isometric Strength Data</p>
<p>The stacked dot plot below shows the distribution of strengths of 41 male Hong Kong students
when lifting a horizontal bar 400 mm away from their feet.
</p>
    <div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="images/mvisDotPlot.gif" width="393" height="85"></div>
<p>There are no outliers or noteworthy clusters in the data.</p>
    <p>However the display shows clearly the student-to-student variability in 
			strengths. If similar data were collected from other students, we would 
			expect about three quarters to be able to exert a force of between 10kg 
			and 30kg, with perhaps one in ten being over 40kg and hardly anyone being 
			below 10kg. </p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Symmetry and skewness</p>
<p>If the density tails off in a similar way at both ends of the distribution, 
we call the distribution <strong>symmetric</strong>. If one side of the distribution 
tails off more slowly, we say that the distribution is <strong>skew</strong>.</p>

  <div class="diagram"> 
    <p>The centre of the Isometric Strength distribution describes a 'typical' 
			value &mdash; say just over 20 kg. Although no individuals have strength 15 kg 
			below this, a few have strengths up to 30 kg above this 'centre'. The distribution 
			is therefore slightly skew with a long tail towards the higher strengths.</p>
