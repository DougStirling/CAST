<p>Features in the distribution <strong>of a small data set</strong> may not
be meaningful.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Be careful <strong>not to overinterpret</strong> patterns in small
		data sets. Clusters, outliers or skewness may appear by chance even if there is
		no meaningful basis to these features. </p>
<p>Pronounced outliers or clusters may be taken as indicative of
		something meaningful in the underlying process. However <strong>less pronounced
			outliers or clusters must be supported by outside evidence</strong> before these features
		can be interpreted as meaningful.</p>
