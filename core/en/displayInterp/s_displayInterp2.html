<p class="heading notPrinted">Clusters</p>
	<p>If a dot plot, stem and leaf plot or histogram separates into two or more
groups of  values (clusters), this suggests that there may be more fundamental
differences between the 'individuals' in the groups.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_clusters.gif" width="499" height="140"></p>
	<p>Further investigation	should be made of	the individuals in the  clusters to find whether they also differ in other ways.</p>
	<p>If the clusters were less distinct, especially in small data sets, you would need external supporting evidence before concluding that the individuals separated into meaningful groups.</p>
