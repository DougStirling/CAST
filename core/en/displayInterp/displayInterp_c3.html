<p class=heading>Displays show the distribution of values in the data</p>

  <p>Even when a data set has no outliers or clusters, graphical displays such as 
  dot plots, stem and leaf plots or histograms show clearly the <strong>distribution of values</strong> in the data — what kind of values are most common in the data and what values are less common. Three important features of the distribution are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>centre</strong> or <strong>location</strong> of the distribution — a 'typical value'</li>
		<li>The<strong> spread</strong> or <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution</li>
		<li>The <strong>shape</strong> of the distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We will examine the 
		concepts of centre and spread in more detail later.</p>
	
<div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Holiday Home Rental data</p>
		<p>The stacked dot plot below shows the distribution of the monthly rent asked 
			for 41 houses in a holiday resort. </p>
		<div class="centred"><img class="gif" src="images/rentalDotPlot.gif" width="393" height="85"></div>
<p>There are no outliers or noteworthy clusters in the data.</p>
		<p>However the display shows clearly the house-to-house variability in rentals. 
      If similar data were collected from other houses, we would explect about 
      three quarters to charge between $1000 and $3000 per month, with perhaps 
      one in ten being over $4000 per month and hardly any houses being below 
      $1000. </p>
</div>

<p class="heading">Symmetry and skewness</p>
<p>If the density tails off in a similar way at both ends of the distribution, 
we call the distribution <strong>symmetric</strong>. If one side of the distribution 
tails off more slowly, we say that the distribution is <strong>skew</strong>.</p>

  <div class="diagram"> 
    <p>The centre of the Holiday Home Rental distribution describes a 'typical' 
      value &mdash; say just over $2000 per month. Although no houses are $1500 below 
      this, a few have strengths up to $3000 above this 'centre'. The distribution 
      is therefore skew with a long tail towards the higher prices.</p>
