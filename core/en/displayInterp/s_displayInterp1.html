	<p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data are 
		called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>
	<p>An outlier may have been 
		incorrectly recorded, or there may have been other anomalous circumstances
associated with it. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything
atypical can be found, outliers should be deleted from the data set and their
deletion noted in any reports about the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Outliers and skew distributions</p>
	<p>Deciding whether a value is an outlier or not is affected by the shape of
the distribution of values for the rest of the data.</p>

		<dt>Skew distribution</dt>
		<dd>A distribution with a long tail to one side is called a <strong>skew</strong> distribution
&mdash; positively skew if the long tail is to the right and negatively skew if the
long tail is to the left. It  is not unusual for the extreme value in a very
skew distribution to be a  fair distance from the other values and may not be
an outlier.</dd>
