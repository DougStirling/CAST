<p class=heading>Outliers
</p>

<p>Values that are considerably larger or smaller than the bulk of the data are 
called <strong>outliers</strong>.</p>

  <p>Detection of outliers is particularly important. An outlier may have been 
    incorrectly recorded, or there may have been other anomalous circumstances 
    associated with it. Outliers must be carefully checked if possible. If anything 
    atypical can be found, outliers should be deleted from the data set and their deletion noted in any reports about the data. </p>

<p>As part of a study of newborn calves at the author's university, a researcher 
      observed several births and recorded the time it took each calf to get onto 
      its feet after birth. The stem and leaf plot on the right displays these 
      times for <em>Friesian</em> calves. </p>
  
    <p>One calf took 8 hours to stand &mdash; more than double the time for any other 
      calf.</p>
	  <p>What was different about this calf? Further study showed that it had the 
      lowest birth weight of the calves, but it was healthy and did survive (unlike 
      some of the other calves in the study).</p></td>

  <p class="heading">Outliers and skew distributions</p>

  <p>An extreme data value that stands out from the rest of the data does not necessarily 
    indicate that there is a mistake in the data or something unusual about the 
    individual. Our interpretation of the extreme value should also take into 
    account the shape of the distribution of values for the rest of the data.</p>

    <dt>Symmetric distribution</dt>
  </dl>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/outlierSymmetric.gif" width="443" height="156"> 
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Skew distribution</dt>
    <dd>If the distribution of values has its peak at one side and a long tail 
      to the other side, the distribution is called <strong>skew</strong>. It 
      is not unusual for the extreme value in a very skew distribution to be a 
      fair distance from the other values.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/outlierSkew.gif" width="443" height="156"> 
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dd>If the tail is to the right we call this a right of positively skewed distribution. Similarly, if the tail is to the left the distribution is left (or negatively) skewed.</dd>

		<p class="heading">Storm duration</p>

		<p>The stem and leaf plot below shows the durations (in minutes) of the first 
			50 storms in the 1983/4 rainy season in the Bvumbwe catchment in Malawi.</p>
		<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/stormDurationStemLeaf.gif" width="255" height="260"> 
		</p>
		<p>One storm lasted much longer than the others (880 minutes). It is certainly 
			worth checking the records for this storm (was the duration perhaps really 
			88 minutes?). However the value is not necessarily a mistake.</p>
		<p>Most storms are short, with durations less than 100 minutes, so the longest 
			rows of leaves are at the bottom of the stem and leaf plot. There are fewer 
			storms lasting 100-200 minutes, fewer still of 200-300 minutes and this 
			pattern continues, with the frequency of storms decreasing steadily up the 
			stem and leaf plot. This shape of distribution is called a <strong>skew</strong> 
			distribution, as opposed to a <strong>symmetric</strong> distribution whose 
			tails decrease at similar speed on both sides of the peak density.</p>
<div class="centred">
<div class="boxed">
<p>Perhaps this 'outlier' is a continuation of the pattern into the tail of the distribution
and is just a long storm that could be <strong>expected</strong> once every hundred
or so storms.</p>
