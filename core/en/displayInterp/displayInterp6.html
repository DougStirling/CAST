<p class="heading">In small data sets, features of displays may not be meaningful</p>

<p>Be careful <strong>not to overinterpret</strong> patterns in small
data sets. Clusters, outliers or skewness may appear by chance even if there is
no meaningful basis to these features.
</p>
<div class="diagram" title="Illustration with random data">
	<p class="heading">Random data</p>

		<p>To investigate this further, we will examine some samples of 50 values 
			from a homogeneous process with <strong>no separate sub-groups or clusters</strong>. 
		</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="530" height="390">

		<p>The stem and leaf plot on the left above describes 50 values from this 
			process. Do you think that there are clusters or outliers?</p>
		<p>Click the button <strong>Another sample</strong> several times to examine 
			other samples. Even though the sample size is not particularly small, there 
			is surprising variability in the shape of the distribution. By chance, there 
			are occasionally gaps and occasionally values that are separated from the 
			others and appear to be outliers.</p>
		<p>Look at several samples and click <strong>Remember</strong> to retain the 
			data set that gives the greatest appearance of separating into two clusters. 
			Then do the same, retaining the data set that looks most likely to have 
			an outlier.</p>

<p>In this example, we know that these features in the samples

		<p class="heading">Steel Works Slag</p>
	<p>In steel works, iron ore is smelted to extract as much iron as possible, 
		but some iron remains in the waste from the process (slag) in the form of 
		iron oxide (FeO). The stem and leaf plot below shows the percentage of FeO in slag sampled 
		from 20 batches of iron ore.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="250" height="200">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="stemLeafProg.StemAndLeaf2Applet">
<param name="stemAxis" value="0 1 0 9 0 percent FeO">
<param name="varName" value="FeO in slag">
<param name="values" value="6.1 1.4 5.1 5.5 5.2 5.3 6.9 2.0 7.9 7.1 6.1 1.3 2.3 3.2 3.4 4.9 3.4 2.8 5.2 6.4">
<param name="discardDigits" value="0">
</applet>
</div>

	<p>The display seems to split into  two clusters. However without outside supporting evidence, you should not conclude that 
		a gap such as this <strong>must</strong> correspond 
		to a meaningful grouping of the iron ore batches into two clusters &mdash; the appearance of clusters may be caused only by the randomness of the data.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>If outliers or clusters are pronounced, they may be taken as indicative of
		something meaningful in the underlying process. However <strong>less pronounced
			outliers or clusters must be supported by outside evidence</strong> before these features
		can be interpreted as meaningful.</p>
