<p class="heading">Least squares</p>
<p>In practical situations, we must estimate β<sub>0</sub>,
β<sub>1</sub> and σ from a data set that we believe satisfies the normal linear model.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The best estimates of β<sub>0</sub> and β<sub>1</sub> are the slope and
intercept of the least squares line, <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub></p>
</div></div>

<p>Since<em> b</em><sub>0 </sub>and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> are functions of a
data set that we assume to be a random sample from the normal linear model, <em>b</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> are
themselves random quantities and have distributions.</p>
<p class="heading">Simulated example</p>
<p>The diagram below represents a regression model with a grey band. A sample
of 20 values has been generated from this model and the least squares line (shown
in blue) has been fitted to the simulated data. The least squares line provides
estimates of the slope and intercept but they are not exactly equal to the underlying
model values.</p>

<p>A different sample would give 20 different  points and a different least squares
line, so the least squares slope and intercept are random.</p>
