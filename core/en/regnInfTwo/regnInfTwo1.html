<p class="heading">Modelling randomness in linear models</p>
<p>For stimulus-response data sets, the least squares line provides a useful descriptive 
summary of the way that the explanatory variable is related to the response. However 
most such data sets are random &mdash; if data collection was repeated, different response 
values would be recorded &mdash; and the resulting least squares estimates are therefore 
also random. To properly interpret the values of the parameter estimates, you 
must understand their variability.</p>
<p>For data with a single explanatory variable, the randomness is modelled by 
assuming an underlying <strong>population</strong> regression line (whose intercept, 
β<sub>0</sub>, 
and slope, β<sub>1</sub>, 
are usually unknown values). The response is modelled as a normal random variable 
whose mean is given by this population regression line.</p>

<p>This model is often expressed in the equivalent form,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/normModelUni2.gif" width="359" height="21"></p>
<p class="heading">Normal linear model with two explanatory variables</p>
<p>The simple normal linear model can be easily extended to model data with two 
explanatory variables,</p>

<p class="eqn"><img src="images/normModelTwo.gif" width="257" height="21"></p>
<p>An equivalent way to write the model is:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/normModelTwo2.gif" width="418" height="21"></p>
  <p>The random part of the model, ε<sub><em>i</em></sub>, 
		is again called the model's <strong>error</strong> term.</p>
	<p class="heading">General linear model</p>
	<p>Both the simple linear model (with one explanatory variable) and this linear 
		model are special cases of the <strong>general linear model</strong> which 
		can have any number of explanatory variables,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/generalLinearModel.gif" width="522" height="23"></p>
	<p>We will mostly concentrate on models with two explanatory variables in this 
		chapter since they are easier to illustrate with 3-dimensional diagrams, but 
		it should be noted that all the concepts and methods can be generalised to 
		this wider class of models.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows a normal linear model that could possibly underlie 
the Body Fat data,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/bodyFatModel.gif" width="397" height="44"></p>
<p>The diagram initially shows a scatterplot of the two explanatory variables. 
The model treats the values of <em>Abdomen</em> and <em>Height</em> as fixed (non-random) 
for the 25 individuals.</p>

<p>Click the y-x-z button to rotate the diagram. The grey plane is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/bodyFatMeanEqn.gif" width="312" height="16"></p>
<p>For each individual a vertical red line has been drawn 2&sigma; 
on each side of the regression plane. The grey planes outlined on each side of 
the regression plane are also 2&sigma; above and below it.</p>
<p>Click on any such vertical line &mdash; the normal distribution of the response 
that is randomly generated by the model is displayed in blue.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to randomly generate sets of 
response measurements from this model.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Since about 95% of normal values are within 2&sigma; of their mean, about 95% of the generated crosses will be within the two outlined 
planes in the diagram.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Rotate the diagram to look end-on at the planes to verify that only about 5% 
of the crosses are outside the two outline planes.</p>
