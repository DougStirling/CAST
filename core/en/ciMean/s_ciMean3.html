<p class=heading>Interpretation of a confidence interval</p>
	<p>95% confidence intervals are found from sample data and are therefore random, so they do not always include the parameter that is being estimated.</p>
	<p>The diagram below is based on a simulation of random samples of <em>n</em> = 20 values from a normal population. The 95% confidence intervals for µ were calculated using the known population standard deviation, σ = 2.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_ciSim.gif" width="550" height="381"></p>
	<p>A few random samples resulted in CIs that did not include µ = 12 (the population mean used to generate the simulated samples). If we had continued the simulation with more samples, eventually 95% of the CIs would have included the true parameter value.</p>
	<p>In practice, we only have a single sample, and we do not know whether or not it is one of the 'lucky 95%' whose confidence intervals include µ, but we are <strong>95% confident</strong> that it is.</p>
	<p>Knowing that confidence intervals obtained in 
		this way will <strong>usually</strong> include it is very helpful. In practice,...</p>
