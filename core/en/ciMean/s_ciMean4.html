<p class="heading">Unknown population standard deviation</p>
	<p>If we know the value of the population standard deviation, σ, 
		an interval estimate of the form</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciMean/images/ci.gif" width="87" height="31"> </p>
	<p>has a confidence level of 0.95 &mdash; i.e. it is a 95% confidence interval.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In practice however, the value of σ 
					is rarely known.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>It is tempting to simply replace σ in the formula by its sample equivalent, <em>s</em>.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../ciMean/images/bad95CI.gif" width="86" height="31"> </p>
	<p>However replacing σ with <em>s</em> makes the confidence interval more variable and this means that it is less likely include µ &mdash; the confidence level is less than 95%. If the sample size, <em>n</em>, is large, the confidence level is close to 95%, but with smaller sample sizes the true confidence level can be much less than the target 95%. For example,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If <em>n</em> = 5, confidence intervals of this form only include µ in 88% of random samples, not 95%</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The confidence interval must be modified if σ is unknown.</p>
