<p class=heading>Interpretation of a confidence interval</p>
<p>In practice we only have a <strong>single</strong> sample (and a single confidence 
interval).</p>
  <p>We do not know whether or not this interval actually includes the unknown 
    population parameter. However knowing that confidence intervals obtained in 
    this way will <strong>usually</strong> include it is very helpful. In practice,...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Being right most of the time is the best one can hope for, 
since there is always the possibility of being misled by an unlucky sample.</p>
</div></div>


  <p class=heading>95% confidence level</p>
  <p>We use the scenario from the previous page (estimating a population mean, 
    µ, 
    from a sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, 
    when the population standard deviation, σ, 
    is known) to illustrate some general properties of confidence intervals.</p>
  <p>Since the sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, 
    varies from sample to sample, so does the 95% confidence interval that is 
    obtained from the sample &mdash; it too is a random quantity. </p>
  <p>Most samples will lead to confidence intervals that include µ, 
    but some will not. However the <strong>proportion</strong> of 95% confidence 
    intervals (obtained by repeated sampling from the same population) that include 
µ    is 0.95. </p>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration of confidence level"> 
<p class="heading">Simulation to demonstrate the confidence level</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a random sample from a normal population with µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;12 
and σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.</p>

<p>The 95% confidence interval is narrow when drawn on the same scale as the sample 
data, so click the checkbox <strong>Expanded summary scale</strong> to draw it 
on a more appropriate scale. </p>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to examine the interval estimates 
that would arise from different samples from this population. Click the checkbox 
<strong>Accumulate</strong> then take about 100 more samples. <span class="gray">(Hold down the <strong>Take sample</strong> button.)</span> You will probably observe 
that some intervals (drawn in red) do not include µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.</p>
<p class="gray">Click on intervals on the right to see the random samples 
from which they were obtained. Observe that the intervals that do not include 
12.0 come from samples whose individual values are not particularly extreme.</p>
<p>After about 200 samples, you should observe that approximately 95% of the interval 
estimates include the value 12.0. </p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In practice, only a <strong>single sample</strong> 
would be available. We cannot tell whether it is one of the 'lucky 95%' whose 
confidence intervals include µ, 
but we are <strong>95% confident</strong> that it is.</p>
