<p class=heading>Interpretation of a confidence interval</p>
	<p>In practice we only have a <strong>single</strong> sample (and a single confidence 
		interval). We do not know whether it actually includes the unknown population 
		mean, but knowing that confidence intervals obtained in this way will <strong>usually</strong> include µ 
		is very helpful. In practice,...</p>

<p>Being right most of the time is the best one can hope for, 
					since there is always the possibility of being misled by an unlucky sample.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The <strong>method</strong> that we use to obtain the confidence interval has 
		probability 0.95 of including µ. 
		We cannot tell whether the single interval that we evaluate from our data set 
		is one of these 'lucky' intervals, but knowing that the <strong>method</strong> works so often gives us <strong>95% confidence</strong> in it.</p>
