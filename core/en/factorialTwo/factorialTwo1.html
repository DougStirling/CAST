<p class="heading">Aim: understand the effect of <span class="red">two or more</span> factors</p>  
  <p>In the previous chapter, we considered experiments that were designed with a very simple aim &mdash; to assess the effect of a single factor on the response.</p>
  <p>Many experiments are conducted with broader aims and this chapter examines the design and analysis of experiments that are conducted with the aim of assessing the effects of two or more different factors.</p>
<ul>
      <li>An agricultural experiment may be designed to assess the effects of both nitrogen and phosphorous fertilisers on 
        crop yield.</li>
	  	<li>Biologists examining what attracts bees to flowers may want to understand how both the 
	  		shape and colour of an artificial flower  influence how many bees visit it.</li>
  	<li>Both temperature, pressure and presence of a catalyst may influence the purity 
	    of the output in a chemical reaction, so biochemists would want to examine the effect of all three factors.</li>
  </ul>
	<p>The most important concepts and methods can be explained and illustrated in experiments for <strong>two</strong> factors, so we will start  there.</p>
	<p class="heading">A poor experimental design</p>
	<p>If <em>n</em> experimental units are available for an experiment to assess the effect of two factors, A and B, on a response, the simplest experimental design  uses half of the experimental units in a completely randomised experiment to assess the effect of factor A and the other half in a <strong>separate experiment</strong> about factor B.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/separateExp.gif" width="241" height="241"></p>
	<p>Although this design initially seems reasonable, we will show in later pages of this section that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Important information about how A and B jointly affect the response cannot be estimated (interaction)</li>
		<li>The design is inefficient &mdash; estimates of the effects of A and B are unnecessarily inaccurate.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="heading">Completely randomised design for both factors</p>
	<p>A better design uses all experimental units in a single completely randomised design in which the levels of A and B are both varied.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/combinedExp.gif" width="241" height="241"></p>
	<p>Each different combination of a level of A and a level of B is called a <strong>treatment</strong>. In a completely randomised design, we normally use equal replicates of all possible treatments.</p>
	<p>As in completely randomised experiments with a single factor, the different treatments are randomly allocated to the experimental units.</p>
	<p>This type of design is called a <strong>factorial design</strong> for the two factors.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the random allocation of treatments to experimental units for an experiment in which:</p>
<ul>
	<li>factor A has two levels (A1 and A2)</li>
	<li>factor B has three levels (B1, B2 and B3)</li>
	<li>there are four relicates for each of the six treatments</li>
</ul>
<p>The diagram lists all treatments on the left.</p>
