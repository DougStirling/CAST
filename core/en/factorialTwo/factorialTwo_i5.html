<p class="heading">Independently adjustable factors</p>  
  <p>The two-factor analyses that we have described in this section require an 
		equal number of replicates at all combinations of levels of the two factors. 
		This means that we must be able to <strong>independently control the levels 
		of both factors</strong>.</p>
	<p>In some experiments, it is possible to identify two factors that we believe 
		will affect the response (e.g. temperature and humidity in a warehouse affect 
		deterioration of a product). However it may be impossible in practice to independently 
		adjust both factors in the warehouse &mdash; increasing temperature <strong>causes</strong> 
		a change in humidity but humidity cannot be changed directly.</p>
	<p>Despite our identification of two factors, only one can be directly adjusted 
		so we could only conduct a 1-factor experiment in the warehouse. This would 
		not allow separation of the effects of the two underlying factors.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In a laboratory however, it may be possible to 
				independently alter both factors, allowing separate assessment of their 
				effects.</p>
</div></div>

	
		
	<p class="heading">Mixtures</p>
	<p>An extreme example of this practical restriction occurs when a product contains 
		a mixture of two constituents, A and B. The quality of the product depends 
		on both constituents, but the proportion of B is one minus the proportion 
		of A, so they are directly related.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>For a mixture of two constituents, only a one-factor 
				experiment is possible.</p>
</div></div>

	
		
	<p class="heading">Imprecisely controlled factor levels</p>
	<p>A further practical problem with conducting factorial experiments arises 
		when the control of one or more factors is separated from the actual numerical 
		value of the factor. For example, we can attempt to control the temperature 
		in a warehouse with a thermostat, but outside temperature may result in actual 
		temperatures in parts of the warehouse that differ from the thermostat setting.</p>
	<p>In the experiment, we may decide to use three different temperatures (levels 
		of this factor), but the actual warehouse temperatures may differ between 
		runs of the experiment &mdash; close but not exactly equal to the three target 
		temperatures.</p>
	<p>If the actual temperatures are recorded, they should be used as explanatory 
		variables instead of the target factor levels. However the analysis is more 
		complicated than the methods that have been described in this section.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We do not offer solutions to this problem here, 
				but simply alert the reader to the need for a different analysis.</p>
</div></div>
