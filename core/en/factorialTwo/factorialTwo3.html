<p class="heading">Interaction</p>
  <p>One important reason for assessing the effects of two factors in a factorial experiment is that it allows you to assess whether the factors <strong>interact</strong> in their effect on the response. <strong>Interaction</strong> occurs when the effect of changing the level of one factor is different for different levels of the second factor.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>The effect on a crop's yield  of increasing irrigation may depend on the variety used &mdash; some varieties may respond better to irrigation than others.</li>
 		<li>The effect on weight gain of cows caused by giving a food supplement  may be different for young and old cows &mdash; the supplement may be of little benefit to old cows.</li>
  	<li>A fungacide is applied to apple trees after pruning. Its effect on the size of apples in the following year may depend on how heavily the trees were pruned &mdash; heavily pruned trees may get more benefit from the fungacide.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In separate experiments for the two factors, we do not have information about the effects of factor A at different levels of factor B, so we cannot assess 
 	whether there is interaction.</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A factorial design is needed to look for 
				interaction.</p>
</div></div>

	
		
<p>Summarising the results of experiments is usually easier if there is no interaction between the factors. However if interaction exists, it is important that it is discovered and described. Interaction will be described more fully in a later section of this chapter.</p>

<p class="heading">Texture of a dairy product</p>

<p>Consider an experiment in which the main aim is to assess how the texture of a dairy product deteriorates between 1 day and 2 weeks after manufacture. It is also known that the storage temperature affects deterioration, so the experiment will attempt to discover the effects of both factors on texture.</p>

<p>The diagram above initially shows typical results from a factorial experiment for storage time and temperature. The values on the right are  differences between the mean texture at 1 day and 2 weeks. They are shown separately for the samples stored at low temperature, at high temperature and overall.</p>
<p>If there is no interaction between the factors, the decrease in texture between 1 day and 2 weeks should be approximately the same whatever the storage temperature. The actual data show a decrease in mean texture of about 3 at 10°C but  about 11.5  at 20°C.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>There is interaction &mdash; the decrease in texture (from 1 day to 2 weeks) is greater at high than low temperature.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Now consider the results that would have been obtained if two separate experiments had been conducted, one to assess the effect of temperature on texture and the other to assess the effect of storate time. Select<strong> Experiment for storage</strong> from the pop-up menu to see typical results from an experiment conducted at 10°C to assess the effect of storage time. From it and the corresponding experiment for temperature:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>We would have no idea that the combination of high temperature and long storage time is particularly bad. </p>
</div></div>
<p>Since there is interaction:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p><strong>A single value is not enough</strong> to describe how texture decreases between storage of 1 day and 2 weeks.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Because of the interaction between temperature and storage time,  we must separately report the mean decreases at both 10°C and  20°C to fully describe how storage time affects texture.</p>
