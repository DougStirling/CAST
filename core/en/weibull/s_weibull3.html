<p>Probabilities for the Weibull distribution are usually found from the cumulative distribution function.</p>
<div class="theoremProof">
	<div class="theorem">
		<p class="theoremTitle">Cumulative distribution function</p>
		<p>If \(X \sim \WeibullDistn(\alpha, \lambda)\) its cumulative distribution function is</p>
		\[
		F(x) \;\;=\;\; P(X \le x) \;\;=\;\; 1 - e^{-(\lambda x)^{\alpha}} \]

<p>Given values of \(x\), \(\alpha\) and \(\lambda\), these probabilities can be evaluated on a scientific calculator. Excel also has a function to evaluate cumulative Weibull probabilities, but its third parameter is the inverse of \(\lambda\), rather than \(\lambda\) itself. The cumulative probability could be found by typing into a spreadsheet cell</p>
<p class="eqn">=WEIBULL.DIST( \(x\),  \(\alpha\),   \(1/\lambda\),  true )</p>
<p>Although the parameter \(\alpha\) has a meaningful interpretation since \(h(x) \propto x^{\alpha - 1}\), the value of the parameter \(\lambda\) is <strong>not</strong> easily interpreted. The <strong>mean</strong> lifetime of the items is an easier value to interpret than  \(\lambda\) itself,</p>
\[
E[X] \;=\; \frac 1 {\lambda} \Gamma\left(1 + \frac 1 {\alpha}\right)
\]
<div class="questionSoln">
	<div class="question">
		<p class="questionTitle">Question</p>
		<p>If an item's hazard rate is proportional to the square root of its age, and its mean lifetime is 3 years, what is the probability that it will survive for longer than 10 years?</p>

</div>
<p>We now give an example in which the hazard rate <strong>decreases</strong> over time.</p>
<div class="questionSoln">
	<div class="question">
		<p class="questionTitle">Question</p>
		<p>If the item's hazard rate was <strong>inversely </strong>proportional to the square root of its age, and its mean lifetime is 3 years, what would be the corresponding probability of surviving for longer than 10 years? 40 years?</p>
