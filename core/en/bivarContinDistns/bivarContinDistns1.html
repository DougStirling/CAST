<p class="heading">Probabilities as volumes</p>

<p>We <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('continuousDistns1')">showed earlier</a> that there is zero probability of a univariate continuous random variable, \(X\), taking any specific value, \(x\),</p>
\[
		P(X=x) \;=\; 0 \qquad \text{for all } x
		\]
<p>For a similar reason, there is zero probability associated with  specific values for a pair of two continuous random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\),</p>
\[
P(X=x \textbf{ and } Y=y) \;=\; 0 \qquad \text{for all } x,y
\]
<p>Events of interest correspond to <strong>ranges</strong> of values of the variables, such as</p>
\[
P(1 \lt X \lt 2 \textbf{ and } Y \gt 4)
\]
<p>For univariate continuous distributions, probabilities are found as areas under a probability density function,</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/univarProb.png" width="331" height="244"></p>
<p>Probabilities for bivariate continuous distributions are defined in an analogous way, but as <strong>volumes under a surface</strong> in three dimensions. In the illustration below, the surface has unit height for all values of \(x\) and \(y\) between 0 and 1 (and zero height elsewhere). The shaded volume is the probability that \((X+Y)\) has a value greater than 1 and can be found by simple geometry to be &frac12;.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/bivarProb.png" width="300" height="277"></p>
<p class="heading">Joint probability density function</p>
<p>The shape of the surface defines the joint distribution of the two variables. This surface is called the variables' <strong>joint probability density function</strong>. It is often denoted by \(f(x,y)\) and defined by a mathematical formula.</p>
<p>In order to be the joint probability density function of two continuous random variables, a function \(f(x, y)\) must satisfy two properties.</p>
<div class="theoremProof">
	<div class="theorem">
		<p class="theoremTitle">Properties of probability functions</p>
		\[
		f(x,y) \ge 0 \text{ for all } x, y
		\]
		\[
		\iint\limits_{\text{all } x,y} f(x,y)\;dx\;dy = 1
		\]
	</div>
</div>
<p>The second requirement corresponds to the <strong>total volume</strong> under the joint probability density function being one. This is required because</p>

\[
P(-\infty \lt X \lt \infty \textbf{ and } -\infty \lt Y \lt \infty)
\]
<p>must be one since \(X\) and \(Y\) are certain to have values within these ranges.</p>
