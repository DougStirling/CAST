<p>Discrete distributions are often summarised by their mean and variance. The mean and variance of a continuous distribution are similar concepts, but must be defined in a different way.</p>
<p class="heading">Mean</p>

<p>We defined the mean of a discrete random variable to be</p>
\[
E[X] \;=\; \mu \;=\; \sum_{\text{all } x} {x \times p(x)}
\]
<p>Consider a histogram of a continuous random variable, \(X\), with the histogram classes centred on \(x_1, x_2, \dots\).</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/mean1.png" width="393" height="244"></p>
<p>If the values in each histogram class were at the midpoint of their classes, the corresponding definition of the mean would be</p>
\[
E[X] \;\approx\; \sum_{i} {x_i \times p(\text{class }i)}
\]
<p>Making the classes narrower would refine the  definition:</p>
<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="images/mean2.png" width="393" height="244"></p>
<p>The mean of the continuous random variable is the limit of this, as the classes are made narrower and narrower.</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<p>We will <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_continuousMeanVar')">formally define the mean</a> as an integral later in the e-book.</p></div>

<p class="heading">Variance</p>
<p>The variance of a discrete random variable is</p>
\[
\Var (X) \;=\; \sigma^2 \;=\; E \left[(X - \mu)^2 \right] \;=\; \sum_x (x - \mu)^2 \;p(x)
\]
<p>The corresponding variance of a continuous random variable is what would be obtained in a similar way as a limit of those from the discrete histograms above,  with classes getting narrower and narrower.</p>
