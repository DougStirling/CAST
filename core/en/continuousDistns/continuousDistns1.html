<p class="heading">Discrete random variables</p>

<p>A discrete random variable is a numerical variable with either a finite or a countably infinite number of possible values. Usually these values are <strong>counts</strong> of something — integers. For example,</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Number of boys in a family of four children</dt>
	<dd>The possible values are {0, 1, 2, 3 and 4}.</dd>
	<dt>Number of times a switch is used before it fails</dt>
	<dd>The possible values are {1, 2, ...} with no upper limit.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">Continuous random variables</p>
<p>In contrast, a continuous random variable can take any value within some range. For example,</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Weight of a potato</dt>
	<dd>This might be any value between 100g and 400g. You might dispute these values for the minimum and maximum weights, but any real values are possible within some range.</dd>
	<dt>Maximum July temperature in Oxford</dt>
	<dd>Any value between 10ºC and 35ºC would be possible, though values between 20º and 30º would be most likely</dd>
</dl>
<p>It can be argued that <strong>recorded</strong> values are always rounded to some number of decimals, making the number of possible <strong>recorded</strong> values of these variables finite, but the <strong>underlying</strong> measurement is continuous with an uncountable number of possible values.</p>
<p class="heading">Probabilities for individual values</p>
<p>The randomness of discrete random variables can be described with the probabilities of all possible values — either with a table of probabilities or a mathematical function. This is not possible for continuous random variables since all individual values have effectively zero probability.</p>

<div class="theoremProof">
	<div class="theorem">
		<p class="theoremTitle">Probability for a specific value of X</p>
		<p>If a random variable, \(X\), has a continuous distribution,</p>
		\[
		P(X=x) \;=\; 0 \qquad \text{for all } x
		\]</div>
	<div class="proof">
		<p>We only explain this informally. Consider the following sequence of probabilities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>\(P(x - 0.01 \lt X \lt x + 0.01)\)</li>
			<li>\(P(x - 0.001 \lt X \lt x + 0.001)\)</li>
			<li>\(P(x - 0.0001 \lt X \lt x + 0.0001)\)</li>
			<li>\(P(x - 0.00001 \lt X \lt x + 0.00001)\)</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The probabilities that \(X\) would equal \(x\)  to \(k\) decimal places will clearly decrease as \(k\) increases. In the limit, the probability that \(X\) equals \(x\)  to an <strong>infinite</strong> number of decimals is infinitesimally small — effectively zero.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>We will still use probabilities to describe the distribution of a continuous random variable, but  must find a way to describe the probabilities for <strong>events</strong>, such as \((2 \lt X \lt 3)\), not individual outcomes such as \((X = 2.5)\).</p>

<p class="heading">Probability density functions</p>
<p>A continuous random variable's distribution is characterised by a function called a <strong>probability density function</strong> that is closely related to the histogram of a data set.</p>


<div class="example" title="Illustration: Histrograms with narrow classes">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Reducing histogram class width</p>
	<p>In conventional histograms of data sets with equal class widths, the height of each class's rectangle is given by the proportion of values in that class. A similar histogram can be drawn for a continuous random variable, but with the rectangle's height being given determined by the <strong>probability</strong> of a value being in the class.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="400" height="260">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="samplingProg.RandomHistoApplet">
<param name="backgroundColor" value="FFFBF3">
<param name="varName" value="values">
<param name="parameters" value="4.5 0.8#6.5 1.1#0.7">
<param name="sampling" value="-1 72309328">

</applet>
</div>

	<p>Click <strong>Narrower</strong> several times to reduce the width of the histogram classes. For a histogram of a finite data set, reducing the class width generally makes the contour of the histogram more jagged, but with a continuous distribution, the shape approaches a smooth curve.</p>
</div>

<p>With infinitely narrow histogram class widths, a continuous distribution's histogram is called its <strong>probability density function</strong>,  often abbreviated to the distribution's <strong>pdf</strong>. (This is scaled to have area one.)</p>

<p>A random variable's probability density function is often described by a mathematical function,</p>
\[f(x)\]
<p>We will fully describe the properties of probability density functions in a later chapter. In the remainder of this section, we informally introduce some of the ideas.</p>
