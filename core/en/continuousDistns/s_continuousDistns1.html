<dl>
	<dt>Discrete random variable</dt>
	<dd>This is a numerical variable with either a finite or a countably infinite number of possible values â€” usually <strong>counts</strong> of something.</dd>
	<dt>Continuous random variable</dt>
	<dd>Its values can be <strong>anywhere</strong> in some range, such as a weight or distance.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Although <strong>recorded</strong> values of a continuous variable are always rounded to some number of decimals, making the number of possible <strong>recorded</strong> values of these variables finite,  the <strong>underlying</strong> measurement has an uncountable number of possible values.</p>
<p class="heading">Probabilities for individual values</p>
<p>For continuous random variables, all individual values have effectively zero probability.</p>
<div class="theoremProof">
	<div class="theorem">
		<p class="theoremTitle">Probability for a specific value of X</p>
		<p>If a random variable, \(X\), has a continuous distribution,</p>
		\[
		P(X=x) \;=\; 0 \qquad \text{for all } x
		\]

<p>Probabilities are still used to describe the distribution, but  we need to find a way to describe the probabilities for <strong>events</strong>, such as \((2 \lt X \lt 3)\), not individual outcomes such as \((X = 2.5)\).</p>
<p class="heading">Probability density functions</p>
<p>A  <strong>probability density function</strong> (<strong>pdf</strong>) is used to describe a continuous random variable's distribution. It is closely related to a histogram, but with infinitely narrow histogram classes.(It is scaled to have area one.)</p>

<p>A random variable's probability density function is usually a smooth function and is often described by a mathematical function,</p>
\[f(x)\]
<p>The properties of probability density functions are fully described in a later chapter. At this stage, we just informally introduce some of the ideas.</p>
