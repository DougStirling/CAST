<p><strong>Normal </strong>distributions are particularly important in statistics. A particular  distribution from this family is specified by the values of two  <strong>parameters</strong>,  usually denoted by \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\).</p>
\[
X \;\; \sim \; \; \NormalDistn(\mu,\; \sigma^2)
\]
<p>Confusingly, the second parameter of the normal distribution is sometimes written  &quot;\(\sigma\)&quot; instead of &quot;\(\sigma^2\)&quot;. We will try to be explicit about whether \(\sigma\) or \(\sigma^2\) is intended, such as</p>
\[
X \;\; \sim \; \; \NormalDistn(\mu=12,\; \sigma^2=5)
\]
<p class="heading">Shape of a normal distribution</p>
<p>A normal distribution's pdf has a relatively complex formula,</p>
\[
f(x) = \frac 1 {\sqrt{2\pi}\;\sigma} e^{\large -\frac 1{2\sigma^2} (x-\mu)^2 } \quad\quad \text{for } -\infty \lt x \lt +\infty
\]
<p>The normal distribution's pdf will be treated mathematically later in the e-book.</p>
<p>At this point, we simply state some  of its properties without proof. Its shape is determined by the values of the two parameters,  \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\):</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Symmetry</dt>
	<dd>All normal distributions are symmetric with their maximum pdf  at \(\mu\).</dd>
	<dt>Mean and median</dt>
	<dd>For any symmetric distribution, both the mean and median are at the point of symmetry. This holds for normal distributions so, in particular,</dd>
\[E[X] = \mu\]
	<dt>Variance</dt>
	<dd>The variance of the normal distribution is</dd>
\[\Var(X) = \sigma^2\]
	<dt>Shape</dt>
	<dd>Other than their centre and spread of values, all normal distributions have pdfs with the same basic shape. Many authors call this &quot;bell-shaped&quot; though the peak at \(\mu\) is sharper than most bells!</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some of these results will be proved later.</p>
