<p class="heading">Comparing groups</p>
<p>Dot plots and stem and leaf plots retain a lot of detailed information about 
the individual values in a data set. Although this detailed information may be 
useful when examining the distribution of values in a single data set, it is distracting 
when two or more groups are being compared.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Too much detail can attract attention away from the <strong>main</strong> 
differences between the groups.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We usually want to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which groups tend to have highest and lowest values?</li>
<li>How variable are the values in the groups?</li>
<li>How much overlap exists between the distributions in the different groups?</li>
</ul>
<p>Dot plots and stem and leaf plots do contain the answers to these questions, 
but the information does not 'jump out at you'. Histograms and frequency polygons are better for making 
comparisons since they hide the detailed information about individual values, 
but many data sets can be effectively summarised much further.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Rice yields</p>
<p>The jittered dot plots below show the rice yields (tonnes per hectare) in 2012 
from the major rice-producing countries of the world. </p>


<form>
<select name="dataset" onChange="changeImage('image', this)">
<option value="0" selected>Jittered dot plots</option>
<option value="1">Stacked dot plots</option>
<option value="2">Histograms</option>
</select>
</form>

</p>

<p>Use the pop-up menu to compare the regions with stacked dot plots and histograms. 
The main information from the displays is:</p>

<ul>
  		<li>The wide spread of rice yields in Africa with most countries having very low yields, but a few having very high yields (in particular, Egypt and Morocco).</li>
  		
<li>Relatively high rice yields in Europe and North America.</li>
  		
<li>A skew distribution of rice yields in India and East Asia (including Australia) with many countries having yields of 3 to 4, but a few with much higher yields.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the main differences are easily seen, the eye
is also distracted by other irregularities in the displays.
</p>

</div>

<p>The remainder of this section describes a new way to  summarise the distribution of values in a data set. This graphical summary concisely captures much of the 'important' features of the distribution and is particularly effective for comparing two or more groups of values.</p>
