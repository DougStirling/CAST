<p class="heading notPrinted">Chartjunk</p>
	<p><span style="float:right; padding:10px"><img class="gif" src="images/simpleBarchart.gif" width="162" height="147"></span>Bar charts can be very simple and need not take up much space in reports. Avoid the temptation to embellish them 'artistically' to make them more 
		visually appealing. These additions are collectively called <strong>chartjunk</strong>.</p>
	<p>Chartjunk adds 'noise' to a bar chart and  makes it harder to read
the real information that is contains. Rather than adding chartjunk, draw it
small or replace it with a frequency table.</p>
<p>A common form of chartjunk arises when each bar is drawn as a 3-dimensional
 object. When the resulting 3-dimensional picture is rotated, it often becomes
 harder to compare the heights of bars and to read off values from the axes.
In  particular, <strong>perspective views should be avoided</strong>.</p>

<p class="heading">Replacing bars with objects</p>
	<p>A more serious problem arises when the rectangular bars in a barchart are
replaced with pictures of objects. This often visually mis-represents the proportions
in the different categories &mdash; the visual importance of a bar is determined by
its area or volume, not its height.</p>
