<p class="heading">Bar charts for quantities</p>
	<p>Bar charts are most often used to show frequencies for discrete or categorical
 data but they can be used to display any <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('transform3')">quantity
 data</a>. (Quantity data are 'amounts' of something and are always positive.
They are  also called <strong>ratio variables</strong>.)</p>

<p class="heading">Pie charts for quantities</p>
	<p>Pie charts can also be used to display quantity data, but there is an additional 
		requirement that must be satisfied before a pie chart is used. <strong>The total 
			of all the data that are displayed must itself be meaningful</strong>.</p>
	<p>In the published pie chart below, the individual values are death rates per 100,000 live births, so their total is meaningless. A pie chart therefore <strong>should  not have been used</strong>.</p>
