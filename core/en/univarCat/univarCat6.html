<p class="heading">Chartjunk</p>
  
<p>As with bar charts, pie charts are often graphical representations of a small 
number of values. For example, a pie chart of the gender of students in a class 
is only based on a single value, the proportion of males. As a result, there is 
a temptation to 'enhance' pie charts as 3-dimensional objects &mdash; chartjunk.</p>
<p>Resist the temptation &mdash; it does not make the data any easier to understand 
and may indeed be misleading since 3-dimensional pie charts can over-emphasise 
the categories closest to the viewer.</p>

<p class="heading">Kestrel deaths</p>

<p>The 3-dimensional pie chart below shows causes of death of kestrels in Britain 
between 1963 and 1997. </p>

<p>The viewpoint tends to make the closest categories appear too large. In particular, 
<em>Disease</em> incorrectly appears to be as common a cause of death as <em>Unknown</em>. 
(There were 77 deaths caused by <em>Disease</em> and 114 of <em>Unknown</em> cause.)</p>

<p class="heading">Small is beautiful</p>

<p>In general, it is better to draw a standard pie chart smaller rather than embellishing 
it with chartjunk.</p>

<p class="heading">Births and partners</p>

<p>The 'exploded' pie chart below describes whether American women aged 15-39 were living with their husband, a partner or were not cohabitating when they had children in 2010. The data were collected in the 2010 Current Population Survey in the USA.</p>

<p>The simpler small pie chart below shows the data more clearly. </p>
