<p class="heading notPrinted">Moving average with odd and even run lengths</p>
	<p>A moving average provides a smoothed value at the middle of the times of the values being averaged.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/movingAverage5.gif" width="249" height="218">          <img class="gif" src="images/movingAverage4.gif" width="237" height="218"></p>
	<p>If averaging over an even number of values, the smoothed value is for a time between those of the data values, such as &quot;year 2005.5&quot;.</p>
	<p class="heading">A second stage of averaging for even run lengths</p>
	<p>To provide smoothed values at the same times as the raw data, we often take a further 2-point moving average.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/movingAverageDouble.gif" width="428" height="218"> </p>
	<p>This is equivalent to giving <strong>half weight</strong> to the two outermost values. If  based on moving averages of 4, this is called a 4-point centred moving average.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>These centred averages are particularly useful when analysing seasonal data. For example, 12-point centred moving averages are often used for monthly data.</p>
