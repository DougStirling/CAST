<p class="heading">Outliers and running medians</p>
	<p>Since medians are less sensitive to outliers than means, a more robust alternative to running means replaces each value by the <strong>median</strong> of it and adjacent values. A <strong>3-point running median</strong> is: </p>

	<p>and higher-order running medians will use more adjacent values. </p>
	<p class="heading">Comparison of means and medians</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Moving averages are more affected by outliers in the series</li>
		<li>Running medians often have a 'stepped' appearance &mdash; the smoothed series 
			is level for periods, followed by relatively sharp jumps.</li>
	</ul>

<p class=heading>Running medians, followed by moving averages</p>
<p>To take advantage of the best features of both moving averages and running 
		medians, these two techniques are often applied sequentially.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Firstly, low-order running medians are used to remove the influence of outliers.</li>
		<li>The resulting series is then further smoothed with low-order moving averages.</li>
	</ul>
