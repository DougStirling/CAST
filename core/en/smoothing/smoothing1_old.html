<p class="heading">Moving averages</p>
	<p>In a time series, random fluctuations can usually be treated as <strong>noise</strong> that can obscure trend and other <strong>signal</strong> in the series. Various <strong>smoothing methods</strong> have been proposed to reduce these random fluctuations and show 
    the systematic movement in the series more clearly. These methods replace each value in the series with 
  a function of it and the adjacent values. </p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="black"><strong>smoothed value</strong> &nbsp; = &nbsp;<em><strong>centre</strong></em> ( <strong>original value</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>adjacent values</strong> )</span>
</p>

  <p>For example, each value might be replaced by the mean of it and the two adjacent 
    values, replacing the value at time <i>i</i> by </p>

</p>

  <p>This smoothed fit is called a <strong>3-point moving average</strong>. Moving 
		averages are also called <strong>running means</strong>. Greater smoothing 
		is obtained with means of more adjacent values. For example, a 7-point 
		moving average replaces each value with the mean of it and the 3 adjacent 
		values on each side.</p>
    
	<p class="heading">Ends of the series</p>
	<p>Moving averages are effective at highlighting the trend in the centre of 
    a time series, but cannot be used at the ends since the moving average requires 
    values both <strong>before and after</strong> each value being smoothed. As 
    the amount of smoothing increases, the number of unsmoothed values at the 
    ends of the series also increases. For example, if 7-point moving averages 
    are used, 3 values at each end of the series cannot be smoothed.</p>

<p class="heading">Southern Oscillation</p>

		<p>The Southern Oscillation Index is defined as the barometric pressure difference between Tahiti and the Darwin Islands at sea level. The southern oscillation is a predictor of El Nino which in turn is thought to be a driver of world-wide weather. Specifically, repeated southern oscillation values less than -1 typically defines an El Nino. The time series plot shows the index between January 1984 and December 1992.</p>
