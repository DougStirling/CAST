<p class="heading">Statistics and simple questions</p>

<p>Students are usually taught statistics in the context of well-defined questions. 
For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>In a particular hospital, are waiting lists getting longer?</li>
<li>Does an ultrasonic sound generator repel mice?</li>
</ul>
  <p>Students are usually presented with relevant data and asked to draw a conclusion. 
    Although it is important to master the statistical techniques to extract information 
    from pre-collected data,</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The use of statistics in the real world is rarely so 
          simple.</p>
</div></div>

  <p class="heading">Statistics for complex problems</p>
  <p>In practice, problems are rarely so well-defined and there may be various 
    different ways to collect data to throw light on them.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we reduce hospital waiting lists?</li>
<li>How do you design an ultrasonic sound generator to repel mice?</li>
</ul>
<p>Collection and analysis of data to help attack the problem usually suggest 
further questions for which further data are required. Several cycles of data 
collection and analysis are usually needed, with considerable input from an expert 
in the problem area between each cycle of the process. </p>

<p class="heading">Continuous quality improvement</p>
<p>One important example of this type of continuing process arises in business 
	and industrial contexts where statistics is an important part of the long-term 
	<strong>monitoring</strong> of performance. The process may simply monitor 
	existing systems to ensure that they continue to perform at their current 
	levels, or the aim may be to <strong>improve</strong> aspects of the system. 
	The latter is often called <strong>continuous quality improvement</strong> 
	or <strong>total quality management</strong>.</p>
<p class="heading">Detecting problems</p>
<p>Problems in a process are usually detected by collecting and analysing <strong>data</strong> 
	about the performance of the system. Various different types of data can be 
	collected to throw light on the performance of a system. In this section, 
	we describe one particularly useful way to monitor processes. </p>
