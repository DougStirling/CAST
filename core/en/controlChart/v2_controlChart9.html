<p class="heading">Finding the <span class="red">cause</span> of problems</p>
  <p>Control charts (and other collected data) may indicate problems with a system. 
    For example, </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A clothing retailer discovers that sales have decreased over the previous 
      year.</li>
    <li>A manufacturer of plastic boxes finds that a sizeable proportion have 
      defects.</li>
    <li>An ecologist finds that sightings of a native bird have decreased in the 
      previous year.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, after detection of a problem, its <strong>cause</strong> must be 
    identified in order to rectify it. This is usually a non-trivial exercise 
    and the following tools often help.</p>
  <div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">Brainstorming</p>
<p>Continuous quality improvement is usually performed by a team, and a good
way to get ideas is with a <strong>brainstorming</strong> session.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'controlChart', 'brainstorm', '500', '332');</script>

<p class="heading">Cause-and-effect diagrams</p>
<p>After possible causes for a problem have been contributed in a brainstorming
session, they can be structured in a <strong>cause-and-effect</strong> diagram.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'controlChart', 'fishbone', '500', '392');</script>

<p>Because of the shape of this diagram, it is often called a <strong>fishbone</strong> 
diagram.</p>

</div>

<p>This structuring of possible causes helps to focus attention on the most likely 
causes and on ones that may be altered in the 'Do' step in the Plan-Do-Check-Act 
cycle. </p>
