<p class="heading">Control limits</p>

<p>The simplest rule suggesting a special cause is any value that is outside
two <strong>control limits</strong>. The values 2000&nbsp;ml and 2080&nbsp;ml
on the run chart in the previous page might be used as control limits. More extreme
values in the process suggest that it is <strong>out of control</strong> &mdash;
they <strong>trigger</strong> an examination of the process for a special cause.
</p>

<p>Since control limits on a run chart are used to trigger an examination of the 
  production process &mdash; possibly a costly exercise &mdash; we must set them wide enough 
  that they are rarely exceeded when the process is stable. </p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Accuracy of the 70-95-100 rule of thumb</p>

<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb implies that values should rarely be more than
3 standard deviations from the mean if the process is in control.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'controlChart', 'ruleOfThumb', '446', '222');</script>


</div>

<p>Although the actual proportion of values outside the <i>mean ± 3 st 
  devn</i> control limits depends on the shape of the distribution, it is a rare 
  occurrence for all distributions when the process is under control. However:</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Control limits at ±&nbsp;3 standard deviations 
        from the process mean should be avoided for very skew distributions.</p>
</div></div>


<p>If the measurements are very skew, consider transforming the data before producing 
  a run chart.</p>
