<p class="heading">Control limits</p>
	<p>The simplest rule suggesting a special cause is any value that is outside
		two <strong>control limits</strong>. Values outside the control limits suggest
that the process is <strong>out of control</strong> &mdash;
		they <strong>trigger</strong> an examination of the process for a special cause. </p>
	<p>Control limits are usually based on the mean and standard deviation of the 
		process when it is in control. The 70-95-100 rule of thumb states that in many 
		distributions, </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Approximately two thirds of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
		<li>Approximately 95% of the values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
		<li>Nearly all of the values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/bands.gif" width="578" height="264"></p>
	<p>By setting the upper and lower control limits to be 3 standard deviations
		on either side of the process mean, we avoid many 'false alarms' when the process is
		in control. This is important since values outside the control limits would trigger an examination of the 
		production process &mdash; possibly a costly exercise.</p>
	<p class="heading">Shape of the distribution</p>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule of thumb is most accurate for reasonably symmetric, bell-shaped distributions, though values more than 3 standard deviations from the mean are rare for all distributions. However these control limits should be avoided for very skew distributions &mdash; consider transforming  the data before producing 
	a run chart.</p>
