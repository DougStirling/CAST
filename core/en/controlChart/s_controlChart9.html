<p class="heading notPrinted">Finding the <span class="red">cause</span> of problems</p>
	<p>Control charts (and other collected data) may indicate problems with a system. 
		However, after detection of a problem, its <strong>cause</strong> must be 
		identified in order to rectify it. This is usually a non-trivial exercise 
		and the following tools often help.</p>
<p class="heading">Brainstorming</p>
	<p>In a <strong>brainstorming</strong> session, all team 
		members contribute short phrases that are written on either a large sheet of paper 
		or individual scraps of paper (post-it notes are good). The points should be written 
		down without discussion or editing, and all team members should be encouraged 
		to contribute.</p>
	<p>Once these ideas have been written down, they must be structured or grouped 
		in some way.</p>
	<p class="heading">Cause-and-effect diagrams</p>
	<p>After possible causes for a problem have been contributed in a brainstorming 
		session, they can be structured in a <strong>cause-and-effect</strong> diagram (also called  a <strong>fishbone</strong> diagram).</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/fishbone4.gif" width="484" height="377" class="summaryPict"></p>
<p>This structuring of possible causes helps to focus attention on the most likely 
		causes and on ones that may be altered in the 'Do' step in the Plan-Do-Check-Act 
		cycle.</p>
