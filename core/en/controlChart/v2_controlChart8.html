<p class="heading">Detecting changes to process variability</p>

<p>A control chart of sample means is used to detect shifts in the 'centre' of 
  a process. In a similar way, a control chart to assess whether the process <strong>variability</strong> 
  has changed can be based on the spread of successive samples. </p>

<p>A control chart for changes in process variability can be based on the <strong>sample
standard deviations</strong> of successive samples, but it is more
common in practice to use a control chart based on the <strong>sample ranges</strong>.

</div>

<p>By separately targetting the process centre and variability with a control chart for means
and a control chart for ranges, we can get better indications of any changes in the performance
of the process, and we can therefore intervene more promptly to correct potential drops
in quality.
