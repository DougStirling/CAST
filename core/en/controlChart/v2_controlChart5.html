<p class="heading">False alarms </p>

<p>Although the individual patterns that we use as triggers occur rarely in a process
that is in control, they do occur occasionally. Indeed, the proportion of values
from a stable process that triggers each of the
criteria is typically about 1 in 200, so if all five criteria are used, a reasonable
number of <strong>false alarms</strong> will occur.
</p>

</div>

<p>Clearly a single exceptional value is not conclusive proof that the process is
out of control. However it is appropriate to examine carefully the operation of the process
to look for an assignable cause for this value (and adjust the process if such a cause
is discovered).
And a <strong>series</strong> of such values does indicate that the process is out of control.
