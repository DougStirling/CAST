<p class=heading>Samples instead of individual values</p>

<p>Individual values from a process often have skew distributions, making the
3-standard deviation control limits less reliable. However if small samples are
taken rather than individual values, the sample means will be closer to normally
distributed and have more predictable properties in control charts.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'> writeVideo('bk/general', 'controlChart', 'meanLimits', '458', '300');</script>

<p class=heading>Training data</p>

<p>In order to obtain control limits, we must know the mean and standard deviation 
  of the measurements when the process is 'in control'. These are usually estimated 
  from a set of 'training samples' in which great care is taken to avoid special 
  causes. </p>

<p>The process mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline"> 
  is estimated by the mean value from the training samples. We will initially 
  use the standard deviation of the training sample as our estimate, <em>s</em>, 
  but will describe a better estimate at the end of this page.</p>

<p>As in control charts for individual values, additional triggers can be used that depend
on several successive means. These are defined in the same way as those in control charts
for individual values. For example, six successive sample means either increasing
or decreasing suggest that there might be a special cause.
</p>
<p class=heading>Better estimate of <em>s</em> from training samples (advanced)</p>

<p>A different estimate of the process standard deviation, &sigma;, 
  is usually preferred to the overall standard deviation of the values in the 
training samples.</p>

<p class="gray">(An alternative estimate of
&sigma; that is occasionally used is</p>

<p class="gray">Although this estimate is better when the data have a reasonably symmetric 
  distribution, the earlier estimate is more 'robust' to problems in the training 
  data.) </p>
