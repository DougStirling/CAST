<p class="heading">Statistics for complex problems</p>
	<p>In practice, problems are rarely  well-defined and there may be various 
		different ways to collect data to throw light on them.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do we reduce hospital waiting lists?</li>
		<li>How do you design an ultrasonic sound generator to repel mice?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Collection and analysis of data to help attack the problem usually suggest 
		further questions for which further data are required. Several cycles of data 
		collection and analysis are usually needed, with considerable input from an expert 
		in the problem area between each cycle of the process. </p>
	<p class="heading">Continuous quality improvement</p>
	<p>In business 
		and industry, statistics is an important part of the long-term <strong>monitoring</strong> of performance. We may simply want to ensure that systems continue to perform at their current 
		levels, or the aim may be to <strong>improve</strong> aspects of the system. 
		The latter is often called <strong>continuous quality improvement</strong> or <strong>total quality management</strong>.</p>
	<p>Problems in a process are usually detected by collecting and analysing <strong>data</strong> about the performance of the system. This section describes the use of <strong>control charts</strong> as a way to monitor processes.</p>
