<p class="heading">Need for nonlinear models</p>  
  <p>In experiments with many potential explanatory factors, it is often sufficient 
		to model numerical factors with linear main effects and possibly interaction 
		terms. After a small number of potential explanatory variables have been identified, 
		it becomes feasible to investigate their effect on the response with a more 
		general class of models that allows the explanatory factors to affect the 
		response nonlinearly.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Although many relationships are approximately linear over some 
				range of values of the explanatory factors, most relationships are nonlinear 
				over a wider range of levels of the factors.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>Nonlinear models are also required in applications where factor levels are 
		sought to maximise or minimise the response (e.g. to maximise quality or minimise 
		spoilage).</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>In linear relationships, the maximum or minimum response occurs 
				when factor levels are ±&nbsp;infinity. Only nonlinear models can 
				have a maximum or minimum at finite values for the factors.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">Modelling curvature for a single factor</p>
	<p>The simplest way to extend the simple linear model for a single numerical 
		factor, X, is with a quadratic term,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/univarQuadModel.gif" width="420" height="23"> 
	</p>
	<p>The mean response has a maximum if β<sub>2</sub> 
		is positive at </p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/univarMax.gif" width="77" height="43"> </p>
	<p>If β<sub>2</sub> 
		is negative, the mean response is minimum at this value.</p>
	<p class="heading">Modelling curvature for two factors</p>
	<p>In a similar way, the linear model with two numerical factors, X and Z, can 
		be extended with quadratic terms in the two variables. If the model also includes 
		an interaction between between the factors, it becomes a full quadratic model:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/bivarQuadModel.gif" width="586" height="85"> </p>
	<p>The mean response in this model is a quadratic function of <em>x</em> and 
		<em>z</em> that is flexible enough to model a wide range of nonlinear relationships. 
		It defines a 3-dimensional surface.</p>

    <p>The diagram below initially shows a model with only linear terms in the 
			two factors, X and Z.</p>

			<dd>Drag the three arrows to investigate the range of surfaces corresponding

			<dt>Linear terms and interaction</dt>
			<dd>Click the checkbox <strong>Interaction term</strong> to add an interaction 
				to this model. With the interaction, there is one extra parameter to the 
				model, so there are four degrees of freedom and four arrows that can adjust 
				the surface.</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dd>Click the <strong>y-x</strong> and <strong>y-z</strong> rotation buttons 
				and observe that the cross-sections of the surface are all linear so there 
				is no finite maximum or minimum.</dd>
			<dt>Quadratic model</dt>
			<dd>Select the checkboxes <strong>Quadratic term in Factor X</strong> and 
				<strong>Quadratic term in Factor X</strong>, leaving <strong>Interaction 
				term</strong> also checked. This model has six degrees of freedom (six 
				parameters and six draggable red arrows). Drag the arrows to investigate 
				the possible relationships that this model can represent.</dd>
