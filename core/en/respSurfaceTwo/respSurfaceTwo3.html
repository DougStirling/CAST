<p class="heading">Two-level factorial experiment</p>  
  <p>We first consider a factorial experiment with two levels for each factor 
		(coded as ±1). In this design, there are equal replications of the 
		four factor combinations shown in the diagram below.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/factorialDesign.gif" width="262" height="247"> 
	</p>
	<p>The resulting data allow fitting of the linear model with interaction,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/linInteractModel.gif" width="266" height="18"> 
	</p>
	<p>However there is not enough information to assess the linearity of the factor 
		effects or fit models with quadratic terms in X or Y.</p>
	<p class="heading">Factorial experiment with centre points</p>
	<p>Adding centre points to the design allows the linearity of the model to be 
		assessed using an analysis of variance table with <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('twoNExper7')">one 
		degree of freedom for nonlinearity</a>.</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/centrePointDesign.gif" width="262" height="247">

	<p>However although this design permits a test of whether a nonlinear model 
		is necessary, the resulting data do not contain enough information to fit 
		the full quadratic model,</p>

    <p>In an experiment to assess how the reaction time and temperature affect 
			the yield of a chemical process, there was a single replicate of a 2<sup>2</sup> 
			factorial experiment (with <em>Time</em> set at 80 and 100 and <em>Temperature</em> 
			at 140 and 150°C), augmented by four replicates of the centre point 
			of the design. The diagram below initially shows the five factor combinations

  <p class="heading">Central composite designs</p>  
  <p>A 2<em><sup>k</sup></em> factorial design for <em>k</em> factors must be 
		augmented with extra design points to allow a quadratic model to be fitted. 
		The usual way to do this is with two additional runs for each of the <em>k</em> 
		factors in which all other factors are set at their centre value and that 
		factor takes two levels that are more extreme than those in the factorial 
		part of the design. These extra runs are called <strong>star points</strong> 
		for the design.</p>
	<p>For a 2-factor design, setting these extreme values at ±1.414 (when 
		the factorial levels are coded as ±1) and using the same number of 
		replicates as in the factorial part of the design gives the design an important 
		property. When the model is fitted and used to predict the response, the predictions 
		are equally accurate in all directions around the design centre &mdash; the accuracy 
		of the predicted reponse depends only on the distance from the centre point. 
		(A design with this property is called <strong>rotatable</strong>.)</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/centralCompDesign.gif" width="262" height="247"> 
	</p>
	<p>This design is called a <strong>central composite</strong> design. There 
		is often only a single replicate throughout, except for the centre point of 
		the design for which there are often 5 or 6 replicates to allow the experimental 
		error to be estimated.</p>
	<p class="heading">Sequential design</p>
	<p>Sometimes an initial 2<sup>2</sup> factorial design is conducted with a few 
		replicates of the centre point of the design. If the test for linearity indicates 
		that there is curvature, extra runs of the experiment can be conducted at 
		the star points to fit a response surface. If the levels used for the factorial 
		experiment are set at the extreme factor levels that are permissible (e.g. 
		an additive may be restricted to values between 0 and 5), then the star points 
		of the above central composite design will be outside these limits.</p>
	<p>One solution is to ensure that the initial factor levels for the 2<sup>2</sup> 
		factorial design are well within the allowed values, ensuring that any subsequent 
		star points are 'legal'. If a factor must take values between ±1, then 
		setting the levels for the initial factorial design at ±<sup>1</sup>/<sub>1.414</sub> 
		will ensure that the subsequent star points will be at ±1. This does 
		however mean that the main effects for the factors are less accurately estimated 
		than in a 2<sup>2</sup> factorial design with factor levels at ±1.</p>
	<p class="heading">Face-centred central composite designs</p>
	<p>An alternative design brings the star points back to levels ±1 instead 
		of ±1.414. This is sometimes called a <strong>face-centred</strong> 
		central composite design. When there are only two factors, this design is 
		identical to a full factorial design for two factors with 3 levels (plus some 
		extra centre points).</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/factorial3Design.gif" width="262" height="247"> 
	</p>
	<p>The centre-faced design is not rotatable, so:</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A standard central composite design is usually preferred unless 
				star points are <span class="black">sequentially</span> added to a 2<sup>2</sup> 
				factorial design in which the factor levels are already at their permitted 
				limits.</p>
