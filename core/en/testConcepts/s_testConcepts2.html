<p>All types of hypothesis test conform to the same framework.</p>
<p class="heading">Data and model</p>
<p>Hypothesis tests are based on data that are collected by some random mechanism. We can usually specify some characteristics of this random mechanism — a <strong>model</strong> for the data.</p>
<p>In this e-book, we assume that the data are a <strong>random sample</strong> from some distribution and may even be able to argue that this distribution belongs to a specific family such as a Poisson distribution. We concentrate on some specific characteristic of this family of distributions — a <strong>parameter</strong> of the distribution whose value is unknown.</p>
<p class="heading">Null and alternative hypotheses</p>
<p>In hypothesis testing, we want to compare two statements about an unknown parameter in the model.</p>
<p>The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> is the more restrictive of the two hypotheses and often specifies a single value for the unknown parameter such as \(\alpha = 0\). It is a 'default' value that can be accepted as holding if there is no evidence against it. A researcher often collects data with the express hope of <strong>disproving</strong> the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis is not true, we say that the <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> holds. (You can understand most of hypothesis testing without paying much attention 
to the alternative hypothesis however!)</p>
<div class="centred">
	<div class="boxed">
		<p>Either the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis must be true.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<p class="heading">Simplifying the null hypothesis</p>
<p>In some situations, both the null and alternative hypotheses cover <strong>ranges</strong> of values for the parameter. To simplify the analysis, we do the test as though the null hypothesis specified the <strong>single</strong> value closest to the alternative hypothesis range.</p>
<p>For example, we treat the hypotheses</p>
<ul>
	<li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\lambda \le \diagfrac {\small 1} {\small 110}\)   (manufacturer correct)</li>
	<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>:  \(\lambda \gt \diagfrac {\small 1} {\small 110}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>in exactly the same way as</p>
<ul>
	<li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\lambda = \diagfrac {\small 1} {\small 110}\)</li>
	<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>:  \(\lambda \gt \diagfrac {\small 1} {\small 110}\)</li>
</ul>
