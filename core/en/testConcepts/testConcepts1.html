<p class="heading">Statistical inference</p>
<p>The term <strong>statistical inference</strong> refers to 
	techniques for obtaining information about a statistical model's parameter (or parameters) based on data that result from the model. In the context of this e-book, the statistical model is usually a standard distribution and the data are
	a  random sample from that distribution. There are two different but related
	types of question about the  parameter (or parameters) that we might ask.</p>
<p class=heading>What parameter values would be consistent with the sample data?</p>
<p>This branch of inference is called <strong>estimation</strong> and its main 
	tool is a confidence interval.</p>

<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Estimating μ</p>

<p>A manufacturer of muesli bars needs to describe the average fat content of 
the bars (the mean, \(\mu\), of the distribution of fat contents that would be 
produced using the recipe). Several bars are analysed and their fat contents are 
measured.</p>
<p>The sample mean is a point estimate of the  mean fat content of the bars, and a 95% confidence 
	interval can also be found.</p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Are the sample data consistent with some statement about the parameters?</p>
<p>This branch of inference is called <strong>hypothesis testing</strong> and 
	is the focus of this chapter. </p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Testing whether μ is 3.4</p>
	<p>A particular brand of muesli bar is claimed by the manufacturer to have a fat 
content of 3.4&nbsp;g per bar. A consumer group suspects that the manufacturer is understating 
the fat content, so a random sample of bars is analysed.</p>
	<p>The consumer group must assess whether the data are consistent with the statement 
		(hypothesis) that the underlying  mean fat content for this type of bar is \(\mu =  3.4\) g.</p>
</div>
<p class=heading>Uncertainty and strength of evidence</p>
<p>When we studied parameter estimation, we saw that a distribution's parameter cannot 
	be determined <strong>exactly</strong> from a single random sample &mdash; there is 
	a 5% chance that a 95% confidence interval will <strong>not</strong> include the 
	true  parameter value. </p>
<p>In a similar way, a single random sample can rarely provide enough information
	about a  parameter to allow us to be <strong>sure</strong> whether or not any statement
	about it will be true. The best we can hope for is an indication
	of the <strong>strength of the evidence</strong> against the statement. </p>
<p>We will next show how this evidence is obtained and reported.</p>
