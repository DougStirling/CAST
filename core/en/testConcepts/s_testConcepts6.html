<p class="heading">Distribution of p-values</p>
<p>In any hypothesis test, </p>
<dl>
  <dt>When the null hypothesis, <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>, is true</dt>
  <dd>All p-values
    between 0 and 1 are equally likely. In other words, the p-value has a distribution
  whose probability density function has constant height between 0 and 1, \(\text{p-value} \sim \RectDistn(0, 1)\).</dd>
  <dt>When that alternative hypothesis, <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> is true<br>
  </dt>
  <dd>The p-values then have a distribution for which p-values near zero are more likely
    than p-values near 1. The precise distribution under the alternative hypothesis depends on the
    specific hypotheses being tested and the true value of the parameter, but it always favours
    values near 0.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The diagram below shows typical distributions that might be obtained. </p>

<p class="heading">P-values and probability</p>
<p>P-values have a rectangular distribution between 0 and 1
	when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds. A
	consequence of this is that the probability of obtaining a p-value of 0.1 or lower is
	exactly 0.1 (when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds).
	This is illustrated on the left of the diagram below. </p>

<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="../testPValue/images/pValueProbs.gif" width="525" height="187"></p>

<p>Similarly, the probability of obtaining a p-value of 0.01 or lower is exactly 
	0.01, etc. (when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds). </p>

<div class="boxed"><p>P-values are more likely to be near 0 than near 1 if the alternative 
				hypothesis holds</p></div>
