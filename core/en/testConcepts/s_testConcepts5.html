<p class="heading">One- and two-tailed tests</p>
<p>In some situations, the alternative hypothesis only allows for probabilities on <strong>one</strong> side of the null hypothesis value, such as</p>
<ul>
	<li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\pi = \diagfrac {\small 1} {\small 3} \)</li>
	<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>: \(\pi \gt \diagfrac {\small 1} {\small 3}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called a <strong>one-tailed</strong> test. However the alternative hypothesis often allows for parameter values on <strong>either </strong>side of the null hypothesis value â€” called a <strong>two-tailed</strong> test. An example would be</p>
<ul>
  <li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\pi = \diagfrac {\small 1} {\small 3} \)</li>
	<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>: \(\pi \ne \diagfrac {\small 1} {\small 3}\)</li>
</ul>
<p class="heading">P-value for two-tailed test</p>

<p>A two-tailed test is usually based on the same test statistic that would be used for the corresponding one-tailed test, but values in <strong>both tails</strong> of its distribution usually give support to the alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>The p-value is <strong>double</strong> the smaller tail area of the test statistic, to take account of the fact that values in the opposite tail of the distribution would give equally strong evidence against <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Example: Ethics codes in companies</p>
	<p>In 1999, <em>The Conference Board</em> surveyed 124 companies and found that 
97 had their own ethics codes (&quot;Business Bulletin&quot;, <em>Wall Street 
Journal</em>, Aug 19, 1999). In 1997, it was believed that 72% of companies 
had ethics codes, so is there any evidence that the proportion has changed?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\pi = 0.72 \)</li>
		<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>: \(\pi \ne 0.72 \)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong> is true, the number with an ethics code will be</p>
\[
X \;\;\sim\;\; \BinomDistn(n=124, \pi = 0.72) 
\]
	<p>The p-value is found from this distribution,</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_twoTailed.png" width="400" height="180" alt=""/></p>
	<p>Getting 97 companies with 
	  ethics codes is therefore <strong>not</strong> unlikely, so we conclude that there is no evidence <strong>from these data</strong> of a change in the proportion of companies with 
  ethics codes since 1997. </p>
