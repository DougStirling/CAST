<p class="heading">Distribution of p-values</p>
<p>In any hypothesis test, </p>
<dl>
  <dt>When the null hypothesis, <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>, is true</dt>
  <dd>All p-values
    between 0 and 1 are equally likely. In other words, the p-value has a distribution
  whose probability density function has constant height between 0 and 1, \(\text{p-value} \sim \RectDistn(0, 1)\).</dd>
  <dt>When that alternative hypothesis, <b>H<sub>A</sub></b> is true<br>
  </dt>
  <dd>The p-values then have a distribution for which p-values near zero are more likely
    than p-values near 1. The precise distribution under the alternative hypothesis depends on the
    specific hypotheses being tested and the true value of the parameter, but it always favours
    values near 0.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The diagram below shows typical distributions that might be obtained. </p>

<p class="heading">P-values and probability</p>
<p>P-values have a rectangular distribution between 0 and 1
	when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds. A
	consequence of this is that the probability of obtaining a p-value of 0.1 or lower is
	exactly 0.1 (when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds).
	This is illustrated on the left of the diagram below. </p>

<p class="eqn"><img class="svgImage" src="../testPValue/images/pValueProbs.gif" width="525" height="187"></p>

<p>Similarly, the probability of obtaining a p-value of 0.01 or lower is exactly 
	0.01, etc. (when <b>H<sub>0</sub></b> holds). </p>

<div class="boxed"><p>P-values are more likely to be near 0 than near 1 if the alternative 
				hypothesis holds</p></div>

<div class="example" title="Simulation to show distribution of p-values">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Simulation</p>
	<p>To illustrate the distribution of p-values, we will perform a hypothesis test about the parameter \(\mu\) of a \(\NormalDistn(\mu, \sigma^2)\) distribution based on a sample of size \(n=40\). We will test the following hypotheses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Null hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\mu = 0\)</li>
		<li>Alternative hypothesis, <strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>: \(\mu \ne 0\)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The details of the test will be <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('testNormal2')">described in a later section</a>, but we will use a simulation to illustrate the distribution of p-values that would result when the null hypothesis does and does not hold.</p>

	<dl>
	  <dt>When the null hypothesis is true</dt>
	  <dd>Initially the simulation is conducted using random samples from a normal distribution in which \(\mu = 0\) and the null hypothesis therefore holds. Click the button <strong>Take sample</strong> 50 or more times (or hold the button down)  to take  samples from this
	    distribution and add their p-values to the display on the right.</dd>
	  <dd>The diagram on the top
	    right shows the proportion of p-values that are less than any value â€” an approximation to the cumulative distribution function of the p-values. Approximately
	    50% of p-values are less than 0.5, 20% are less than 0.2, etc. when the null hypothesis is true. </dd>
  </dl>
  <div class="boxed">
  <p>It is still possible to get small p-values, even if H<sub>0</sub> is true. It is always possible to be misled by an 'unlucky' sample!</p></div>

	<dl>
	  <dt>When the null hypothesis is false</dt>
	  <dd>Use the slider to change the distribution's true  mean to \(\mu = 1.5\) and repeat. From the diagram
	    on the top right, you should observe that more than 50% of p-values are less than 0.5, more than
	    20% are less than 0.2, etc. when the alternative hypothesis holds.</dd>
	  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
	  <dd>When \(\mu\) is increased to 3.0 (much further from the null hypothesis value) and the simulation repeated, the p-value is almost certain to be very small.</dd>
	  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>

	<div class="boxed">
	  <p>When H<sub>A</sub> is true, large p-values are often still possible, but are less likely than small p-values. It is again possible to be misled by an 'unlucky' sample!</p>
