<p class="heading">Assumption of negligible interaction</p>
  <p>All three main effects are confounded with 2-factor interactions in a 2<sup>3-1</sup> 
    fractional factorial experiment defined by</p>
  <p class="eqn">C&nbsp; = &nbsp; AB</p>
  <p>Therefore in order to use the estimated main effects to rank the importance 
    of the factors,</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>It must be assumed that the interactions are zero (or at least 
        negligible compared to the main effects).</p>
</div></div>

  <p class="heading">Tests</p>  
  <p>The main effects of all three factors can be estimated, but with only four 
    runs there are no residual degrees of freedom. As a result,</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>It is impossible to test the significance of the main effects.</p>
</div></div>

  
  <p>Using this design for screening would therefore be an exploratory technique 
    and should be followed by an experiment with more runs (and fewer factors) 
    to estimate interactions and assess the significance of the effects.</p>
