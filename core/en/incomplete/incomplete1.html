<p class="heading">Many factor levels and small blocks</p>  
  <p>Incomplete designs arise in experiments with more treatments than experimental units or, if the experimental units are grouped into blocks, with more treatments than the block size. We have already studied one solution for multi-factor experiments:</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>Fractional factorial experiments  leave each main factor effects  orthogonal to other factors and the blocks &mdash; they are only confounded with high-order interactions.</p>
  </div></div>
  <p>A different situation arises in  experiments with  a <strong>single</strong> factor that has more levels than the block size. This often arises in variety trials in agriculture where 50 or more varieties may be assessed but the experimental units (often plots of land or containers in greenhouses) are grouped into relatively small blocks (fields or shelves in the greenhouse).</p>
  <p>An incomplete design is again required if there are more treatments than the block size but, since there is only a single factor, fractional factorial designs cannot be used.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>Which treatments should be allocated to each experimental unit?</p>
  </div></div>
  <p>This section describes some experimental designs for this situation.</p>
  <p class="heading">Principles</p>
  <p>Two main principles  are usually followed in the design of experiments with more factor levels than the block size:</p>
  <dl>
  	<dt>Use  all factor levels in the same number of experimental units</dt>
  	<dd>This may be violated if one factor level is a control level, but we are often equally interested in all factor levels so repeating each the same number of times is usually best.</dd>
  	<dt>Use all pairs of factor levels together in the same number of blocks</dt>
  	<dd>An experiment with this property is called <strong>balanced</strong>. It allows all pairs of treatments to be compared with similar accuracy.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Neither of these principles is essential &mdash; we can analyse data from unbalanced experiments and ones with factor levels that have been used different numbers of times.</p>
  <div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Experiments with 8 factor levels</p>
<p>The diagram below shows  experimental designs with different block sizes for comparing 8 factor levels (A, B, ..., H). For each design,</p>
<ul>
	<li>the red upper triangle shows the number of times each pair of levels appears together in the same block</li>
	<li>The blue lower triangle shows the  standard errors that would arise from this experiment for the estimated differences between each pair of factor levels, assuming that the error standard deviation is Ïƒ&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results are initially shown for an experiment in which there are 8 experimental units in each block. Since all factor levels can be used in each block, an orthogonal design can be used, so each  treatment occurs with every other treatment in all blocks &mdash; the design is balanced &mdash; and all pairs of treatments can be compared with equal accuracy.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Block size 7 (balanced)</strong> from the pop-up menu. In this design, blocks and the factor are not orthogonal, but the design is balanced &mdash; all pairs of treatments occur together in 6 of the 8 blocks &mdash; so again all treatments can be compared with equal accuracy.</p>
<p>Balance cannot be achieved with smaller block sizes. Select <strong>Block size 6 (nearly balanced)</strong> from the pop-up menu. In this design, all pairs of treatments occur together in either 4 or 5 blocks. Observe that when pairs of treatments  occur together  5 times, the difference is estimated more accurately (lower standard error), but because the design is almost balanced, the standard errors for all differences are similar.</p>
<p>Now select <strong>Block size 2 (unbalanced)</strong> from the pop-up menu. Each treatment only occurs in the same block as two others so the design is extremely unbalanced &mdash; some pairs of treatments can be compared much more accurately than others.</p>
<p>Finally use the pop-up menu to compare the two designs with <strong>Block size 3</strong> and note how the design affects the accuracy of comparing factor levels. Picking a design that is nearly balanced is  not always easy.</p>
