<p class=heading>Simulation and randomisation</p>
<p>Simulation and randomisation are closely related techniques. Both are based 
on assumptions about the model underlying the data and involve randomly generated 
data sets.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Simulation</dt>
<dd>New data sets are generated directly from the model.</dd>
<dt>Randomisation</dt>
<dd>Modifications to the actual data are identified that would have the same probability 
of arising if the model held. New data sets are randomly picked from these</dd>
</dl>

<p>Randomisation is understood most easily through an example.</p>
<p class=heading>Comparing two groups</p>
<p>If random samples are taken from two populations, we are often interested in 
whether the populations have the same means.</p>
<p>If the two populations were identical, any allocation of the sample values 
to the two groups would have been as likely as the observed sample data. By observing 
the distribution of the difference in means from such randomised allocations of 
values to groups, we can get an idea of whether the actual difference in sample 
means is unusually large.</p>
<p>An example helps to explain this method.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Lengths of Coyotes">
<p class=heading>Lengths of Coyotes</p>

<p>In a study of coyotes, 40 female and 43 males were captured in Nova Scotia. 
The diagram below shows the lengths (cm) of these coyotes. The mean length of 
the males was 2.8 cm greater than the mean length of the females, but the distributions 
overlap considerably. Might this difference be simply a result of randomness, 
or can we conclude that there is a difference in the underlying populations?</p>

<p>Click <strong>Randomise</strong> to randomly pick 40 of the the 83 values for 
the female group. If the underlying distribution of lengths was the same for males 
and females, each such randomised allocation would be as likely as the observed 
data.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> and repeat the randomisation several more 
times. Observe that the difference in means is as far from zero as 2.8 cm in about 
6 percent of these randomisations when we assume the same distribution for both 
groups. A difference in sample means of 2.8 cm is therefore not particularly unusual 
if the male and female distributions are the same.</p>
<p>Since the actual difference is not unusually large,&nbsp;...</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We can conclude that there is very little evidence from the data that 
the mean length of female coyotes is different from the mean length of the males.</p>
