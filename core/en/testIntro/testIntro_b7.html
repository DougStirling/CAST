<p class="heading">A general framework</p>
<p>The examples in earlier pages of this section involved different types of data 
and different analyses. Indeed, you may find it difficult to spot their common 
theme!</p>
<p>All analyses were examples of <strong>hypothesis testing</strong>. We now describe 
the general framework of hypothesis testing within which all of these examples 
fit. This general framework is the basis for important applications in later sections 
of CAST.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The concepts in this page are extremely important &mdash; make sure that 
you understand them well before moving on.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="heading">Data, model and question</p>
<dl>
<dt>Data (and model)</dt>
<dd>Each example dealt with a data set that was assumed to arise from some random
mechanism. We may be able to specify some aspects of this random mechanism (model),
but it also has unknown characteristics</dd>
<dt>Null hypothesis</dt>
<dd>All models had unknown characteristics, and we want to know whether the model
has particular properties &mdash; the <strong>null hypothesis</strong>.</dd>
<dt>Alternative hypothesis</dt>
<dd>If the null hypothesis is not true, we say that the <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> holds.
(You can understand most of hypothesis testing without paying much attention to the
alternative hypothesis however!)</dd>
</dl>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Either the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis must be true.</p>

<p class="heading">Approach</p>
<p>We assess whether the null hypothesis is true by asking&nbsp;...</p>

<div class="boxed" style="background-color:#FFFF00">
<p><span class="darkred">Are the data consistent with the null hypothesis?</span></p>
</div>

<p>It is <strong>extremely</strong> important that you understand that hypothesis
testing addresses this question &mdash; make sure that you remember it well!!</p>
<p class="heading">Answering the question</p>
<dl>
<dt>Test statistic</dt>
<dd>This is some function of the data that throws light on whether the null or alternative
hypothesis holds.</dd>
<dt>P-value</dt>
<dd>Testing whether the data are consistent with the null hypothesis is based on
the probability of obtaining a test statistic value as 'extreme' as the one recorded <strong>if
the null hypothesis holds</strong>. This is called the p-value for the test.</dd>
<dt>Interpreting the p-value</dt>
<dd>Although it may be regarded as an over-simplification, the table below can be
used as a guide to interpreting p-values.</dd>

<div id="ex1" style="display:block">
<p class="heading">Soccer league in one season</p>
<dl>
<dt>Data (and model)</dt>
<dd>Some random mechanism underlies the actual results in the matches during a 
season. The probabilities of winning may vary from team to team and there may 
be a home-team advantage, so there are a lot of unknowns about this model! Our 
data are a single set of results &mdash; the league table at the end of the season.</dd>
<dt>Null hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that all teams are equally matched &mdash; i.e. that they 
all have the same probability of winning each match.</dd>
<dt>Alternative hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The alternative hypothesis is that all teams do <strong>not</strong> have the
same probabilities of winning.</dd>
<dt>Test statistic</dt>
<dd>The standard deviation of final points is used. It will be low if the teams
have the same abilities (null hypothesis) and higher otherwise (alternative hypothesis).</dd>
<dt>P-value</dt>
<dd>We simulated the soccer league, assuming that all teams had the same probability 
of winning. The p-value was the probability of getting a standard deviation of 
final points as high as 19.3 (the actual data).</dd>
<dt>Interpreting the p-value</dt>
<dd>The p-value was 0.000 (or close). Since there is virtually no chance of getting a standard
deviation of points as high as that in the actual league from equally matched teams, we conclude
that the teams are <strong>not</strong> equally matched &mdash; the null hypothesis is false.</dd>
</dl>
</div>


<div id="ex2" style="display:none">
<p class="heading">Scaring whales from boats</p>
<dl>
<dt>Data (and model)</dt>
<dd>Each whale has some probability of leaving &mdash; our model. We also assume independence
of different whales, a reasonable assumption if the whales are encountered at different
times, but not if they appear in a group. A sample of 30 whales was used in the experiment
and our data is the number that left immediately.</dd>
<dt>Null hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that each whale has probability 0.4 of leaving immediately
&mdash; i.e. that the sound-transmitting device has no effect.</dd>
<dt>Alternative hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The alternative hypothesis is that whales have higher probability than 0.4 of
leaving immediately when the boat arrives.</dd>
<dt>Test statistic</dt>
<dd>The number of whales that leave immediately is the test statistic. It will be
near 12 (i.e. 0.4&times;30) if the device is ineffective (null hypothesis) and will
be greater than 12 if it works (the alternative hypothesis).</dd>
<dt>P-value</dt>
<dd>We simulated using the device on 30 whales, assuming that each had probability
0.4 of leaving immediately. The p-value was the probability of 15 or fewer of the
30 staying (the actual data).</dd>
<dt>Interpreting the p-value</dt>
<dd>A p-value of around 0.18 means that 15 or more whales leaving out of 30 is not
unusual if the device is ineffective &mdash; i.e. if the probability of leaving is 0.4.
There is therefore no evidence against the null hypothesis &mdash;  no evidence
supporting the effectiveness of the device.</dd>
</dl>
</div>


<div id="ex3" style="display:none">
<p class="heading">Net weight of corn flake packets</p>
<dl>
<dt>Data (and model)</dt>
<dd>We are told that the net weight of corn flake packets is normally distributed
with a standard deviation of σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;gm and unknown mean, µ. The data
are a random sample from this distribution.</dd>
<dt>Null hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that the weights of packets have a distribution with mean
µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520&nbsp;gm.</dd>
<dt>Alternative hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The alternative hypothesis is that µ&nbsp;≠&nbsp;520&nbsp;gm.</dd>
<dt>Test statistic</dt>
<dd>The mean weight of our sample of 10 packets is the test statistic. It will be
close to 520&nbsp;gm if the filling machine is working correctly (the null hypothesis)
and will be far from this if the mean filling weight has drifted from 520&nbsp;gm
(the alternative hypothesis).</dd>
<dt>P-value</dt>
<dd>We simulated samples of <em>n</em> = 10 values from a normal (µ = 520, σ&nbsp;=&nbsp;10)
distribution. The p-value was the probability of getting a sample mean as far from
520 as the value in our actual data (529).</dd>
<dt>Interpreting the p-value</dt>
<dd>A p-value of around 0.01 means that a sample mean weight as far from 520 gm as
the one we recorded would be very unlikely if the null hypothesis was true. There
is strong evidence that the mean weight is <strong>no longer</strong> 520 gm.</dd>
</dl>
</div>


<div id="ex4" style="display:none">
<p class="heading">Coyote lengths</p>
<dl>
<dt>Data (and model)</dt>
<dd>We assume that our data (lengths of coyotes) are random samples of 40 and 43
from underlying populations of female and male coyotes (respectively) in Nova Scotia.
Random sampling from these unknown populations is our model.</dd>
<dt>Null hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that the population distribution of coyote lengths is
the same for male and female animals.</dd>
<dt>Alternative hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The alternative hypothesis is that the distributions are different for males
and females.</dd>
<dt>Test statistic</dt>
<dd>The difference between the mean lengths of the male and female coyotes was the
test statistic. It should be close to zero if the null hypothesis holds, and far
from zero if the alternative hypothesis holds.</dd>
<dt>P-value</dt>
<dd>We randomised the 83 lengths between the two groups of coyotes (male and female)
&mdash; each such randomisation is equally likely if the populations are the same. The
p-value was the probability that the difference in means is further from zero than
2.8 cm (the actual data).</dd>
<dt>Interpreting the p-value</dt>
<dd>A p-value of 0.05 only gives weak evidence that the null hypothesis does not
hold &mdash; there is a moderately high probability of seeing such different sample means
if the male and female distributions are really the same.</dd>
</dl>
</div>


<div id="ex5" style="display:none">
<p class="heading">Soccer leagues in two seasons</p>
<dl>
<dt>Data (and model)</dt>
<dd>Some random mechanism again generates results during each season &mdash; our model.
In this case, we have recorded the number of points for each team at the end of two
successive seasons &mdash; our data.</dd>
<dt>Null hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The null hypothesis is that all teams (other than Manchester United, Arsenal,
Liverpool and Leeds) have the same probabilities of winning against the same opposition
in both seasons.</dd>
<dt>Alternative hypothesis</dt>
<dd>The alternative hypothesis is that the chances of teams winning in 2013/14 are related to their
performance in 2012/13.</dd>
<dt>Test statistic</dt>
<dd>The correlation coefficient between the final points of teams in the two seasons
is the test statistic. It will be close to zero if the teams have the same chances
of winning (the null hypothesis) and will be positive if some teams have higher chances
of winning than others (the alternative hypothesis).</dd>
<dt>P-value</dt>
<dd>We randomised the points in the second season &mdash; each is equally likely if the
teams have the same probability of winning. The p-value was the probability that
the correlation coefficient is further from zero than 0.798 (the actual data).</dd>
<dt>Interpreting the p-value</dt>
<dd>From a p-value that is close to zero, we conclude that a correlation coefficient as far
from zero would be unlikely if the null hypothesis was true, so there is 
strong evidence that the teams are <strong>not</strong> evenly matched.</dd>
