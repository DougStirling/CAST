<p class="heading">Statistical inference</p>

<p>The term <strong>statistical inference</strong> describes statistical
techniques that obtain information about a population parameter (or parameters) based on
a single random sample from that population. There are two different but related
types of question about the population parameter (or parameters) that we might ask:
</p>

<p class=heading>What parameter values would be consistent with the sample data?</p>

<p>This branch of inference is called <strong>estimation</strong> and its main 
tool is a confidence interval. We described confidence intervals in the previous 
chapter. </p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>A manufacturer of muesli bars needs to describe the average fat content of 
the bars (the mean of the hypothetical population of fat contents that would be 
produced using the recipe). Several bars are analysed and their fat contents are 
measured.</p>
<p>The sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean, and a 95% confidence 
interval can also be found. </p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Are the sample data consistent with some statement about the parameters?</p>
<p>This branch of inference is called <strong>hypothesis testing</strong> and 
is the focus of this chapter. </p>

<div class="diagram">

<p>A particular brand of meusli bar is claimed by the manufacturer to have a fat 
content of 3.4g per bar. A consumer group suspects that the manufacturer is understating 
the fat content, so a random sample of bars is analysed.</p>
<p>The consumer group must assess whether the data are consistent with the statement 
(hypothesis) that the underlying population mean is 3.4g. </p>

</div>

<p class=heading>Uncertainty and strength of evidence</p>
<p>When we studied parameter estimation, we saw that a population parameter cannot 
be determined <strong>exactly</strong> from a single random sample &mdash; there is 
a 5% chance that a 95% confidence interval will <strong>not</strong> include the 
true population parameter. </p>

<p>In a similar way, a single random sample can rarely provide enough information
about a population parameter to allow us to be sure whether or not any statement
about that parameter will be true. The best we can hope for is an indication
of the <strong>strength of the evidence</strong> against the statement. </p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter explains how this evidence is obtained and reported.</p>
