<p>In this page, another example of randomisation is described to assess whether 
teams in a soccer league are evenly matched.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: English Premier Soccer League in two seasons">
<p class=heading>English Premier Soccer League, 2012/13 and 2013/14</p>

<p>We saw earlier that the distribution of points in the 2013/14 English Premier 
Soccer League Table was <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('testIntro2')">not 
consistent with all teams being evenly matched</a> &mdash; the spread of points was 
too high. We will now investigate the teams' performances further.</p>
<p>If good performance in one year carries over into good performance in the following year, the positions of teams in the league 
in successive years will tend to be similar. The table below shows the points 
for the teams in two seasons. (Note that the bottom three teams are relegated 
each year and three teams are promoted from the lower league, so we cannot compare 
the positions of six of these 23 teams.)</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr> 
<th>&nbsp;</th>

</table></div>
<p>We will now use the apparent consistency of the teams from one year to the next to ask:</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>Do the good teams in one season also tend to do well in the following season?</p></div>
	
<p class=heading>Randomisation</p>
<p>If there is <strong>no carry-over effect</strong> of performance from one season to the next, 
the 2013/14 points of 42 (which was actually obtained by Swansea City) would have been 
equally likely to have been obtained by any of the teams in that year. Indeed, 
any allocation of the points (64, 86, 82, ..., 38) to the 17 teams that played in both years would be equally likely.</p>
<p>The diagram below performs this <strong>randomisation</strong> of the results 
in 2013/14.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Randomise</strong> to shuffle the 2013/14 points between the 
teams (excluding the  teams that were only in the league for 
one of the seasons). If the teams were of equal ability, these points would have 
been as likely as the actual ones.<span class="gray"></span></p>
<p>The correlation coefficient between the points in the two seasons gives an 
indication of how closely they are related. Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> 
and repeat the randomisation several more times. Observe that the correlation 
for the randomised values is hardly ever as far from zero as the actual correlation 
(<em>r</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.798). Since a correlation as high as 0.798 is unlikely when there is <strong>no</strong> consistency of performance from one season to the next,&nbsp;...</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>There is  strong evidence that the teams doing well in one season also do well in the following season. </p>
