<p>In this page, another example of randomisation is described to assess whether 
teams in a soccer league are evenly matched.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class=heading>English Premier Soccer League, 2007/08 and 2008/09</p>

<p>We saw earlier that the distribution of points in the 2008/09 English Premier 
Soccer League Table was <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('testIntro2')">not 
consistent with all teams being evenly matched</a> &mdash; the spread of points was 
too high. We will now investigate this further.</p>
<p>If some teams are better than others, the positions of teams in the league 
in successive years will tend to be similar. The table below shows the points 
for the teams in two seasons. (Note that the bottom three teams are relegated 
each year and three teams are promoted from the lower league, so we cannot compare 
the positions of six of the teams.)</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<p>Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool were the top four teams in both years. However,&nbsp;...</p>

	<tr>

<p class=heading>Randomisation</p>
<p>If all other teams have equal probabilities of winning against any opponent, 
the 2008/09 points of 45 (which was actually obtained by Wigan) would have been 
equally likely to have been obtained by any of the teams in that year. Indeed, 
any allocation of the points (63, 62, 41, ..., 53) to the teams (Everton, Aston Villa, 
Blackburn, ..., Fulham) would be equally likely.</p>
<p>The diagram below performs this <strong>randomisation</strong> of the results 
in 2008/09.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Randomise</strong> to shuffle the 2008/09 points between the 
teams (excluding the top four teams and those that were only in the league for 
one of the seasons). If the teams were of equal ability, these points would have 
been as likely as the actual ones.<span class="gray"></span></p>
<p>The correlation coefficient between the points in the two seasons gives an 
indication of how closely they are related. Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> 
and repeat the randomisation several more times. Observe that the correlation 
for the randomised values is only as far from zero as the actual correlation 
(<em>r</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.537) in about 5% of randomisations. Since a correlation as high as 0.537 is fairly unusual for 
equally-matched teams,&nbsp;...</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>There is moderately strong evidence of a difference in skill between teams, even when the top four have been excluded. </p>
