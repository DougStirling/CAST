<p class=heading>Other uses of simulation</p>
<p>Simulations can help us to answer questions about a variety of other models 
(or populations). The following example shows another simple simulation.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Security at LA International Airport">
<p class=heading>Is security at LA International Airport as good as elsewhere?</p>

<p>In 1987, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigated security at 
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). In one test, it was found that only 72 
out of 100 mock weapons that FAA inspectors tried to carry onto planes were detected 
by security guards (<em>Gainesville Sun</em>, Dec 11, 1987).</p>
<p>Is the FAA justified in claiming that this &quot;detection rate was well below 
the national rate of 0.80&quot;?</p>
	
<p class=heading>A simulation</p>
<p>If the detection rate at LAX was the same as elsewhere, and every weapon independently 
has probability 0.80 of being detected, we know that the number detected out of 
100 weapons will be a random quantity.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How unlikely is it to get as few as 72 out of 100 weapons detected 
if the probability of detection at LAX is 0.80 &mdash; the same as elsewhere?</p>
</div></div>

<p>A simulation helps to answer this question.</p>

<div class="centred">

</div>

<p>Click <strong>Simulate</strong> to randomly 'try to get 100 weapons onto planes', 
with each independently having probability 0.80 of detection. Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> 
then run the simulation between 100 and 200 times. <span class="gray">(Hold 
down the <strong>Simulate</strong> button to speed up the process.)</span></p>
<p>Observe the distribution of the number of weapons detected. The proportion 
of simulations with 72 or fewer weapons being detected is shown to the right of 
the dot plot. Observe that this rarely happens.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We therefore conclude that the FAA's claim that LAX has a poorer detection 
rate than elsewhere is justified &mdash; only 72 weapons being detected would be unlikely 
if the detection rate was really 0.80.</p>
</div></div>


<p>We will return to this example later.</p>
