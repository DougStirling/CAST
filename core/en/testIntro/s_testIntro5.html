<p class=heading>Simulation and randomisation</p>
<p>Simulation and randomisation both involve randomly generated
data sets.</p>

<p class=heading>Randomisation of samples from two populations</p>
<p>Consider random samples from two populations. If these populations are identical,
any of the sampled values could have equally belonged to either population. Random
variations of the data can be generated by randomly allocating the values to
the two samples.</p>
<p>The diagram below gives an example of two-group data and a random allocation
of the 101 values to the two groups.</p>

<p class=heading>Test for equal population means</p>
<p>In the example above, the mean for Group A was 0.902 higher than that for
Group B. To examine whether the underlying population means are equal, we can
find how far apart the sample means would be in randomised variations of the
data.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the difference between the Group A and Group B means
for 100 randomised variations of the data.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_randomiseDist.gif" width="475" height="165"></p>
<p>A difference between sample means as large as that recorded would be unusual
if both underlying populations were the same, so</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We  conclude that there is strong evidence that the population means for the
two groups are different.</p>
