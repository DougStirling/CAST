<p class=heading>Is a population proportion equal to 0.8, or is it lower?</p>
<p>Consider a random sample of <em>n</em> = 100 values from a population in which
it is claimed that the probability of success is at least 0.80.</p>
<p>Is an observed count of <em>x</em> = 72 successes low enough to throw
doubt on the claimed probability of success, 0.80?</p>
<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
<p>We can perform a simulation with probability 0.80 of success to generate
a random sample 100 successes and failures. The
diagram below shows the numbers of successes in 200 such simulations.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_successSim.gif" width="401" height="209"></p>
<p>If the probability of success was really 0.80, there would
be approximately <sup>10</sup>/<sub>200</sub> = 5% chance of 72 or successes
being observed. Since this is low,</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is moderately strong evidence that the probability
of success is less than 0.80 &mdash; observing only 72 successes would be unlikely
if the probability really was 0.80.</p>
