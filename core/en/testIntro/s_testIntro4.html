<p class=heading>Does a random sample have mean  520?</p>
<p>In an industrial process, some measurement, <em>X</em>, is
normally distributed with standard deviation σ = 10. Its mean should be µ = 520
but  can drift from this, so samples of <em>n</em> = 10 measurements are regularly
collected as part of quality control.</p>
<p>If one such sample had mean 529, does the process need to
be adjusted? The question can be reexpressed as:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If the underlying population mean was really µ = 520, what is the chance a
sample of 10 values having a mean as far from 520 as 529?</p>
</div></div>
<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
<p>We can base our answer on the distribution of the sample mean, assuming that
<em>X</em> has a normal distribution with µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520 and
σ = 10. Simulations of 10 values from this distribution can be used to
get an approximate distribution.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_meanSim.gif" width="402" height="173"></p>
<p>From the 200 simulated samples above, it seems very unlikely that a sample
mean of 529 would have been recorded if the process meanhad been µ&nbsp;=&nbsp;520.
We therefore conclude that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is strong evidence that the process no longer has a mean  of µ = 520
and needs to be adjusted.</p>
