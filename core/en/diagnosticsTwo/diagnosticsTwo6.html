<p class="heading">Influence on fitted values</p>
  <p>As in simple linear regression, high-leverage points have the <strong>potential</strong> 
		to strongly influence the conclusions from a data set.</p>
	<p>Leverage is only a function of the explanatory variables, and we also need 
		to take into account the response values for any high-leverage points to see 
		whether they are <strong>actually</strong> influential.</p>

  <p>One measure of influence relates to how deletion of each point affects that 
		point's fitted value,</p>
	<p class=eqn> <img src="../diagnostics/images/dfits.gif" width="149" height="51"> 
	</p>
	<p>Observations are often classified as 'influential' if</p>
	<p class=eqn> <img src="images/dfitsGuideline.gif" width="148" height="37"> 
	</p>
	<p>It can be proved that <em>DFITS</em> is a simple function of the externally 
		studentised residual and the leverage,</p>
	<p class=eqn> <img src="../diagnostics/images/dfits2.gif" width="154" height="41" alt="log(wt) = log(a) + p log(len)"></p>
	<p class="heading">Influence on parameter estimates</p>
	<p>An alternative is to look at how deletion of each point affects the regression 
		coefficients,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/bChanges.gif" width="83" height="73"></p>
	<p>Instead of separately examining the influence on each parameter estimate, 
		they are usually combined into a single statistics, called <strong>Cook's 
		D</strong>. Although it can be defined in terms of the above differences, 
		it can also be expressed in terms of the standardised residuals and leverages,</p>
	<p class=eqn> <img src="images/cookDDefn.gif" width="134" height="43" alt="log(wt) = log(a) + p log(len)"> 
	</p>
	<p>Therefore the two influence measures are related,</p>
