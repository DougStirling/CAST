<p class="heading">Problems with <span class="darkred">all</span> data points</p>
  <p>The relationship between a reponse and two explanatory variables is not always 
		described well by the multiple linear regression model,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="../regnInfTwo/images/normModelTwo2.gif" width="418" height="21"> 
	</p>
	<p>Some problems relate to the fit of the model to <strong>all</strong> data 
		points. </p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Nonlinearity</dt>
		<dd>Perhaps the response or one of the explanatory variables should be transformed.</dd>
		<dt>Interaction between <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em></dt>
		<dd>The effect of <em>X</em> may vary, depending on the value of <em>Z</em>.</dd>
		<dt>Non-constant variance</dt>
		<dd>The error standard deviation is often higher when the response mean is 
			higher. This is often associated with nonlinearity and a transformation 
			of the response often fixes both problems.</dd>
		<dt>Non-normal errors</dt>
		<dd>The errors are assumed to be normally distributed. This is not usually 
			a major problem and we will not discuss it further here.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Nonlinearity and interaction were investigated in the previous two sections.</p>
	<p class="heading">Problems with a <span class="darkred">single</span> data 
		point</p>
	<p>Other problems that are specific to a few data points will be investigated 
		in this section.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Outliers</dt>
		<dd>Response measurements that do not fit with the rest of the data &mdash; possibly 
			measurement errors or individuals that should be analysed separately from 
			the others.</dd>
		<dt>Influential points</dt>
		<dd>Do the conclusions depend unduely on one or two observations?</dd>
	</dl>
	<p class="heading">Diagnostics for outliers, leverage and influence</p>
	<p>These problems were investigated earlier for models with a single explanatory 
		variable. The regression diagnostics that are described in this section are 
		extensions of these. They will be further extended later to models with three 
		or more explanatory variables where they are specially important since the 
		raw data cannot be fully examined with scatterplots.</p>
	<p>We write the general linear model in the form,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/multipleRegnModel.gif" width="535" height="55"></p>
<br>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>To foreshadow the general linear model with <em>p</em> explanatory 
				variables, we phrase some guidelines for the regression diagnostics in 
				terms of <em>p</em>.</p>
</div></div>

  <p>Note that <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 for the simple linear model and <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 
		for the regression model with two explanatory variables.</p>
