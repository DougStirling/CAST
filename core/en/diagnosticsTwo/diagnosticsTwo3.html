<p class="heading">Advantages of high leverage</p>
  <p>Selecting a new observation at a point, <span class="red">(<em>x</em>,&nbsp;<em>z</em>)</span>, 
		with high leverage should give good improvement in the accuracy of the least 
		squares parameter estimates, but <strong>only if the new observation conforms 
		to the same linear model as the rest of the data</strong>.</p>
	<p class="heading">Problems with high leverage</p>
	<p>We are rarely sure that the relationship is linear for all <span class="red">(<em>x</em>,&nbsp;<em>z</em>)</span>. 
		Even though linearity is often reasonable in a restricted range of <span class="red">(<em>x</em>,&nbsp;<em>z</em>)</span>, 
		this may not be true at high leverage points on the 'outskirts' of the data.</p>
	<p>Even more seriously, it is always possible that an observation may have been 
		incorrectly recorded or the individual may have different characteristics 
		from the bulk of the data &mdash; it could be an <strong>outlier</strong>. An observation 
		at a high leverage point has the potential to strongly influence the results 
		if it is also an outlier.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, outliers often do not show up as residuals that are unusually 
		far from zero. Because a high leverage point pulls the least squares plane 
		so much, the outlier may have a residual that has similar size to the other 
		residuals.</p>

    <p>Rotate the 3-dimensional scatterplot by dragging the centre with the mouse 
			(but avoiding the red arrow.) All points lie near to a plane, so a normal 
			linear model is appropriate.</p>
		<p>Click the y-x-z button, then drag the cross in the centre of the diagram 
			to make it an outlier. Observe that the residual plot will show this point 
			as an extreme residual.</p>
		<p>Select <strong>High leverage</strong> from the pop-up menu then drag the 
			cross on the right. Because it is a high leverage point, it strongly pulls 
			the least squares plane towards itself, so its residual does not stand out 
			much from the other residuals, even though it is an outlier.</p>

	<p class="heading">Rule-of-thumb for high leverage points</p>
	<p>It can be shown that the leverages of all data points sum to <em>p</em>, 
		where <em>p</em> is the number of linear parameters in the model (with <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 
		for the linear model with two explanatory variables), so their average value 
		is <em><sup>p</sup></em>/<em><sub>n</sub></em>. A rule-of-thumb is therefore 
		to call a point 'high leverage' if its leverage is more than double this value.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Examine carefully points with <em>h<sub>ii</sub></em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2<em>p</em></sup>/<em><sub>n</sub></em>.</p>
</div></div>

		
	<p>Note that high leverage does <strong>not</strong> mean that there is anything 
		wrong with an observation &mdash; only that its explanatory variables are 'unusual' 
		in some way that <strong>could</strong> unduely influence the results.</p>
