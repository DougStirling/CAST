<p class="heading">Looking for outliers and influence</p>
  <p>Detection of outliers is clearly important when fitting multiple regression 
		models. They may correspond to incorrectly recorded values or individuals 
		that are different enough from the rest to warrant separate analysis.</p>
	<p>High leverage is also important, even though it does not necessarily mean 
		that anything is wrong with the multiple regression model. A high-leverage 
		point could potentially have undue influence on the conclusions and we should 
		be aware if our conclusions hang on a single observation.</p>
	<p>In simple linear models, outliers, high leverage and influential points can 
		usually be seen in a scatterplot of the raw data, so the complication of evaluating 
		and plotting externally studentised residuals, leverages and measures of influence 
		is less important. However when there are two explanatory variables, it is 
		much harder to simply 'look at the raw data' and this is impossible if there 
		are three or more explanatory variables.</p>
	<p>Examination of externally studentised residuals, leverages and a measure 
		of influence is therefore important. These may be shown on a dot plot or in 
		a scatterplot against fitted values.</p>

	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Examples</p>
		<p>For each of the following data sets, externally studentised residuals, 
			leverages and DFITS are shown in stacked dot plots. Carefully examine the 
			plots, clicking on crosses to see corresponding values of the other measures, 
			then read the conclusions.</p>

Of the three seedlings with high leverage, only one is associated with a fairly high residual and therefore a high DFITS.

    <p>Since there are only two explanatory variables, you can click <strong>Peek 
			at data</strong> to see the raw data in a 3-dimensional scatterplot. For 
			models with more than two explanatory variables that you will meet in later 
			chapters, this will not be possible.</p>
