<p>When there is a finite number of possible outcomes and all are equally likely, 
it is relatively easy to find the probability of any event &mdash; the probability 
is simply the proportion of possible outcomes for which the event occurs.</p>
<p>The exercise below seems more complicated since it involves <strong>two</strong> 
items selected from a finite population. This can be done in two different ways, 
depending on whether the first item is replaced in the population before the second 
is selected. (When sampling without replacement, the same item cannot be selected 
twice.) However the different pairs that are 'legal' are all equally likely, so 
again we only need to find the proportion of these pairs for which the required 
event occurs.</p>

<p>Read the question below carefully. In particular, you must decide whether the 
two items are sampled with or without replacement &mdash; when sampling without replacement, 
the diagonal cells of the table are impossible and should be ignored when evaluating the probability.</p>
