<p>Probability describes situations where a random sample is selected from a population. It  is also used to model a 
	variety of <strong>other</strong> situations involving randomness.</p>
<p class=heading>Tennis match</p>
	<p>A simple model for a tennis match between two players, A and B, assumes that:</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<ul>
			<li>Probability of A winning  serve = π<sub>1</sub></li>
			<li>Probability of B winning  serve = π<sub>2</sub></li>
			<li>The results of successive points are independent</li>
			<li>The standard years of tennis</li>
		</ul>
	</div></div>
	<p>A more complex model might introduce more parameters to relax the assumption of independence.</p>
	<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
	<p>For any values of  π<sub>1</sub> and  π<sub>2</sub>, we could randomly generate the results of successive points until a match was complete.</p>
	<p>This generates an <strong>instance</strong> of the model and is called a <strong>simulation</strong>.</p>
