<p>When there are a finite number of possible outcomes and all are equally likely, 
it is relatively easy to find the probability of any event &mdash; the probability 
is simply the proportion of possible outcomes for which the event occurs.</p>
<p>Random outcomes that are equally likely are a critical component of many games 
of chance.</p>
<div class="diagram">

<p>There are two types of question that may be asked in the exercise below.</p>

<ul>
<li>In one type of question, two dice are rolled and a table shows the 36 possible combinations 
of values.</li>
<li>In the other type of question, one card is picked from a standard pack of playing cards 
and the table shows all 52 combinations of suit and card value.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both variations, read the question carefully to determine which of the equally 
likely outcomes are being referred to, and type their probability in the answer 
box.</p>
