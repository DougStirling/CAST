<p class="heading">Interpreting a graphical summary of a sample</p>

<p>There is sample-to-sample variability in summary displays of samples from a population.
However in any practical situation we only have a single data set (sample),
so how can we use this knowledge of sample-to-sample variability?
</p>

<p>We can assess features such as outliers, clusters or skewness in a data set 
by examining how often they appear in random samples from a population <strong>without</strong> 
such features. In particular, we can examine variability in samples from a normal 
distribution that closely matches the shape of the data set. </p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Skewness of holiday home rental data"> 
<p class="heading">Holiday home rental</p>
<p>The diagram below describes <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('displayInterp3')">monthly 
rentals</a> for 41 houses in a holiday resort. </p>

<div class="centred">

<p>The top half of the diagram shows a box plot and jittered dot plot of the rental 
data. There is an indication of skewness (a long tail to the distribution on the 
right). Does this indicate that rentals in the resort have a skew distribution 
or could it be simply a result of sampling from a symmetric population? </p>

<p>We examine the variability of similar displays from a symmetric normal distribution 
with similar centre and spread to the data. (The distribution's mean (2378) and 
standard deviation (1053) equal those of the data.) The bottom half of the display 
shows one such random sample from this normal population. Click <strong>Take sample</strong> 
a few times to observe the sample-to-sample variability of the sample displays. 
</p>

<p>Observe that there is rarely as much of an impression of skewness as that shown 
by the box plot of the actual data. Since this degree of skewness is unlikely 
if the population is a symmetric normal one, we can conclude that there is strong 
evidence that monthly rentals in the resort have a skew distribution. </p>
