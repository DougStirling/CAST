<p class="heading notPrinted">Repetitions of  a simulation</p>
	<p>Repeating a simulation and observing the 
		variability in the results can give insight into the randomness of the system's 
		behaviour.</p>
	<p class=heading>Model for sport league</p>
	<p>Consider a sports league of 10 teams in which each team plays each other twice and:</p>

<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;Points from a match =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td style="border-left:1px solid #000000">3 &nbsp;if team wins<br>&nbsp;1 &nbsp;if team draws<br>0 &nbsp;if team loses</td></tr>
</table></div>

	<p>We will model the league with a simple model for the results of individual matches. In it, team A has over twice the probability of winning than losing, but all other teams are equally matched.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The results of all matches are independent</li>
		<li>P(draw) = 0.2 in all matches</li>
		<li>P(team A wins its matches) = 0.55 and P(A loses) = 0.25</li>
		<li>All other teams are equally matched with P(win) = P(lose) = 0.4.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=heading>Simulation</p>
	<p>This model can be used to randomly generate the results of all 90 matches in the league.</p>

	<p>Repeating the simulation 100 times gives the following results:</p>

	<p>Despite team A being so much better than the other teams, the simulation shows that it has little more than 50% chance of ending the season on top of the league.</p>
