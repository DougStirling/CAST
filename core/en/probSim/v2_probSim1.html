<p class=heading>Modelling other situations with probability</p>
<p>Probability can be used to model many different types of situation involving randomness.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'probSim', 'simulation', '490', '404');</script>

<p>The mechanism will be clarified in the example below.</p>

<div class="diagram">

<p class=heading>Women's tennis match</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'probSim', 'tennis', '466', '290');</script>

</div>

<p>In practice, we would rarely be interested in displaying as much detail in 
a simulation (except perhaps when checking that we have programmed the rules of 
the match properly!). We are usually interested in only one or two outcomes  (such as the identity of the winner or the total number of sets played in the match) 
and only these summaries need be displayed from each run of the simulation.</p>
