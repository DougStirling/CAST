<p>The simulation on the previous page showed that there is considerable variability in the league table at the end of a season even if all teams are equally matched. Simulating league tables with evenly matched teams shows the amount of variability that could be <strong>expected</strong> at the end of season.</p>
<p>This provides a way to assess whether an <strong>actual</strong> league table might be explained simply by natural variability of teams with equal ability.</p>

<p>Simulations   with evenly matched teams will be used to help assess whether skill was evident in the 2013/14 season of the English Premier Soccer League.</p>
