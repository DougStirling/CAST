<p class=heading>HIV infection rates</p>
	<p>Researchers in the late 1980s collected data from a sample of 4,955 homosexual 
		men in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. We can estimate the proportion infected by the HIV virus in <strong>all</strong> homosexual men in these four cities with the <strong>sample</strong> proportion of infected men (1,883 out of  4,955)</p>

<p class=heading>Ewes  in region</p>
	<p>An official from the Ministry of Agriculture wants to estimate the average 
		number of ewes in a region's farms that are available for lambing in the 
		spring. Data were collected from a random sample of 100 farms from the 3,535 in the region.</p>
	<p>There was a total of 26,360 ewes in the  sampled farms, so the mean 
		number of ewes per farm was 263.6. This provides an <strong>estimate</strong> of the average 
	  in the <strong>whole</strong> region,</p>

	<p>It also allows us to estimate   the <strong>total</strong> number of ewes
in the region,</p>

	<p class=heading>Comparing beers</p>
	<p>A brewery wishes to assess the effect of an additive on the alcohol content of its
		premium beer. Several batches are brewed, both with and without the additive, and the
		alcohol content of each batch is recorded.</p>
	<p>Here there are two underlying populations &mdash; distributions describing the alcohol content of beer with and without the additive. The shapes of these distributions could potentially differ in various ways, but the brewer is mostly interested in whether the additive changes the <strong>mean</strong> alcohol content:</p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/equalMeans.gif" width="409" height="158"> </p>
	<p>The sample means provide estimates of the corresponding population means 
		and are the basis for answering the question. </p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The difference in sample means is an estimate of the difference 
					between the unknown population means.</p>
