<p class=heading>Inference about a population</p>
	<p>Data  are usually collected to provide information about some 
		<strong>population or process underlying the data</strong>. The data are often modelled as a <strong>random sample </strong>from 
		this population.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/d_dental.gif" width="550" height="275" class="summaryPict"></p>
	<p>More generally, inference is applicable to <strong>any</strong> situation where 
		data are obtained through a random mechanism. We may understand some aspects of 
		the process that generated the data (our <strong>model</strong> for the data-collection 
		process), but other aspects of this process must usually be estimated from data 
		that have been collected &mdash; inference.</p>
