<p class="heading">Error in an estimate</p>

  <p>When we use a summary statistic from a random sample to estimate a population 
		parameter, the estimate will usually not be exactly the same as the parameter.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The difference between the estimate and the target parameter 
					is called the <span class="bold red">error</span>  in 
					the estimate.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>For example, if the sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, is used to estimate a population mean, <span class="black">µ</span>, the error in this estimate is</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;<img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="black">µ</span></p>
	<p>If a sample proportion, <span class="em black">p</span> ,  is used to 
		estimate a population proportion, <span class="black">π</span>, 
		the estimate's error  is</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;<span class="em black">p</span>  - <span class="black">π</span></p>

<p class=heading>Annual rainfall in Samaru, Nigeria</p>

	  <p>In most of Africa, the most important climatic variable is rainfall. Rainfall 
			is usually highly seasonal and failure of crops is normally associated with 
			late arrival of rain or low rainfall. A better understanding of the distribution 
			of rainfall can affect the crops that are grown and when they are planted.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>What is the mean annual rainfall in Samaru, Northern Nigeria?<strong> 
						</strong></p>
</div></div>

		<p>In other words, we want to <strong>estimate the population mean</strong> 
			of the annual rainfall.</p>
		<p>The stacked dot plot below shows the annual rainfall in Samaru, Northern 
			Nigeria between 1928 and 1983 and marks the mean of these 56 values.</p>

		<p class=eqn><img class="gif" width="398" height="127"></p>
		<p>We are not interested specifically in the years 1928 to 1983, but want 
			to understand the underlying 'population' distribution of rainfalls in order 
			to predict what is likely to happen in the future. Assuming that there is 
			no climate change (or that climate change is negligible compared to the 
			year-to-year variation in rainfall),&nbsp;...</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>...&nbsp;we <strong><strong>estimate</strong> 
						that the population mean rainfall in Samaru is 1068.1&nbsp;mm</strong>.<strong> 
						</strong></p>
</div></div>

		<p>However our estimate of 1068.1 mm is only based on a sample of 56 values 
			so there is likely to be an error in this estimate.</p>
	</div>
	
  <p class="heading">How accurate is the estimate?</p>
  
  <p>In the example above, we used a sample statistic to estimate of an unknown 
		population parameter.</p>
		
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How big is the error likely to be?</p>
</div></div>

	
  <p>The remainder of this chapter introduces some methods to describe the accuracy 
    of estimates (and equivalently, the likely size of the resulting errors).</p>
