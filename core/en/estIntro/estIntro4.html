<p class="heading">Error in an estimate</p>

<p>When we use a summary statistic from a random sample to estimate a population 
	parameter, the estimate will usually not be exactly the same as the parameter.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The difference between the estimate and the target parameter 
				is called the <span class="bold red">error</span>  in 
				the estimate.</p>
</div></div>

<p>For example, if the sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, is used to estimate a population mean, <span class="black">µ</span>, the error in this estimate is</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;<img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="black">µ</span></p>
<p>If a sample proportion, <span class="em black">p</span> ,  is used to 
	estimate a population proportion, <span class="black">π</span>, 
	the estimate's error  is</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;<span class="em black">p</span>  
	- <span class="black">π</span></p>

	<p class=heading>Silkworm poisoning</p>

	<p>Silkworms must be killed after spinning their cocoons since the silk is 
		damaged when the moths break free. Heat is often used to kill the caterpillars, 
		but researchers performed experiments to investigate the toxic action of 
		arsenic. As part of their research, the survival time of fourth-instar silkworm 
		larvae weighing between 0.41 and 0.45 grams was examined after they were 
		given 0.10 mg of sodium arsenate per gram of body weight.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>What is the mean survival time of the larvae with this dose 
					of sodium arsenate?</p>
</div></div>

	
	<p> In other words, we want to <strong>estimate the population mean</strong> 
		of the survival times.</p>
	<p>The experiment was conducted on 80 fourth-instar silkworm larvae and their 
		survival times (seconds) were recorded. The stacked dot plot below shows 
		the survival times.</p>

	
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/silkwormMean.gif" width="396" height="136"></p>
	<p>We are not interested in the specific 80 silkworms, but want to understand 
		the underlying 'population' distribution of survival times. Assuming that 
		these silkworms are a random sample from this wider population,&nbsp;...</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>...&nbsp;we <strong><strong>estimate</strong> 
					that the population mean survival time is 272.6 seconds</strong>.<strong> 
					</strong></p>
</div></div>

	
	<p>However our estimate of 272.6 seconds is only based on a sample of 80 observations 
		so there is likely to be an error in this estimate.</p>
	
</div>
<p class="heading">How accurate is the estimate?</p>

<p>In the example above, we used a sample statistic to estimate of an unknown 
	population parameter.</p>
	
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How big is the error likely to be?</p>
</div></div>


<p>The remainder of this chapter introduces some methods to describe the accuracy 
	of estimates (and equivalently, the likely size of the resulting errors).</p>
