<p class="heading">Error in an estimate</p>

  <p>When we use a summary statistic from a random sample to estimate a population 
		parameter, the estimate will usually not be exactly the same as the parameter.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The difference between the estimate and the target parameter 
					is called the <span class="bold red">error</span>  in 
					the estimate.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>For example, if the sample mean, <img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">, is used to estimate a population mean, <span class="black">µ</span>, the error in this estimate is</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;<img src="../../images/symbol.xBar.png" width="10" height="10" align="baseline">&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="black">µ</span></p>
	<p>If a sample proportion, <span class="em black">p</span> ,  is used to 
		estimate a population proportion, <span class="black">π</span>, 
		the estimate's error  is</p>
	<p class=eqn><span class="em black">error</span>  &nbsp;= &nbsp;<span class="em black">p</span>  - <span class="black">π</span></p>

		<p class=heading>Assets-to-liabilities ratio</p>

	  <p>Researchers in Greece determined the assets-to-liabilities ratios of a 
			sample of 68 healthy companies. The aim of the study was to compare these 
			healthy companies with another 33 companies that had just failed, but we 
			will only consider the healthy companies in this chapter of CAST.</p>
		<p>Low assets-to-liabilities ratios are usually regarded as undesirable for 
			a company.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>What is the mean assets-to-liabilities ratio for healthy 
						companies such as these?</p>
</div></div>

		<p>In other words, we want to <strong>estimate the population mean</strong> 
			of the assets-to-liabilities ratio in the wider population of similar Greek 
			companies.</p>
		<p>The stacked dot plot below shows the assets-to-liabilities ratios for the 
			68 companies in the study and marks their mean.</p>

		<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/assetLiabilitiesMean.gif" width="396" height="136"></p>
		<p>We are not interested in the specific 68 companies that were sampled, but 
			want to understand the underlying 'population' distribution of assets-to-liabilities 
			ratios in all such companies.</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We therefore <strong><strong>estimate</strong> 
						that the population mean <strong>assets-to-liabilities ratios</strong> 
						for this type of company is 1.726</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

		<p>However our estimate of 1.726 is only based on a sample of 68 values so 
			there is likely to be an error in this estimate.</p>
	</div>
	
  <p class="heading">How accurate is the estimate?</p>
  
  <p>In the example above, we used a sample statistic to estimate of an unknown 
		population parameter.</p>
		
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>How big is the error likely to be?</p>
</div></div>

	
  <p>The remainder of this chapter introduces some methods to describe the accuracy 
    of estimates (and equivalently, the likely size of the resulting errors).</p>
