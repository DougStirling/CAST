<p class=heading>Inference</p>

  <p>Most data sets are collected to provide information about some 
		population or process underlying the data whose characteristics 
		cannot be directly measured. The main aim is to <strong>generalise from the 
		data to the underlying population</strong>.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The use of data (e.g. a random sample) to obtain 
					information about an underlying population is called <strong>inference</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<p class=heading>Inference and models</p>

<p>In the examples above, the data are modelled as a <strong>random sample from 
some underlying population</strong>. Indeed, the most common applications of inference 
deal with random samples.</p>
<p>More generally, inference is applicable to <strong>any</strong> situation where 
data are obtained through a random mechanism. We may understand some aspects of 
the process that generated the data (our <strong>model</strong> for the data-collection 
process), but other aspects of this process must usually be estimated from data 
that have been collected &mdash; inference.</p>
