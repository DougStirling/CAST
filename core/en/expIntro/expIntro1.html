<p class="heading">Sample from a finite population</p>
<p>Data sometimes comes from a selection of individuals (e.g. people, animals, trees or plots of land) who are sampled to be 'representative' of some population. The sampling mechanism is most easily understood when there is a finite population of individuals from which the sample is selected.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A random sample of apples is selected for testing from a crate delivered to a supermarket.</li>
  <li>A random sample of farmers in a region is sent a questionnaire about the crops grown.</li>
  <li>An accountant selects a random sample of the unpaid invoices in a company.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the population is finite, the  sample is called a <strong>survey</strong>. Typical questions that might be asked using the  data are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What proportion of apples are bruised?</li>
  <li>What is the average area that farmers plant with maize?</li>
  <li>What is the total amount of the company's unpaid invoices?</li>
</ul>
<p class="heading">Sample from an infinite population</p>
<p>In other situations, there is no concrete finite population from which the data arose, but we model the data as a random sample from some <strong>infinite</strong> underlying population.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The lifetimes of 50 lightbulbs are recorded. They are modelled as a random sample from a hypothetical population of lifetimes of all possible lightbulbs manufactured in the same way.</li>
  <li>The yields are recorded from 20 tomato plants grown in a 'standard' environment. They are modelled as a random sample from 'all possible' tomato plants of this variety when grown in the same environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all sampling situations, the aim is descriptive &mdash; the sample data are used to describe characteristics of the underlying population.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What proportion of light bulbs will last more than 2,000 hours?</li>
  <li>What is the average yield of this type of tomato?</li>
  </ul>
<p class="heading">Samples from two or more populations</p>
<p>In many studies, samples are taken from two or more populations. Again the underlying population may be finite or infinite.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A large class of students is separated into smaller groups for tutorials. Two students are selected from each tutorial group and asked about the course.</li>
  <li>Five farmers are sent a questionnaire from each of the ten villages in a region.</li>
  <li>Twenty maize plants of each of three varieties are grown in a 'standard' environment. The yields are modelled as random samples from populations of yields of 'all possible' maize plants of the three varieties grown in the same environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>This type of survey is often called a <strong>stratified sample</strong>. The aim may be to combine  information from the separate samples into a single summary describing  all populations together, or to describe differences between the populations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do farmers growing maize on hilly fields have different yields than those growing maize on flat land?</li>
  <li>Is the weight of a type of mouse related to the rainfall of the region in which it is found?</li>
  <li>Do farmers giving their cattle a drench have cows with higher body weight?</li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Observational studies</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>Data obtained by sampling from finite or infinite populations are collectively called <strong>observational</strong> data. </p>
</div></div>
<p>The aim of observational studies is  descriptive &mdash; the resulting data will be used to describe the characteristics of the populations from which the data are sampled.</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p class="heading">Maize grown in a country</p>
	<p>Consider a survey that is conducted to investigate patterns and trends in the use of different maize varieties in a country. Random samples of farmers are selected from different regions and are asked to complete a questionnaire about the varieties of maize grown, estimated yields, farm size and other personal information such as age, income and education. The researchers can also determine climatic information for each farm from national databases.</p>
	<p>The data might be used to answer the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What proportion of farmers use each maize variety?</li>
		<li>Are there regional differences in the use of maize varieties?</li>
		<li>Are different varieties used in  farms with low rainfall?</li>
		<li>Is the variety used by a farmer associated with his age or education?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the survey is repeated annually, the data can also be used to investigate trends in the use of the different maize varieties.</p>
