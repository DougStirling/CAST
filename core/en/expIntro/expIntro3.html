<p class="heading">More subtle  mis-interpretations of relationships</p>
<p>It is common for laymen (and even researchers) to mistake association between two variables in a survey as meaning that there is a causal relationship.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In a survey of farms, it was found that maize growing on hilly fields had lower yield than maize growing on flat land.</li>
  <li>In a wildlife survey, it was found that the weights of a type of mouse were lower in regions with low rainfall.</li>
  <li>In a survey of farmers, it was found that those giving their cattle a drench had cows with higher body weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible explanations that do not rely on a causal relationship are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Farmers growing maize on hilly fields may have lower yields than those growing maize on flat land because they cannot afford to buy better seeds.</li>
  <li>Mice in regions with low rainfall may have lower weights because they are younger than those in regions with high rainfall.</li>
  <li>Farmers giving their cattle a drench may take better care of their animals in other ways too, so their higher body weight may be caused by better feed rather than the drench itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>With observational data, it is important to think carefully about possible other causes for two variables to appear related.</p>

<p class="heading">Eagle flight</p>
	<p>The distances that eagles fly varies greatly and a biologist investigates whether 
	  flight distances depend on the weights of the birds. In a study that extended 
	  over twelve months, 120 different eagles were each tagged with a radio transmitter 
	  for a period of two weeks. The average flight length (km per day) and weight (kg) 
	  of each eagle were recorded. A scatterplot of these measurements is shown below. </p>

	<p>The marginal relationship between <em>flight length</em> and <em>weight</em> shows a positive correlation, so it might be taken to imply that heavy eagles 
	  tend to fly further than light eagles, and a naive biologist might try to 
	  explain this in terms of their body mass providing the energy necessary 
	  to extend their range.</p>
	<p>However this conclusion is flawed. The data were collected at different 
	  times during the year, and <em>season</em> is a third variable that affects 
	  both the weights of the birds and the distances that they fly.</p>

    <p class="heading">Cabbage pests and diseases</p>
    <p>A plant researcher is investigating the relationship between different diseases 
    and pests of vegetable plants. The following data come from a sample of 112 vegetable 
    gardens in which cabbages were grown organically. The contingency table shows 
    the gardens that were classified as being infested with cabbage caterpillars and 
    club root (a disease that leads to swollen roots). </p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../causal/images/cabbageDisease.gif" width="333" height="115"> </p>
  <p>A larger proportion of gardens that are clear of club root are also clear of 
    cabbage caterpillars. Similarly, a larger proportion of gardens that are not infested 
    by cabbage caterpillars are also free from club root. </p>
  <p>There are three possible interpretations of this relationship between cabbage 
    caterpillars and club root. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Club root directly affects cabbage caterpillars. <span class="black">Perhaps 
      the butterflies are attracted to lay eggs on diseased plants.</span> <br>
      &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Cabbage caterpillars directly affect club root. <span class="black">Perhaps 
      infestation by cabbage caterpillars weakens the plants and makes them more susceptible 
      to disease.</span> <br>
      &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Neither cabbage caterpillar infestation nor club root affects the other. <span class="black">For example, the different vegetable gardens will be 
      in areas with different soils and different micro-climates. It is possible 
      that some gardens grow weaker plants that are therefore more susceptible 
      to both infestations. Changing one variable would not affect the other.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The data cannot help to resolve the issue of causation so it would be incorrect 
    to report any causal relationship from these data.</p>
