<p class="heading">Sample from a finite population</p>
<p>Data sometimes comes from a selection of individuals (e.g. people, animals, trees or plots of land) who are sampled to be 'representative' of some population. When selected is from a <strong>finite</strong> population of individuals, the  sample is called a <strong>survey</strong>.</p>
<p>Typical questions that might be asked about the underlying population are about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The proportion of individuals in some category</li>
  <li>The average value of some measurement</li>
  <li>The total of some measurement over the whole population</li>
</ul>
<p class="heading">Sample from an infinite population</p>
<p>In other situations, there is no concrete finite population from which the data arose. We might however model the data as a random sample from some <strong>infinite</strong> underlying population. We are again often interested in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The proportion of individuals in some category</li>
	<li>The average value of some measurement</li>
</ul>

	<div class="boxed">
		<p>Data obtained by sampling from finite or infinite populations are collectively called <strong>observational</strong> data. </p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>The aim of observational studies is  descriptive &mdash; the resulting data will be used to describe the characteristics of the populations from which the data are sampled.</p>
<p class="heading">Samples from two or more populations</p>
<p>In many studies, samples are taken from two or more populations. This type of survey is often called a <strong>stratified sample</strong>. The aim may be to combine  information from the separate samples into a single summary describing  all populations together, or to describe differences between the populations.</p>
