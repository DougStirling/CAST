<p class="heading">Conclusions from experiments</p>
<p>The method of data collection has a major influence on whether a relationship 
  can be interpreted as causal.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>In an observational study, there is often the potential for a lurking 
    variable to underlie  an observed relationship. </p>
</div></div>
<p>In contrast, it is possible to conclude from a well-designed experiment  that the controlled variable does affect the response.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>In a well designed experiment, the observed relationships will be causal. </p>
</div></div>
<p>Note however that the experiment must be well designed in order to come to conclusions about causal relationships. In a <strong>badly</strong> designed experiment, lurking variables 
  can still cause difficulties with interpretation.</p>
  <div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Vitamin C and colds</p>
<p>To test whether vitamin C reduces the risk of catching a cold, a 1961 French 
	study involved 279 skiers over two periods of 5-7 days. Skiers in one group of 
	139 were given 1 gram ascorbic acid (vitamin C) per day whereas those in the other 
	group were given a tablet that looked similar but had no active ingredient (called 
	a <strong>placebo</strong>). None of the skiers knew which of the treatments they 
	had received.</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<th>&nbsp;</th>
		<th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
		<th>&nbsp;&nbsp;No cold&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th align="left">Ascorbic acid</th>
		<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-left:1px solid #999999;">17</td>
		<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;">122</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th align="left">Placebo</th>

		<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;">109</td>
	</tr>
</table></div>
<p>From this table, we can calculate that 12% of those who were given vitamin C got colds and 22% of those given the placebo got colds. A statistical test comparing these percentages gives moderately strong evidence of a difference (p-value = 0.027). From the design of the experiment, we can conclude:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>There is moderately strong evidence that use of vitamin C reduces the probability of getting a cold for skiers.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Comb weight of chicks</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted as part of an investigation into the effect of two hormones on the growth of male chicks. Twenty two chicks were used in the experiment and half were selected at random and given testosterone, the other half receiving dehydroandrosterone. The comb weights of the chicks (mg)  are shown below.</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

<p>A statistical test shows that there is very strong evidence that the mean comb weight of the chicks getting testosterone is higher than that of the chicks getting dehydroandrosterone. From the design of the experiment, we can conclude that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>There is very strong evidence that giving chicks testosterone results in heavier combs than dehydroandrosterone.</p>
