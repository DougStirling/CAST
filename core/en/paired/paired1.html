<p class="heading">Using information about the experimental units</p>
<p>In a completely randomised experiment,  variability in the experimental units lowers the accuracy of the estimated  factor effects. Although it is occasionally possible to conduct an experiment with very similar experimental units, some variation in the experimental units is unavoidable in most experiments.</p>
<p>If we have information about differences between the experimental units before the start of the experiment, we can use this information to design an experiment that more accurately estimates  the  factor effects.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The main way to improve accuracy involves grouping the experimental units into <strong>blocks</strong> of similar units.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Randomised block design</p>
<p>An efficient way to conduct an experiment in which the experimental units are grouped into blocks is to separately conduct a completely randomised experiment within each block. The results from the different blocks are combined in the analysis of the data.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Since randomisation occurs separately within each block, this is called a <strong>randomised block</strong> design.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Blocks of size two &mdash; pairs</p>
<p>Analysis of randomised block experiments in their full generality is fairly difficult, so we will start with a special case whose analysis is much easier to understand. This section restricts attention to:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed" style="text-align:left">
	<ul>
		<li>Experimental units that naturally separate into <strong>pairs</strong>  of similar units.</li>
		<li>Experiments with a single controlled factor that has <strong>two levels.</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</div></div>
<p>In a randomised block design, both treatments are used within each pair and randomisation involves randomly deciding which of the two units gets which of the two treatments.</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p class="heading">Illustration of randomisation</p>
	<p>Consider an experiment that is conducted to assess whether a new exercise programme 
		for broken legs aids recovery over the standard method. A group of 20 children 
		with broken legs is used (the experimental units) and the response measurement 
		will be the strength of the leg muscles three weeks after the break.</p>

	<p>In a completely randomised experiment, 10 children are randomly picked from 
		the 20 for the new exercise programme. Click <strong>Randomise</strong> to show 
		this.</p>
	<p>Select <strong>Randomised block (paired)</strong> from the pop-up menu to group the children into  pairs with the 
		same gender and similar weight and muscular strength at the start of the experiment.(in vertical columns). Click <strong>Randomise</strong> to randomly select one child from each pair to get the new exercise programme.</p>
	<p class="heading">Twin studies</p>
	<p>Much of the variability between animals and people is caused by differences in genetic makeup. Dizygotic (fraternal) twins have the same parents and are therefore genetically similar. However  monozygotic  (identical) twins have  identical genes and there is even less variation between their characteristics. Many animal experiments are conducted with identical twins since the genetic similarity within each pair of twins allows the effect of treatments to be more accurately estimated.</p>
	<p>Human studies have also been conducted with identical twins. The table below shows the IQs of ten pairs of twins who were raised apart, one in a 'good' environment and the other in a 'poor' one. 
		It can be assumed that the twins were randomly placed in these two environments.</p>
