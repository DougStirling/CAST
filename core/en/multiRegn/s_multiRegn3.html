<p class="heading">Marginal and conditional relationships</p>
	<p>In a linear model that predicts a response from several explanatory variables, the least squares coefficient associated with any explanatory variable describes its effect on the response <strong>if all other variables are held constant</strong>. 
		This is also called the variable's <strong>conditional effect</strong> on 
		the response.</p>
	<p>This may be very different from the size and even the sign of the coefficient when a linear model is fitted with <strong>only that single explanatory variable</strong>. This simple linear model describes the <strong>marginal</strong> relationship between the response and that variable.</p>
	<p class="heading">Example</p>
	<p>In a model for predicting the percentage body fat of men, the best model (as determined by least squares) in a simple model with <em>weight</em>, is</p>
	<p class="eqn"><em>Predicted body fat</em>   =   -10.00  +  0.162 <em>Weight</em></p>
	<p>However if we add <em>Abdomen circumference</em> to the model, the best values for the coefficients are</p>
	<p class="eqn"><em>Predicted body fat</em>   =   -41.35  -  0.136 <em>Weight</em>  +  0.915 <em>Abdomen</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>For each 1lb extra <em>Weight</em>, men have, on average, 0.162% <strong>more</strong> body fat.</li>
		<li>For each 1lb extra <em>Weight</em>, men have, on average, 0.136% <strong>less</strong> body fat <strong>than others with the same <em>Abdomen circumference</em></strong>.</li>
	</ul>
