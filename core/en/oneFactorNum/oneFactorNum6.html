<p class="heading">Equivalence of models</p>  
  <p>It is important to think of models in terms of their flexibility for modelling 
		the response mean <strong>corresponding to the observed data</strong>. For 
		a numerical explanatory variable, <em>X</em>, it is only the model mean <strong>at 
		the x-values used in the experiment</strong> that matters. Although we may 
		use a linear or quadratic model to predict the response at intermediate x-values, 
		for assessing how well the model fits the actual experimental data, only the 
		predictions at the used x-values matters.</p>
	<p class="heading">Explanatory variables with two levels</p>
	<p>If the explanatory variable is numerical but only two x-values are used in 
		the experiment, the linear model allows complete flexibility in the values 
		for the response mean at these two x-values. (Both models have two unknown parameters.)</p>
	<p>The 2-level model that treats these two x-values as categorical has identical 
		flexibility and is equivalent with respect to the fit of the model.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A numerical explanatory variable with 2 levels 
				can be equivalently modelled as categorical.</p>
</div></div>

		
	<p>Conversely,</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A categorical variable with 2 levels could equivalently 
				be coded as 0/1 and treated as numerical.</p>
</div></div>

		
	<p class="heading">Explanatory variables with three levels</p>
	<p>In a similar way, if an experiment involves a numerical explanatory variable 
		that only takes three distinct values, a quadratic model has complete flexibility 
		to give any mean responses at these three x-values. (Both models have three unknown parameters.)</p>
	<p>The 3-level model that treats the three x-values as categorical is identical 
		to the quadratic model in its flexibility and fit.</p>

		<p class="heading">Effect of copper on aquatic animals</p>
		
    <p>An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of copper concentrations 
      in water on the lifetime of a small aquatic animal, <em>daphnia magna</em>. 
      Fifteen daphnia were kept in separate containers and were randomly split 
      into groups getting 0, 20 or 40 micrograms/litre of copper. Their lifetimes 
      (days) were recorded. (One container was contaminated so only 14 lifetimes 
      could be analysed.)</p>
