<p class="heading">Six factors</p>  
  <p>When six or more factors are used in an experiment with 16 runs, it is impossible 
		to avoid confounding 2-factor interactions with other 2-factor interactions. 
		However designs for up to eight factors can be constructed in which the main 
		effects are not confounded with any 2-factor interactions. These are therefore 
		resolution IV designs.</p>
	<p>To design a 2<sup>6-2</sup> fractional factorial experiment for 6 factors, 
		we again start with a complete 2<sup>4</sup> factorial design for factors 
		A, B, C and D. The levels of factors E and F should be given by 3-factor interactions 
		between A, B, C and D. For example,</p>
	<p class="eqn">E &nbsp; = &nbsp; ABC</p>
	<p class="eqn">F &nbsp; = &nbsp; BCD</p>
	<p>Note that:</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p style="text-align:left">If E or F is confounded with the 4-factor interaction ABCD, 
				it is impossible to avoid confounding at least one main effect with a 
				2-factor interaction.<strong> Both additional main effects 
				should be confounded with 3-factor interactions.</strong></p>
</div></div>

  <p class="heading">Seven factors</p>
	<p>Again the three additional factors, E, F and G should be confounded with 
		3-factor interactions between A, B, C and D. Any 3-factor interactions can 
		be chosen. For example,</p>
	<p class="eqn">E &nbsp; = &nbsp; ABC</p>
	<p class="eqn">F &nbsp; = &nbsp; BCD</p>
	<p class="eqn">G&nbsp; = &nbsp; ACD</p>
	<p>This is again a resolution IV design since no main effects are confounded 
		with 2-factor interactions (though several 2-factor interactions are again 
		confounded with each other).</p>
	<p class="heading">Eight factors</p>
	<p>In order to get a resolution IV design (no main effects confounded with 2-factor 
		interactions), it is necessary to define the levels four additional factors 
		from the four 3-factor interactions between A, B, C and D,</p>
	<p class="eqn">E &nbsp; = &nbsp; ABC</p>
	<p class="eqn">F &nbsp; = &nbsp; BCD</p>
	<p class="eqn">G&nbsp; = &nbsp; ACD</p>
	<p class="eqn">H&nbsp; = &nbsp; ABD</p>
	<div class="diagram">

    <p>The red, green and blue heading rows are used to specify the terms from

			of factors E, F and G. <strong>Click</strong> in these heading rows to set 
			the levels of E, F and G.</p>
		<p>For any definition of E, F and G, the columns of interactions listed in 
			the heading are all confounded with each other. Observe that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If E, F and G are defined from any 3-factor interactions between A, 
				B, C and D, the main effects are not confounded with any 2-factor interactions.</li>
			<li>If any of E, F and G are defined from the ABCD interaction, at least 
				one main effect is confounded with a 2-factor interaction.</li>
