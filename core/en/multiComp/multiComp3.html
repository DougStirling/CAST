<p class="heading">Controlling for multiple pairwise comparisons</p>
  <p>In experiments with a factor that has several levels, there are many possible pairwise comparisons of levels. The Bonferroni correction could be used to increase the t-value that is used for each comparison, but the differences between the level means are highly correlated so this approach is too conservative.</p>
  <p>Statistical theory provides a better adjustment to fix the <strong>overall</strong> probability that <strong>no</strong> pairs of means will be found to differ if the factor has no effect on the response. For an experiment in which there are <em>r</em> replicates for each of the <em>g</em> factor levels (and hence <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>rg</em> experimental units), we should replace the pairwise maximum difference for significance,</p>

  <p>where <img src="../multiGroup/images/studentRangeConst.gif" width="29" height="24" align="absbottom"> 
    is a constant that can be looked up in tables of the <strong>studentised range 
    distribution</strong> or obtained from statistical software.</p>
	<p class="heading">Explanation</p>
	<p>The conventional two-sample interval is based on <strong>pairwise</strong> comparisons, but the studentised range interval fixes <strong>experiment-wise</strong> probabilities.</p>

			<td>This is the width of a 95% confidence interval for the difference between <strong>any two specific</strong> level means. It is therefore also the maximum difference  for them to be considered significantly different at the 5% significance level.</td>

There is therefore 95% probability that <strong>all</strong> level means will be closer to each other than this if the factor has no effect, and a 5% probability that at least one pair of level means will be further apart.</td>

		<p class="heading">Constants for multiple comparisons</p>
		<p>The diagram below calculates the constant <img src="../multiGroup/images/studentRangeConst.gif" width="29" height="24" align="absbottom"> 
			for multiple comparisons of all pairs of group means to give a 5% significance level
			for the multiple comparison.</p>

		<p>The constant's value depends on both the number of groups and on the number

	<p class="heading">Which group means are different?</p>
	<p>An approach that is often used to assess which group means differ is therefore 
		to first evaluate the interval,</p>
	<p class=eqn><img src="images/multipleComarison.gif" width="86" height="34"></p>
	<p>Since this interval is based on the width of a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the minimum and maximum level means, we can conclude that there is no evidence of a real difference between levels whose means differ by less than this. There is moderate evidence that levels whose means differ by more are really different. </p>
	<p>Using values of  <img src="../multiGroup/images/studentRangeConst.gif" width="29" height="24" align="absbottom"> from tables at  significance levels that are lower than 5% would increase the width of the interval; level means that were further apart would then give stronger evidence of a real difference between the underlying levels.</p>
