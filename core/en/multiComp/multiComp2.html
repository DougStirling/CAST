<p>Although the problems of applying multiple hypothesis tests are often ignored, there is one situation in which there is a commonly used correction.</p>
  <p class="heading">Factors with many levels</p>
  <p>Consider an experiment with a single factor that has several levels. For example, </p>
  <ul>
  	<li>An agricultural researcher conducts and experiment to compare the growth rates of 10 varieties of maize.</li>
 		<li>A consumer organisation tests the fat content of 12 brands of ice cream.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
  <p class=eqn><img src="images/levelMeans.gif" width="411" height="117"> </p>
  <p>Analysis of variance may conclude that all levels  do <strong>not</strong> have the same response means. We may then ask: </p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>Which of these levels differ from each other?</p>
  </div></div>
  <p class="heading">Pairwise comparisons</p>
  <p>Consider an experiment in which there are <em>r</em> replicates at each of the <em>g</em> levels (so the total number of experimental units is <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>rg</em>). To compare two specific levels, note that if the two levels are identical,  there is a 95% probability that their observed level means differ by more than</p>
  <p class=eqn><img src="images/twoGroupPlusMinus.gif" width="111" height="41"> </p>
  <p>where <em>t<sub>n-<em>g</em></sub></em> is such that 95% of the t distribution with <em>n</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>g</em> degrees of freedom is between Â±&nbsp;<em>t<sub>n-<em>g</em></sub></em>. (This is based on a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means.) We might therefore conclude that these two levels are different if their level means differ by more than this.</p>
  <p>When there are several factor levels, the problem is that there are many different pairs of levels that can be compared in this way.</p>

	<p>This introduces the problems described in the previous page. Even if all level means are identical,</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>If pairwise comparisons are made at the 5% significance level, there is much more than 5% probability that <strong>at least one pair</strong> of means will be significantly different. </p>
	</div></div>
<br>

	<div class="diagram"> 
		<p class="heading">Overall probability for several comparisons</p>
		<p>The diagram below calculates the  probability of finding <strong>at least one</strong> significant pairwise difference between the level means when each comparison has significance level 0.05 but all levels are identical.</p>

<p>When there are two levels, the true probability is 0.05, whatever the number 
	of replicates at each level.</p>
<p>Use the slider to increase the number of levels. Observe that:</p>
