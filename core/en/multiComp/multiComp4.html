<p class="heading">Multiple comparisons in randomised block designs</p>

  <p>A similar adjustment can be made to help assess which treatments differ in a randomised block design.</p>
  <p>If there are <em>g</em> treatments and <em>r</em> observations for each 
    treatment (so the total sample size is <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>rg</em>), 
   the <strong>overall</strong> probability is exactly 95% that 
		<strong>all</strong> pairwise differences between the treatment means 
		are less than</p>

  <p>if the factor has no effect on the response. In this formula,  <img src="images/studRangeSymbol.gif" width="24" height="24" align="absbottom"> 
    is a constant that can be looked up in tables of the <strong>studentised range 
  distribution</strong> or obtained from statistical software,  <em>s</em> is the best estimate of the error standard deviation,</p>

  <p>and the residual sum of squares has <em>df</em> degrees of freedom.</p>

    <p class="heading">Codeine and acupuncture for dental pain relief</p>

    <p>The diagram below shows the pain relief score in an experiment with 32 subjects who were 
      each given one of four treatments (combinations of codeine and acupuncture) to help relieve dental pain. 
      They were grouped into blocks of four according to an initial assessment 
      of their pain tolerance and the treatments were randomly allocated to the 
      four subjects in each block. (I.e. a randomised block design was used.)</p>

    <p>The diagram initially shows a band (red) whose width should cover all treatment 
			means with probability 95%, if we ignore the blocks that were used in the 
			experiment (groups of patients with similar prior assessment of pain tolerance). 
			Drag the red band and observe that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Placebo, Acupuncture and Codeine treatment means are within this 
				distance, so we could not conclude that there were any differences between 
				these treatments.</li>
			<li>The combined Codeine+Acupuncture treatment mean is much further from 
				the Placebo mean, so there would have been strong evidence that the combined 
				treatment was better than none.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However <span class="bold red">this analysis is wrong</span>  
			since the experiment was a randomised block experiment. Select <strong>Correct 
			analysis taking account of blocks</strong> from the pop-up menu. After taking 
			account of differences between the blocks, the residual unexplained variation 
			(and hence the mean residual sum of squares, <em>s</em>) is much lower, 
			so the red band that should cover all treatment means with probability 95% 
			is now much narrower. Drag the band and observe that:</p>
		
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is no evidence 
						of a difference between Acupuncture and Codeine on their own, but 
						strong evidence that all other pairs of treatments have different 
						mean pain relief scores.</p>
