<p class=heading>Interpreting the standard error</p>
	<p>The 70-95-100 rule-of-thumb provides a useful interpretation of the standard 
		error of an estimator. For all variables with fairly symmetrical bell-shaped 
		distributions,</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is approx 95% probability of being within 2 st devns 
					of the mean and it is almost certain that a value will be within 3 st 
					devns of the mean.</p>
</div></div>

	
		
	<p>Applying this to an estimator's error distribution and making the assumption 
		that the bias is zero (or at least small),</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>There is approx 95% probability that the error is within 2SE 
					of zero and it is almost certainly within 3SE of zero.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>Note that the term <em><strong>standard error</strong></em> is often abbreviated 
		to <em><strong>SE</strong></em>.</p>

    <p class="heading">Soluble sugar in plants</p>

		
    <p>In the example on the previous page, it was known that one type of analysis 
      of soluble sugar in plants gave glucose levels (mg/g dry weight) with the 
      following distribution.</p>
		
    <p class=eqn><em>X</em>&nbsp; ~ &nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">normal</font> (&mu;&nbsp;, &sigma; = 3) 
    </p>
    <p>A particular plant was tested 16 times, giving a sample mean of 137 mg 
      glucose per gram dry weight.</p>
		<p>On the previous page, we showed the full error distribution for this estimate. 
			We can get similar information from only the standard error of the estimate. 
			Since the sample size was <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;16, the standard error 
			of the estimate is</p>

<p>Our estimate (i.e. 137 mg/g 
            dry wt) has about 95% chance of being within 2SE = 1.5 of the true 
            glucose level for this plant and is almost certain to be within 3SE&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.25 
            of it.</p>
