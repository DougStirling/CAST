<p class="heading">Biased estimators</p>
	<p>In statistics, we mostly use estimators that are unbiased &mdash; their error 
		distributions are centred on zero. However you may sometimes meet estimators 
		that are biased &mdash; the mean of their error distribution (the <strong>bias</strong>) 
		is <strong>not</strong> zero.</p>
	<p>The diagram below shows the properties of the  mean and median of samples of size <em>n</em> = 16 from a skew population distribution. The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean, µ, but the median is a biased estimator &mdash; it usually underestimate µ. (This should be no surprise since the median is less than the mean in skew data sets with a long right tail.)</p>

	<p>Although bias is undesirable, a little bias may be acceptable in an estimator 
		if its standard error is also small.</p>
