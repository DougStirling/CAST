<p class="heading">Biased estimators</p>

<p>In statistics, we mostly use estimators that are unbiased &mdash; their error 
	distributions are centred on zero. However you may sometimes meet estimators 
	that are biased &mdash; the mean of their error distribution (the <strong>bias</strong>) 
	is <strong>not</strong> zero.</p>

<p>Although bias is undesirable, a little bias may be acceptable in an estimator 
	if its standard error is also small.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Estimating a skew distribution's mean">
	<p class="heading">Estimating the mean of a skew distribution</p>

	
	<p>The diagram below compares the error distributions of the sample mean and 
		median when estimating the population mean of a very skew distribution. 
		Such skew distributions are often appropriate for lifetimes of biological 
		organisms and manufactured products.</p>
	<p>For all distributions, whether or not they are skew, the sample mean is 
		an unbiased estimator of the population mean. However the sample mean is 
		further into the tail of a skew distribution than the median, so the sample 
		median tends to under-estimate the population mean &mdash; it has negative bias.</p>

	<p>The diagram above shows the error distributions for the sample mean and 
		the median. Observe that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Both estimators have similar standard errors</li>
		<li>The sample median is biased &mdash; the mean of its error distribution is 
			negative. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Observe also that when the sample size is large, the bias of the median 
		results in errors that are <strong>considerably</strong> further from zero.</p>
	<p class="gray">(Note: The error distribution shown for the mean 
		is exact, but that of the median is only approximate &mdash; the exact distribution 
		of the sample median is difficult to obtain.)</p>
