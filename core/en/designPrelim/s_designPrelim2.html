<p class=heading>What experimental units should be used?</p>
	<p>It is desirable for experimental units to be as similar as possible, so every
		attempt should be made to make the experimental units homogeneous.	</p>
	<p>Often however, the experimenter has little influence on the choice of experimental 
		units and must contend with whatever variability exists. Grouping them into block of similar units (and using a randomised block design) will make the results more accurate.</p>
	<p class="heading">What response variable should be recorded?</p>
	<p>In an experiment, there is sometimes a single obvious response measurement 
		from an experimental unit, but often there are several variables which can be considered 
		as response measurements.</p>
<p>A subject expert would need to decide on which 
		was most relevant to the aims of the experiment.</p>
	<p class=heading> Controlled variables</p>
	<p>Thought also needs to be given to which variables need to be controlled
		(the input variables) and what settings should be used for these variables
		in different experimental runs.</p>
