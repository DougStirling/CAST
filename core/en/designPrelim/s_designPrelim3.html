<p class="heading">Ethical issues arise</p>
	<p>There are a few practicalities that complicate experimentation with human subjects.
		For ethical reasons, experiments involving potential danger to the subjects are not
		possible. Even if there is no known danger, the subjects should be aware of what is
		involved in the experiment and must give informed consent. </p>
	<p class=heading> Controls</p>
	<p>Treatments that involve change  should usually be compared to a  'treatment' in which there is no change. Individuals for whom there has been no change are called <strong>controls</strong>.</p>
	<p class=heading> Placebos</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the act of administering a treatment to a human subject may itself
		affect the response, irrespective of the treatment effect. For example, if a drug
		is being assessed for its ability to reduce headaches, the knowledge that medication
		has been administered may make the subject feel better, even if the drug has no active
		ingredient. </p>
	<p>To avoid the psychological effect of the treatment on the subject being confounded 
		with the effect of the drug, an indistinguishable 'treatment' with no effect may 
		be given to the control group of subjects; this is called a <strong>placebo</strong>. </p>
	<p class=heading> Double-blind experiments</p>
	<p>A further complication may arise when the measured response from each subject
		may be affected by knowledge of the treatment applied. If the experimenter knows
		which treatment has been applied to each experimental unit, there may be a
		subconscious tendency to systematically over- or under-assess one treatment.</p>
	<p>In a <strong>double-blind</strong> experiment, neither the experimenter 
		not the subject knows which treatment has been applied. Again, the aim is to ensure that other factors 
		do not act as lurking variables to confound comparisons of the treatments.</p>
