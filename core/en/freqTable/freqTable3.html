<p class="heading">Necessary property of a frequency table</p>

<p>A frequency table distributes each of a collection of 'individuals' into 
	one of several categories. Each individual must therefore contribute <strong>1</strong> 
	to <strong>exactly one</strong> of the counts in the table.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Make sure that you can recognise whether a table 
			of counts or percentages is a frequency table.</p>
</div></div>

	<p class="heading">UN survey responses</p>

	<p>The United Nations conducted a survey about the extent to which countries 
		implemented a set of 'Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics' in 
		their National Statistics Offices. The table below was published in a UN 
		report and describes which countries were sent questionnaires (the recipients) 
		and which ones returned the questionnaires (respondents).</p>
	<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#999999">
		<tr> 
			<td><img src="images/unRespondentsBottomTable.gif" width="524" height="349"></td>
		</tr>
	</table></div>
	<p>It is particularly important to recognise frequency tables because the 
		graphical methods that will be described in the next section are inappropriate 
		for most other types of data.</p>
	<hr width="75%">
	<p>Finally, note that the values in the bottom right of the table below do 
		not form a frequency table either.</p>
	<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#999999">
		<tr> 
			<td><img src="images/unResponseRates.gif" width="524" height="349"></td>
		</tr>
	</table></div>
	
	<p>When there are only 2 categories, a single value (such as the response 
		rate of 81% here) adequately summarises the frequency table, so the column 
		of response rates in the published table is a concise summary.</p>
