<p class="heading">Modifying a frequency table</p>

  <p>A frequency table shows the numbers and proportions of 'individuals' in various 
		categories. There are a few ways in which such tables can be modified, either 
		to make the information clearer or to highlight particular aspects.</p>
		
	<dl>
		<dt>Reordering categories</dt>
		
    <dd>In some frequency tables, there is a natural ordering of the categories 
      (e.g. <em>strongly agree</em>, <em>agree, indifferent, disagree</em> and 
      <em>strongly disagree</em>). The categories should be arranged in this order 
      in the table. If there is no natural ordering, then it often helps to arrange 
      the categories by the frequencies, with the highest frequency first and 
      the lowest frequency last.</dd>
	</dl>
  <br>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Alphabetic ordering of the categories is rarely 
				best.</p>
</div></div>

  <br>
	<dl>
		<dt>Combining categories</dt>
		<dd>The information in the table may be clearer if the number of categories 
			is reduced by combining some together. For example, published tables often 
			categorise hospital operations into 50-100 different categories. A coarser 
			categorisation (e.g. orthopaedic, cancer, ...) gives a more easily understood 
			overview.</dd>
	</dl>
  <br>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The frequency for a combined category is the 
        sum of the frequencies for the categories that are being merged. The percentages 
        are also added.</p>
</div></div>

  <br>
	<dl>
		<dt>Looking at subsets of categories</dt>
		<dd> It may be useful to 'hide' some categories in the table, and look only 
			at the distribution of the remaining categories. This corresponds to looking 
			only at a sub-group of the individuals.</dd>
	</dl>
	<br>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The frequencies for the categories are unchanged, 
				but the percentages should divide them by the total for the <strong>displayed</strong> 
				categories, so they still add to 100%.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>These techniques will be clearer in an example.</p>

		<p class="heading">Road crashes by road feature</p>

    <p>The table below shows the number of road crashes causing injury or death 
			in New Zealand in 2005, categorised by the type of 'road feature' at the 
			crash site.</p>

<p>The 'road features' were grouped into <em>Intersections</em> and <em>Non-intersections</em> 
	in the report and are shown in different colours in the table. However the 
	ordering of categories within the groups in the report was not particularly 
	meaningful. Click the two checkboxes <strong>Sort by frequency</strong> 
	to reorder the features by their frequency of accidents within each group.</p>
<p>Click the checkboxes <strong>Combine categories</strong> to combine the 
	different types of intersections and non-intersections into a frequency 
	table with two rows. This table highlights the differences between intersections 
	and non-intersections.</p>
<p>Finally, expand the categories for <em>Intersections</em> and click <strong>Hide 
	categories</strong> for the <em>Non-intersections</em>. This shows the distribution 
	of road features for the accidents that occurred at intersections. Note that 
	hiding the non-intersection categories restricts attention to the accidents 
	that occurred at intersections. The total therefore changes to the number 
	of accidents at intersections and the percentages become percentages out 
	of this new total.</p>
