<p class="heading">Proportions</p>
	<p>The proportions of values in the categories (also called the <strong>relative 
		frequencies</strong> of the categories) are the frequencies divided by the 
		total number of values.</p>
	<p class="heading">Percentages</p>
	<p>The proportions are often expressed as percentages &mdash; simply the proportions 
	multiplied by 100. For example, a proportion of 0.034 is more concisely expressed as 3.4% but contains identical information. It is usually easier to quickly compare a column of percentages than the corresponding column of proportions.</p>
	<p>Percentages are usually easier to interpret than the raw frequencies, so 
		frequency tables are often augmented with an extra column of percentages.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Causes of death of kestrels">
<p class="heading">Kestrel causes of death</p>

<p>The frequency table below shows the causes of death of kestrels (a bird of 
prey) in Britain between 1963 and 1997. (Carcasses were sent to the researchers 
in response to advertisements in bird-watching magazines and journals and the 
cause of death was found from information sent by the finder and examination of 
the carcass.)</p>

<div class="centred">

<p>Choose the option <strong>Count &amp; proportion</strong> under the frequency 
table to see the proportion of kestrels dying from each cause. </p>

<p>Finally, choose the option <strong>Count &amp; percentage</strong> to express 
the proportions as percentages. Although the percentages are simply 100 times 
the corresponding proportions,  the information 
in the data stands out better when percentages are used.</p>
