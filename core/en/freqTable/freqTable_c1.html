<p class="heading">Numerical and categorical data</p>

<p>In a data set, a <strong>numerical</strong> variable contains a number
from each individual. A <strong>categorical</strong> variable classifies each
individual into one of several groups. For example,
an investigation of the religions with which a group of 100 individuals identify might
result in the 100 values,
</p>

  <p align=CENTER>catholic, anglican, atheist, anglican, muslim, ... </p>
  
  <p>In many data sets, the values are not ordered in any meaningful way. For 
    example, the 100 individuals above were not surveyed in any particular order. 
    (If the data were collected in order, time series methods should be used to 
    analyse them.) We only consider unordered categorical data in this chapter.</p>
<p class="heading">Frequency tables</p>
  
  <p>An unordered <strong>numerical</strong> data set holds much detailed information 
    about the distribution of values. (A dot plot shows full information about 
    the distribution, though we may choose to summarise with a histogram or summary 
    statistics.)</p>
  
  <p>In contrast, an unordered <strong>categorical</strong> data set contains 
    much less information. The frequencies for the distinct categories are the 
    number of times each category occurs in the data set.</p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The frequencies fully capture <strong>all</strong>  
            information about the distribution of values.</p>
	</div></div>
<p> These frequencies are usually presented as a <strong>frequency table</strong>.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Student degrees">
		<p class="heading">Student degrees</p>

		
    <p>As part of a survey of students graduating at a university, 36 students were randomly 
      selected from four degree programmes. For each graduating student, the class of degree  was recorded (1st, 2nd or 3rd class). The 36 resulting categorical values are shown on the left of the 
      diagram below.</p>

		<p>To calculate the frequencies for each of the three classes of degree by hand, 
			you would work through the table of values, drawing a line against the appropriate 
			category name for each student (a tally). These tallies would  finally be 
			counted to give the frequencies.</p>
		<p><strong>Click</strong> on each of the categorical values in turn to illustrate 
			how the tallies and frequencies are obtained.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">

	<p class="heading">Examining one variable from many</p>
	<p>In surveys like the student degree survey above, several measurements are often recorded 
		from each participant. Although in-depth analysis of the data would investigate 
		the relationships between the variables, it is often useful to examine the 
		distributions of the variables one-at-a-time.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Student degrees">
		<p class="heading">Student degrees</p>

		<p>In the student survey that was described above, five variables were measured 
			from each student.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The degree type (BBS, BSc, BA or BEd)</li>
			<li>The number of courses failed before graduating</li>
			<li>The class of degree (3rd, 2nd or 1st class)</li>
			<li>The student's age at graduation</li>
			<li>The amount of student loan that was accumulated ($thousand)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Frequency tables could be used to summarise the categorical variables whereas 
			dot plots could summarise the distributions of the three numerical variables. 
			The diagram below shows the data in tabular form and we will again build 
			up the frequency distribution of the classes of degree.</p>
