<p>Reports present information in three main ways &mdash; tables, graphs and text.</p>

<p class=heading>Textual descriptions</p>
<p>Paragraphs of text are rarely adequate descriptions of the information in data 
on their own. Graphical and tabular displays invariably convey information much 
more clearly and in a much more immediate and memorable way. However graphics 
and tables must be integrated into a report, and there is definitely a place for 
text to describe the source and background of the data and to summarise the notable 
features of the display.</p>
<p>Text should be used to summarise and interpret information in tables and graphs, 
but not to simply repeat in words information that has already been clearly presented 
in another form. Such repetition tends to obscure rather than inform.</p>
<p class=heading>Tables</p>
<p>Tabular displays are often effective summaries of very simple data sets. For 
example, the following table describes the New Zealand defence force personnel 
in 2005 as concisely as any graphical display.</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
<tr> 
<th align="left">&nbsp;</th>
<th>  Count  </th>
<th>Percentage</th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>Navy</td>
<td style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-left:1px solid #999999;" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">1,910</td>
<td style="border-top:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">22%</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>Army</td>
<td style="border-left:1px solid #999999;" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">4,438</td>
<td style="border-right:1px solid #999999;" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">52%</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>Air force</td>
<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999; border-left:1px solid #999999;" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">2,266</td>
<td style="border-bottom:1px solid #999999; border-right:1px solid #999999;" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">26%</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th align="left">Total</th>
<th>8,614</th>
<th>100%</th>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>For a very non-technical audience however, a pie chart may be preferred.</p>
<p>Larger tables can concisely present a lot of detailed information to the reader. 
However the danger is that the ‘broad picture’ is often obscured by 
the detail &mdash; it is hard to see the wood for the trees. There is often a way to 
display the data graphically that makes the 'signal' in the data more prominent.</p>
<p>Large tables should usually be summarised briefly in the body of a report with 
the full table relegated to an appendix or made available for download from a 
web site. In particular, the availability of large tables of raw data on a web 
site may make it easier for technically able readers to do further analysis of 
the data. </p>
<p class=heading>Graphical displays</p>
<p>Graphical displays such as bar charts, pie charts, histograms, maps and scatter 
plots are particularly effective ways to convey information since the human eye 
can readily detect, interpret and retain patterns. There are many further ways 
to graphically display information.</p>
<p>What is it that makes a statistical display of data excellent? There is no 
better discussion of this than in Tufte’s book, “The Visual Display 
of Quantitative Information”. You are encouraged to examine the many examples 
of the art which are shown in that text. To quote Tufte,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas 
communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Even simple ideas need to be presented with that same clarity, precision and 
efficiency. Any statistical graphic should show the data efficiently and truthfully, 
should not distort the information in the data and should be closely integrated 
with numerical and verbal descriptions of the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Annotation</p>

  
<p>A good graphical or tabular display can often ‘speak for itself’ 
&mdash; its message is immediately clear without further explanation. However it often 
helps to write comments on a diagram (a) to point out important features and (b) 
to add extra information such as labels that give extra insight. Two examples 
of annotated graphics are shown below.</p>
<div class="diagram">

		
<p class=heading>Atomic weight and volume</p>
<p>The following diagram was printed in Tufte's book. The added text and grey 
lines on the scatterplot help to highlight the periodicity of properties of chemical 
elements. A brief textual commentary in the main text would also help.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/atomicNumbers.gif" width="500" height="360"></p>
<p class=heading>Life expectancy and income</p>
<p>The scatterplot below shows the life expectancy and gross national income (GNI) 
per capita in all countries in 2004. The annotation highlights seven countries 
whose life expectancy is much less than would be expected from their GNI and gives 
an explanation. It also labels the country with the highest GNI per capita and 
the caption summarises the relationship in words.</p>
