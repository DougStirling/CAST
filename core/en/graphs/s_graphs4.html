<p class="heading notPrinted">Multiple simple graphs</p>
<p>It is easy to confuse the reader by incorporating too
much information in a graphic, but simple graphics can sometimes be combined
in rich ways that encourage the reader to investigate the relationships between
different measurements.</p>
<p>When planning any such diagram, critically consider whether it may be too
complex to be easily understood by the intended audience.</p>
<p class=heading>New Zealand wool exports in 1879</p>
<p>The following diagram presents information about wool production and
exports in New Zealand in 1879. It effectively shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The locations of all large sheep farms</li>
<li>The locations of all ports from which wool was exported and the quantity
of wool exported from each</li>
<li>Annual rainfall throughout New Zealand</li>
</ul>
<p>The eye is encouraged to investigate the relationship between the location
of sheep farms, the climate and ports.</p>
