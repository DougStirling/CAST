<p class=heading>Multiple simple graphs</p>

  
<p>Many publications only include simple graphical displays of data such as bar 
charts and time series. It is easy to confuse the reader by incorporating too 
much information in a graphic, but simple graphics can sometimes be combined in 
rich ways that encourage the reader to investigate the relationships between different 
measurements.</p>
<p>To be effective, the different elements of the display should usually be linked 
to either a <strong>time axis</strong> (e.g. a collection of related time series 
drawn against a common time axis) or a <strong>map</strong> (e.g. pie charts drawn 
next to each region).</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Consider whether different information can be linked in a single 
display.</p>
</div></div>

	
<p>When planning any such diagram, critically consider whether it may be too complex 
to be easily understood by the intended audience.</p>
<div class="diagram">

		
<p class=heading>New York weather in 1980</p>
<p>The following diagram was published in the New York Times to describe the weather 
in 1980.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/nyWeather.gif" width="681" height="310"></p>
<p>This diagram was commended by Edward Tufte as a graphic that is extremely rich 
in data but is still easily understandable. It shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum and maximum temperatures each day in the year (black zig-zag band)</li>
<li>The normal minimum and maximum temperatures throughout the year (curves on 
top of actual temperature band)</li>
<li>Actual and normal rainfall each month (bar charts in centre)</li>
<li>Relative humidity each day (bottom of diagram)</li>
<li>Annual summaries of temperature and rainfall compared to normal (two boxes)</li>
</ul>
<p>The format encourages the reader to look for relationships between temperature, 
rainfall and humidity. For example, the daily temperature range (maximum â€“ 
minimum) was typically lower in the winter than in the summer (shaded vertical 
distance between the minimum and maximum time series). Also, the period from late 
August to early September was much warmer than normal. (Both maximum and minimum 
daily temperatures tended to be higher than normal during this period.)</p>
<p>Also note the use of annotations to indicate the warmest and coldest days in 
the year.</p>
<p class=heading>New Zealand wool exports in 1879</p>
<p>The next example is a map that appeared in the Bateman New Zealand Historical 
Atlas to present information about wool production and exports in New Zealand 
in 1879. It effectively shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The locations of all large sheep farms</li>
<li>The locations of all ports from which wool was exported and the quantity of 
wool exported from each</li>
<li>Annual rainfall throughout New Zealand</li>
</ul>
<p>The eye is encouraged to investigate the relationship between the location 
of sheep farms, the climate and ports.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/nzWoolExports.gif" width="500" height="712"></p>
<p>(The use of 3-dimensional piles of wool bales to represent exports might be 
criticised but the scale &mdash; 500,000&nbsp;lb of wool per bale &mdash; means that it 
is unlikely to mislead here.)</p>
