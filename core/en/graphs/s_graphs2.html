<p class=heading>Selecting information to display</p>
<p>A large volume of data is often collected during any project, so any
report must be very selective about the information that is displayed.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The report should summarise the most important features of
the data.</p>
</div></div>

<p>This is similar to the distinction that engineers make between  the <strong>signal</strong> that is being communicated
between two locations and the <strong>noise</strong> that is added by the communications
channel. The noise degrades the signal and, in the worst cases, can make the
signal difficult to detect. </p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Signal &nbsp; = &nbsp; information you want<br>
Noise &nbsp; = &nbsp; 'random' modification to the signal</p>
</div></div>

<p>An important goal of data presentation is to extract the
'signal' from a data set and clearly display it without the 'noise' of the less
important detail in the data.</p>
<p class=heading>Prune out unnecessary detail</p>
<p>Many reports are filled with bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots
and a variety of other plots, just because the researcher produced them when
exploring the data!  Graphics, tables and text should only be included if they
add new and interesting information about the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Before producing a report or other publication, it is important
to first identify the most important information that you want to convey.</p>
</div></div>
