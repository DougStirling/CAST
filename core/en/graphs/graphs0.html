<p>Although a statistician always uses graphs and other diagrams to help extract 
information from data, this chapter has concentrated on the subsequent step of 
reporting the resulting information to others. This is really the final step in 
a process that involves <strong>data collection</strong>, <strong>data analysis</strong> 
and <strong>data presentation</strong>.</p>

<p>Paper-based publications were once standard but information is increasingly 
published electronically. Publication of reports and information on the internet 
as web pages or downloadable documents avoids printing costs, allows the use of 
colour, and documents are easily updated when more recent information is available; 
diagrams can also be dynamic. However computer screens have lower resolution than 
paper, limiting the detail that can be shown on a single diagram</p>
<p class="heading">Reports and other publications</p>
<p>Reports use tables, graphs and text to present information. Principles for 
effective presentation of data in tables and graphs were described in earlier 
sections. Textual annotation should be considered to point out important features. 
Text should interpret but not simply repeat information.</p>
<p>Clear presentation is an art as well as a science and must take into account 
the level of the intended audience. As stated by Edward Tufte,</p>

<p>Excellence in statistical graphics consists of 
complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency.</p>

<p class="heading"> Innovative graphics</p>
<p>Most reports contain only tables and graphs of the types described in earlier 
sections of this chapter. Technical publications may use more advanced graphics, 
but there is also scope to devise novel simple ways to effectively display specific 
types of data. These may link together several simple graphs in ways that encourage 
the eye to identify patterns and relationships, or they may be completely original.</p>
<div class="boxed" style="background-color:#99CCCC">
<p>Always spend time critically examining any reports that you write
for their clarity, precision and efficiency.</p>
