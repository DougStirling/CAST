<p class=heading>Other types of graphic</p>

  
<p>In this chapter, we have concentrated on a few commonly used types of graphical 
display of data. It is rare for a non-technical publication to go beyond these 
general-purpose graphs.</p>
<p>However an innovative graphic can sometime work well for a particular type 
of data. Two examples are given below.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>If your data are of a non-standard type, you may be able to 
devise a novel way to clearly display them.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="diagram">

		
<p class=heading>Napoleon's invasion of Russia</p>
<p>The diagram below was published by Charles Joseph Minard in 1861. Edward Tufte 
says that &quot;it may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.&quot; 
(The diagram has been redrawn slightly with some place names omitted for a computer 
screen.)</p>


<div class="boxed">
<p><img src="images/napoleon.gif" width="600" height="280"></p>
</div>


<p>The diagram portrays Napoleonâ€™s disastrous campaign of 1812-1813 when 
his army invaded Russia. After laying siege to Moscow, Napoleon was forced to 
retreat by the harshness of the Russian winter. The width of the band describes 
the number of surviving soldiers during the invasion and retreat. It effectively 
illustrates where the soldiers died during the campaign. The temperature graph 
at the bottom shows the temperatures during the retreat.</p>

<p class="heading">Maori migration in New Zealand</p>
<p>The indigenous population in New Zealand is Maori and many of them have migrated 
from rural areas to the cities (mainly Auckland) in the last half century. The 
diagram below is based on a distorted map of New Zealand in which the areas of 
the regions are proportional to their Maori populations.</p>
<p>The widths of the arrows represent the numbers migrating between regions, as 
determined in a survey that was conducted in the 1960s. It clearly shows movements 
of the Maori population. </p>
