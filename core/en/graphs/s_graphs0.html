<p class="heading notPrinted">Data presentation</p>
<p>Graphs, tables and diagrams are used by statisticians to help extract
information from data, but they are equally important as a way of
<strong>reporting</strong> the resulting information to others.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/sequence.gif" width="500" height="40"></p>
<p>Reports use tables, graphs and text to present information and several principles
for effective presentation of data were described in earlier
sections. Textual annotation should be considered to point out important features
but should interpret but not simply repeat information.</p>

<p>Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas communicated
with clarity, precision and efficiency.</p>

<p class="heading">Innovative graphics</p>
<p>Although basic graphical displays are often effective,  there is also scope
to devise novel simple ways to effectively display specific types of data. These
may link together several simple graphs in ways that encourage the eye to identify
patterns and relationships, or they may be completely original.</p>
<div class="boxed" style="background-color:#99CCCC">
<p>Always spend time critically examining any reports that you write for their
clarity, precision and efficiency.</p>
