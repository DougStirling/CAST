<p class=heading>Purpose</p>

  
<p>Information is published for several purposes.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Public reports</dt>
<dd>Most organisations publish reports about specific aspects of their work that 
are aimed at a wide audience. These are often regular publications such as annual 
summaries about aspects of the state if the organisation, but specialist reports 
and press releases may be written about specific projects or topics. Brevity is 
important, so the information in reports must be presented concisely and clearly.</dd>
<dt>Executive reports</dt>
<dd>These are usually internal reports about specific topics. It can often be 
assumed that the readership is more technically sophisticated, so more advanced 
analyses and presentation can be used.</dd>
<dt>Archival and regular publications</dt>
<dd>There is often a need to provide access to detailed data to allow further 
analysis. Large tomes of tabulated data were once published by government organisations, 
but such data are often provided electronically now. In spreadsheet format, users 
can easily input the data into other programs </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some organisations have a statutary obligation to provide certain information 
at regular intervals (often annually). This information is usually archival, but 
sometimes a 'Yearbook' is published for a wider audience and its format is therefore 
closer to a report.</dd>
</dl>
<br>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Care must be taken to present information clearly in all types 
of publication, but it is most important for publications aimed at the general 
public and least important for archival data.</p>
</div></div>

<p class=heading>Publication medium</p>
<p>A few decades ago, all information was published in black and white on paper. 
Colour is now used more often in paper publications, but an increasing proportion 
of publications are produced only electronically for display on a computer. Such 
computer publications are often provided over the internet.</p>
<p>The use of colour in both paper-based and electronic publications makes it 
much easier to present information clearly, especially in graphs.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Quality and resolution of medium</dt>
<dd>Colour print on glossy paper is best but expensive. Computer screens also 
show colour but their resolution is relatively low &mdash; typically a tenth of the 
number of 'dots' per unit area that would be used on paper. The poorer resolution 
of a computer limits the type size of text and the detailed information that can 
be presented, especially if the screen is small. Newsprint and many other low-quality 
colour printing processes have reasonable resolution but allow only limited if 
any use of colour.</dd>
<dt>Cost</dt>
<dd>It is much cheaper to make large quantities of information available on the 
internet than on paper. However the cost of producing publications on paper tends 
to ensure that they are designed better &mdash; there is a conscious effort to cut 
back the presentation to the essentials that convey the intended message. It is 
much harder to create a user interface that allows users to easily find information 
that is published on a web site. It is critically important that web sites are 
easy to navigate and the structure of the web site must be included in the cost 
of publishing the information.</dd>
<dt>Format</dt>
<dd>Many reports are published on the internet as 'pdf' files. These are the electronic 
equivalent of a series of printed pages and can be laid out with text and graphics 
in the same way as is done on paper. Although pdf files are still limited by the 
screen resolution of the computer, it is possible to zoom in and to print them 
at much higher resolution.
</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dd>An alternative is to publish information directly as web pages that can be 
viewed from a web browser. Although the ability to format such web pages was limited 
until recently, web pages can now be laid out almost as flexibly as on paper (using 
functionality called <em>cascading style sheets</em>). It is possible to make 
a web site interactive, both for navigation around the site and for interacting 
with individual pages. (CAST itself is an example of what is possible.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Archival data can be directly provided on the internet in spreadsheet format. 
Alternatively, large organisations often have a web-based interface that can extract 
information from a large behind-the-scenes database. For example, the United Nations 
provides a wealth of information that can be accessed at <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cdb">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cdb</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some types of publication must be printed on paper in order to reach a wide 
audience. In contrast, archival information is best provided on a web site because 
there are likely to be few users and they will find the information most useful 
electronically. However with computers and internet connections becoming more 
common, a well-designed web site is becoming a very powerful and flexible way 
to present information.</p>

<p>There is no perfect publication medium, but a well-designed 
web site should be considered.</p>
