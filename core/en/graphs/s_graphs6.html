<p>An innovative graphic can sometime work well for a particular type
of data. If your data are of a non-standard type, you may be able to
devise a novel way to clearly display them.</p>
<p class=heading>Napoleon's invasion of Russia</p>
<p>The diagram below was published by Charles Joseph Minard in 1861.</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><img src="images/napoleon.gif" width="600" height="280"></p>
</div></div>


<p>The diagram portrays Napoleonâ€™s disastrous campaign of 1812-1813 when his
army invaded Russia. After laying siege to Moscow, Napoleon was forced to retreat
by the harshness of the Russian winter. The width of the band describes the number
of surviving soldiers during the invasion and retreat. It effectively illustrates
where the soldiers died during the campaign. The temperature graph at the bottom
shows the temperatures during the retreat.</p>
