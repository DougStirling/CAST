<p class=heading>Selecting information to display</p>
<p>Most organisations have access to large amounts of information about any topic.</p>
<ul>
<li>An education department will collect information from students sitting national 
exams about their age, gender, region, school name and results.</li>
<li>Health boards collect a wide range of information about each patient including 
their current illness, previous illnesses, length of stay in the hospital and 
various other measurements such as age, weight and blood pressure.</li>
<li>Airports record a large amount of information about passengers and flights 
including nationality, origin and destination, airline and time of day and year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any report must be very selective about the information that is displayed. 
It should concisely summarise the <strong>important</strong> features of the data. 
The decision about what is the important information in data is subjective but 
is critically important.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">

the data.</p>

<p class=heading>Signal and noise</p>
<p>The distinction between the 'important' information in data and the rest is 
similar to the distinction between <em>signal</em> and <em>noise</em> in electronics 
and telecommunications. Engineers distinguish between the <strong>signal</strong> 
that is being communicated between two locations and the <strong>noise</strong> 
that is added by the communications channel. The noise degrades the signal and, 
in the worst cases, can make the signal difficult to detect.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Signal &nbsp; = &nbsp; information you want<br>
Noise &nbsp; = &nbsp; 'random' modification to the signal</p>
</div></div>

<p>As in electronics, an important goal of data presentation is to extract the
'signal' from a data set and clearly display it without the 'noise' of the less
important detail in the data.</p>

<p class=heading>Example of signal and noise</p>

<p>The word 'CAST' can be seen below. This is the signal in the picture.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="370" height="200">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>
<param name="appletName" value="structureProg.AddNoiseApplet">
<param name="customText" value="Signal=Signal#Noise=Noise">
</applet>
</div>

<p>Drag the slider to the right to add random noise to the picture. Even when 
the slider is in the middle, it is becoming hard to distinguish the signal 
in the picture.</p>

<p>Adding noise makes it harder to detect the signal 
in the picture.</p>

<p class=heading>Prune out unnecessary detail</p>
<p>Many reports are filled with bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots 
and a variety of other plots, just because the researcher produced them when exploring 
the data! It is sometimes useful to ask yourself <em>'What single display of the 
data conveys the information most relevant to the message I wish to convey?</em>' 
If there is more than one thing to convey, then more charts may be needed, but 
at least this priority approach prevents you from spending too much time on less 
important details, and at the same time encourages you to decide what really is 
important. Graphics, tables and text should only be included if they add new and 
interesting information about the data.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Before producing a report or other publication, it is important 
to first identify the most important information that you want to convey.</p>
