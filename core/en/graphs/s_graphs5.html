<p class="heading notPrinted">Other types of diagram</p>
<p>We have only described a few general-purpose graphical methods for describing
data. In general, publications that
are intended for a wide readership should avoid more complex graphics, but other
ways to present data graphically are useful for some data sets.</p>
<p>Always use the simplest graphical method that will convey the information
that you want.</p>
<p class=heading>Road accidents in Israel</p>
<p>The diagram below is called a <strong>spie chart</strong> and is based on
a circle that shows a standard pie chart of the age and sex distribution in Israel.</p>


<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p><img src="images/spieChart.gif" width="512" height="356"></p>
</div></div>


<p>The darker segments describe the ages of all road accident casualties in Israel
in 2002; they use the same slices as for the overall population distribution
with their radius adjusted to make the areas of the slices in proportion to the
number of casualties in that age group and gender.</p>
<p>The 'bulges' show age groups where there are a disproportionate number of
casualties.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Take care with interpretation of the graph. The bulge in male
casualties aged 15-54 could be caused by <strong>more reckless
drivers</strong> of this age, but they probably <strong>also spend
more time driving</strong>.</p>
