<p class="heading">Standard errors for estimates</p>  
<p>In the design of an experiment, the decision to vary a factor at block level instead of at the level of the experimental units should not be taken lightly.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>If a factor is varied at block level in an experiment, its effect will be estimated less accurately than if it had been varied within blocks.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Researchers should therefore vary factors at the finest level that is practical in an experiment.</p>
<div class="diagram">
<p class="heading">Illustrative example</p>
<p>The diagram below shows 54 experimental units blocked into groups of 6. The sliders above the scatterplot adjust the amount of variability between the blocks and within the blocks and the scatterplot shows the response values that might have been obtained <strong>if no factors were varied</strong> in the experiment.</p>

<p>We  now consider a split-plot experiment using the same experimental units in which factor A (with 3 levels) is varied at block level and factor B (also with 3 levels) is varied at unit level.</p>
<p>The two standard errors under the table describe the accuracy of estimates of the differences between the mean response at levels 1 and 2 of each factor.</p>
<p>Adjust the sliders and observe that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The standard error for  factor A is always higher than that for  factor B.</li>
	<li>Reducing the variation within blocks improves the accuracy of both estimates but there is a limit to the accuracy that can be obtained for  factor A (unless all blocks are also identical).</li>
</ul>
