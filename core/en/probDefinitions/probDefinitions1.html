<p class="heading">Uncertainty</p>

<p>There are many situations in which we do not know precisely what will happen.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Examples</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Will it be raining at 12 noon tomorrow?</li>
		<li>If I pick a card from a shuffled deck, will it be a spade?</li>
		<li>How long will it take me to drive to work?</li>
		<li>Who will win the men's and women's tennis finals at Wimbledon next year?</li>
		<li>Will I get a serious disease in the next ten years?</li>
		<li>Will my baggage go missing on my next flight?	</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>In each situation, it could be argued that the outcome is largely deterministic â€” for example, if we knew exactly the temperatures and air pressures around the globe at present, understood the mechanics of changing weather and had enough computing power, we should be able to get an extremely accurate forecast of the midday weather tomorrow. However <strong>with current knowledge</strong>, there is no choice but to treat the outcome as being random, with various possible outcomes.</p>
<p class="heading">Probability</p>
<p>Uncertainty is described by the <strong>probabilities</strong> of the different possible events that might occur. We will  properly describe how probability might be defined later in this section, but the <strong>concept</strong> is that its value describes chance on a scale of zero to one, as shown below.</p>
