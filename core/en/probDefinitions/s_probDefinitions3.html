<p class="heading">Equally likely outcomes</p>

<p>There are some kinds of experiment where we believe that all possible outcomes have the same chance of arising. This is usually justified by symmetry in the physical mechanism underlying the experiment. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tossing a coin — a head and a tail are equally likely.</li>
	<li>Picking a card from a shuffled deck — all 52 cards are equally likely.</li>
	<li>Drawing the winning ticket in a lottery — all tickets have the same chance of being picked.</li>
</ul>

<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>If an experiment has \(N\) equally likely outcomes and an event, \(E\), consists of \(x\) of them, then  its probability  is defined to be</p>
\[P(E) = \frac x N\]
</div>

<p>In other words,</p>
\[P(event) = \frac {\text{Number of outcomes in } event} {\text{Number of outcomes in  sample space}}\]

<p>This is called the <strong>classical</strong> definition of probability and is the easiest to understand.</p>
<p class="heading">Sampling a value from a finite population</p>
<p>Many applications with equally likely outcomes involve games of chance such as cards, dice and roulette wheels.</p>
<p>However equally likely outcomes  also arise when sampling a value from a finite population. If  all population members have the same chance of selection, then this definition of probability can again be used.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Household size in Mauritius</p>
	<p>The following bar chart describes the size of all households in Mauritius in its 2011 census.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_mauritiusHouseholds.png" width="483" height="321" alt=""/></p>
	<p>The probability that a randomly chosen household is of any size is the proportion of such households in the census.</p>
