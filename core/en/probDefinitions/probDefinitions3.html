<p class="heading">Experiments where all outcomes are equally likely</p>

<p>There are some kinds of experiment where we believe that all possible outcomes have the same chance of arising. This is usually justified symmetry in the physical mechanism underlying the experiment. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tossing a coin — a head and a tail are equally likely.</li>
	<li>Picking a card from a shuffled deck — all 52 cards are equally likely.</li>
	<li>Drawing the winning ticket in a lottery — all tickets have the same chance of being picked.</li>
</ul>

<div class="definition">
	<p class='definitionTitle'>Definition</p>
<p>If an experiment has <em>N</em> equally likely outcomes and an event, <em>E</em>, consists of <em>x</em> of them, then  its probability  is defined to be</p>
\[P(E) = \frac x N\]
</div>

<p>In other words,</p>
\[P(event) = \frac {\text{Number of outcomes in } event} {\text{Number of outcomes in  sample space}}\]

<p>This is called the <strong>classical</strong> definition of probability and is the easiest to understand.</p>
<div class="example">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Rolling a 6-sided die</p>
	<p>When rolling a standard 6-sided die, each of the six faces is equally likely. The probability of getting an even number greater than three is therefore</p>

\[ \begin{aligned}
P(\text{even value greater than 3}) &amp; = P(\{\text{4, 6}\}) \\
&amp; =\frac {\text{number of outcomes in {4, 6}}} {\text{number of outcomes in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}}} \\
&amp; =\frac 2 6 = \frac 1 3
\end{aligned} \]

<p class="heading">Sampling a value from a finite population</p>
<p>Many applications with equally likely outcomes involve games of chance such as cards, dice and roulette wheels. However equally likely outcomes  also arise when sampling a value from a finite population. If the value is randomly selected using some mechanism that gives all population members the same chance of selection, then probabilities can be determined in the same way.</p>


<div class="example" title="Example of sampling from a finite population">
	<p class="exampleHeading">Categorical example</p>
	<p>In the population of 44 categorical values below, there are 27 
		'success' and 17 'failure' values. The probability that a single value sampled 
	from this population is a success is therefore <sup>27</sup>/<sub>44</sub>.</p>
