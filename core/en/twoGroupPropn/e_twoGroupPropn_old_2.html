<p>This page provides some exercises that give practice with evaluating and interpreting 
p-values. As in the previous exercises about evaluating confidence intervals, 
we strongly recommend using statistical software to perform hypothesis tests in 
practice. However there are important general principles that are reinforced by 
performing a few exercises by hand.</p>

  <div class="diagram"> 
	<p class="heading">Exercises</p>
	<p>In the exercises below, you will perform a mixture of one-tailed and two-tailed 
	  hypothesis tests. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Use the green templates on the right to separately estimate the standard deviations
		of the proportions of 'successes' in both groups.</li>
	<li>Combine these standard deviations to estimate the standard deviation of
		their difference.</li>
	<li>Standardise the difference between the sample proportions to find the z-value
		for the test.</li>
	<li>Drag over the standard normal curve to read off the lower tail area corresponding to z.</li>
	<li>Use the tail area to evaluate the appropriate p-value, then select your conclusion.</li>
	<li>Click the button <strong>Check</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeat with different questions until you feel confident with the method.
