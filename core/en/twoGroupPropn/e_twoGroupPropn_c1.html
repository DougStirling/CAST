<p class="heading">Why do exercises by hand?</p>

<p>This page provides some exercises that give practice with the steps used to 
evaluate a 95% confidence for the difference between two proportions. Although 
you are encouraged to use computer software to evaluate confidence intervals in 
practical situations, there are important general principles in all of the steps, 
so it is worthwhile to try a few exercises to ensure that you understand these 
general principles.</p>

<ul>
	
<li>Use the green templates on the right to separately estimate the standard deviations 
of the proportions of 'successes' in the two groups.</li>
	<li>Combine these standard deviations to get an estimate of the standard deviation of
		their difference.</li>
	<li>Use this standard deviation to complete the 95% confidence interval under the question.</li>
	<li>Click the button <strong>Check</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeat with different questions until you feel confident with the method.
