<p class="heading notPrinted">Difference between two proportions</p>
<p>Within each group, the sample proportion of successes,<em> p</em>, has
a distribution that is approximately normal in large samples and has mean and
standard deviation</p>

<p>Applying the  general results about the difference between two independent
random quantities:</p>

<p>Since the individual proportions are approximately normal (in large samples),
their difference is also approximately normal:</p>
