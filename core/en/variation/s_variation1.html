<p class="heading notPrinted">Signal and noise</p>
	<p>Electronics and telecommunications engineers distinguish between the <strong>signal</strong> that is being communicated between two locations and the random <strong>noise</strong> that is added by the communications channel. The noise degrades the signal 
		and, in the worst cases, can make the signal difficult to detect.</p>
	<p>The word &quot;CAST&quot; is hard to read in the following noisy image.</p>
	<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_noisyText.gif" width="337" height="137"></p>
	<p>Audio equipment often quotes its <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong> as 
		a measure of quality. Noise again deteriorates the signal &mdash; the 'perfect' 
		music that you want to hear. </p>

<p>Signal &nbsp; = &nbsp; information you want<br>
					Noise &nbsp; = &nbsp; 'random' modification to the signal</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The concepts of signal and noise also apply to data 
	sets.</p>
