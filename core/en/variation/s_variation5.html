<p class="heading notPrinted">Types of variation</p>
<p>The ideas of signal and noise 
		correspond to <strong>explained</strong> and <strong>unexplained variation</strong> in a variable, <em>X</em>.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Explained variation </dt>
		<dd>This is the amount that other variables in the data set explain differences
between the values of <em>X</em> &mdash; the signal.</dd>
	<dt>Unexplained variation</dt>
		<dd>Some differences between the values of <em>X</em> cannot be explained in
terms of the changing values of other variables in the data set. The unexplained
variation is noise.</dd>
</dl>
	<p>In some data sets, <strong>none</strong> of the variation in  <em>X</em> can be explained in terms of other variables that have been recorded. In other data sets, some of the variation in <em>X</em> can 
		be explained in terms of other variables whose values are available, but part 
		of its variation remains unexplained.</p>
	<p>A statistical analysis often separates and describes these two components 
		of the variation. Both provide useful information.</p>
