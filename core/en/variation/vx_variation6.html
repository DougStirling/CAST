<p>Unexplained variation in 
data is not always 'noise'. It can be interesting in its own right, 
especially when we are interested in predicting the future. If we can assume
that there will be no systematic change to the process that generated the observed
values in our data,</p>

<p>... the proportion of times that an event happened in the past indicates the
chance that it will happen in the future.</p>

		<p>For countries that are susceptible to drought, the variability in past 
			weather records might give information about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The chance of rain at different times in the year.</li>
			<li>The chance that annual rainfall will be less than 200 mm.</li>
			<li>The chance of rain being so late that crops will fail.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This information can potentially help farmers decide which crops to plant 
			and when to plant them.</p>
