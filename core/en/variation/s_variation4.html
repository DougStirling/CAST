<p class=heading>Surveys</p>
	<p>Some types of data are obtained from experiments. In experiments, we actively change some characteristics of each individual &mdash; choosing an experimental treatment.</p>
	<p>Other types of data are obtained by selecting a sample of individuals in
some way and simply recording information about them &mdash; a <strong>survey</strong>.</p>
<p class=heading>Summarising data</p>
	<p>Survey data sets are often large and are  summarised by numerical
values called <strong>summary
statistics</strong>.<br>
	</p>
<p>Natural variability between individuals means that summary statistics 
		 must  be considered as random quantities 
	&mdash; similarly collected data would result in different values.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A important role of statistics is to understand and describe the randomness
of such summary statistics.</p>
