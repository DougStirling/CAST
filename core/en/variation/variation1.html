<p class=heading>Signal and noise</p>

<p>Electronics and telecommunications engineers distinguish between the <strong>signal</strong> 
	that is being communicated between two locations and the random <strong>noise</strong> 
	that is added by the communications channel. The noise degrades the signal 
	and, in the worst cases, can make the signal difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Audio equipment often quotes its <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong> as 
	a measure of quality. Noise again deteriorates the signal &mdash; the 'perfect' 
	music that you want to hear. </p>

<p>Signal &nbsp; = &nbsp; information you want<br>

	<p>The word 'CAST' can be seen below. This is the signal in the picture.</p>

<p>Drag the slider to the right to add random noise to the picture. Even when 
the slider is in the middle, it is becoming hard to distinguish the signal 
in the picture.</p>

<p>Adding noise makes it harder to detect the signal
