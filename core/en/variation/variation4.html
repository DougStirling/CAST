<p class=heading>Surveys</p>

  <p>Some types of data are obtained from experiments such as the tomato-growing experiment on the previous page. In experiments, we actively change some characteristics of each individual &mdash; for example adding fertiliser to half of the tomato plants in the previous page.</p>
  <p>Other types of data are obtained by selecting a sample of individuals in some way and simply recording information about them. This type of data collection is called a <strong>survey</strong> and survey data sets are often so large that it is difficult to get any useful information 
	from the raw data in the data matrix.</p>
  <p class=heading>Summarising data</p>
  <p>To understand survey data, it is common to calculate numerical 
	values that summarise aspects of the data. Such summary values are called 
	<strong>statistics</strong>. </p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>We will describe several useful summary statistics 
					in <strong>later</strong> chapters of CAST.</p>
</div></div>

	<br>
	<p>An important consequence of the natural variability in data is that summary statistics 
		that are calculated from the data must also be considered as random quantities 
		&mdash; similarly collected data would result in different values for the statistics.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A major role of statistics is to understand 
					and describe the randomness of such summary statistics.</p>
</div></div>

  
	<p>The example below illustrates this variability with a very small survey.</p>
	
	<div class="diagram" title="Demonstration: Consumer preferences">

		<p class=heading>Preferences</p>

		
    <p>Food manufacturers often collect 'preference data' to discover which of 
      several recipes for a type of product is preferred by consumers. In the 
      example below, 30 consumers were each  given samples of strawberry yoghurt 
      with three different types of strawberry flavouring, <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> 
      and <em>C</em>. Each consumer reported the flavouring that was preferred.</p>

		<p>The raw data matrix consists of 30 rows (corresponding to the individuals 
			sampled) and one column (a categorical variable with values <em>A</em>, 
			<em>B</em> or <em>C</em> corresponding to the preference for each individual). 
			This can be summarised by the percentage preferring each of the three brands.</p>
		
    <p>Click <strong>Another 30 people</strong> a few times to repeat the data 
      collection with different groups of 30 people. The natural variability of 
      the people implies that the proportion preferring each flavouring varies. 
      A full analysis of the data should take account of the variability in the 
      proportion preferring flavouring A.</p>
