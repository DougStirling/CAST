<p class="heading">Tests based only on intra-block information</p>  
<p>Using the inter-block estimates to improve the accuracy of the intra-block estimates is relatively easy (at least for balanced designs) but it is harder to use the inter-block information to test whether the treatments have <strong>any </strong> effect on the response. Since most information about the treatments comes from the intra-block estimates,</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Researchers usually use the analysis of variance test described in Section 6.6 to test whether the treatments effect the response, ignoring the inter-block information.
	</div></div>
<p class="heading">Inter-block information about treatment differences</p>
<p>If there are more blocks than treatments, the block sum of squares in an analysis of variance can be partitioned into two components, a component explained by the different treatment combinations in the blocks and a second component that is a 'residual' sum of squares at block level.</p>
<p>There are therefore <strong>two</strong> different sums of squares relating to differences between treatments &mdash; one at block level and another at unit level. The usual intra-block analysis compares the unit-level treatment sum of squares to the unit-level residual sum of squares. It is however also valid to compare the block-level treatment sum of squares to the block-level residual sum of squares as a <strong>second</strong> independent test for differences between the treatments.</p>
<p>We will not further investigate use of inter-block information to test for a treatment effect or the combination of the inter-block and intra-block test results. However we note that the split of the  block-level sums of squares and associated test is closely linked to the test used in nested experiments.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<ul>
		<li>If the treatments are orthogonal to blocks, only the unit-level test can be used.</li>
		<li>If the treatments are varied at block level, only the block-level test can be used.</li>
		<li>In other experimental designs, both tests are valid but the unit-level (intra-block) test is usually more powerful.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Click <strong>Split units</strong> to split the unit-level sum of squares into a sum of squares explained by the feeding treatments and the residual sum of squares. The F-test comparing these has a p-value of 0.0084 so we conclude from the intra-block analysis that there is very strong evidence that the treatments do affect the weight gain of the pigs. (This is the test that was used in Section 6.6.)</p>
<p>Now click <strong>Split block</strong> to split the between-blocks sum of squares into a component that can be explained by the different mixtures of treatments in the blocks and a 'residual' sum of squares at block level. Comparing these sums of squares in an F-test gives a p-value of 0.0400, so the block-level test only gives moderately strong evidence of a difference between the feeding treatments.</p>
<p>As noted in the previous page, there is much more information about the treatment differences at unit level than at block level (the intra-block parameter estimates have lower standard errors than the inter-block estimates) so we would pay more attention to the intra-block test in our conclusions.</p>
