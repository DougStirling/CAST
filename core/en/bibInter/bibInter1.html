<p class="heading">Information about treatment effects</p>
<p>In a randomised block experiment, there are <strong>two</strong> potential sources of information about differences between the treatments.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Differences within blocks</dt>
	<dd>If two units within the same block have different treatments, the difference between their response measurements is an estimate of the difference between their treatment effects.</dd>
	<dt>Differences between block means</dt>
	<dd>The response averages in the different blocks may also provide information about the differences between the treatments.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These two sources of information are <strong>independent</strong>. The relative amounts of information of the two types depend on the design of the experiment.</p>
<p class="heading">Orthogonal randomised blocks</p>  
<p>In Chapter 4, we described randomised block designs in which the treatments were used in the same proportions within each block. In these designs, the treatments were orthogonal to the blocks.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Differences within blocks</dt>
	<dd>The standard estimate of the difference between any two treatment means can be written as an average of the within-block differences between the treatments.</dd>
	<dt>Differences between block means</dt>
	<dd>Since all blocks contain the same mix of treatments, the block means  contain <strong>no information</strong> about differences between the treatments.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">Nested experiments</p>
<p>The first section of this chapter described experiments in which the treatments  are varied at block level. In such experiment,</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Differences within blocks</dt>
	<dd>Since all units within a block get the same treatment, differences between units contain <strong>no information</strong> about treatment differences.</dd>
	<dt>Differences between block means</dt>
	<dd>The standard estimate of the difference between any two treatment means depends on the block means of the blocks getting these treatments.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">Other designs</p>
<p>In many experiments, the treatments are neither orthogonal to the blocks nor varied at block level. This may occur by design (e.g. lattice designs) or accident (e.g. missing values).</p>
<p>In these designs, some information about the treatments is available <strong>both</strong> from differences within blocks <strong>and</strong> from the block means.</p>
<div class="diagram">
	<p class="heading">A continuum of designs</p>
<p>The diagram below shows possible allocation of 5 treatments (A, B, C, D and E) to 50 experimental units in 10 blocks.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="420" height="300">

<p>The diagram initially shows treatments allocated in a randomised block experiment with all treatments used once per block. The average responses in the 10 blocks are all averaged over all 5 treatments, so the block averages can hold no information about treatment differences.</p>
<p>Drag the slider to the right to change the design to a nested design in which the treatments are allocated at block level. Since all units in a block get the same treatment, differences between units in a block hold no information about treatment differences.</p>
<p>At intermediate slider positions,</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<ul>
		<li>the design is not orthogonal but there is still <strong>some</strong> information about treatment differences from differences between units within blocks.</li>
		<li>some blocks get more of some treatments than other blocks, so the block means hold <strong>some</strong> information about treatment differences.</li>
	</ul>
