<p class="heading">Relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable</p>  
	<p>The previous page showed that the marginal relationship between two numerical 
		variables, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, can be very different from their conditional 
		relationship for specific values of <em>Z</em>. The same can happen when <em>X</em> 
		is a categorical variable. </p>
	<p class="heading">Marginal and conditional relationships</p>
	<p>When <em>X</em> is categorical (splitting the data into groups), there are 
		again two different types relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>, 
		depending on whether or not we make use of a third variable, <em>Z</em>.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Marginal relationship</dt>
		<dd>This is the observed relationship, ignoring any additional information 
			that is available. The relationship can be summarised by the means of <em>Y</em> 
			for the different groups (values of <em>X</em>).</dd>
		<dt>Conditional relationships, given <em>Z</em></dt>
		<dd>These conditional relationships are described in the same way as the marginal 
			relationship above, but are based on a subset of individuals with a particular 
			value of <em>Z</em>.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The marginal relationship can again be very different from the conditional 
		relationships, even changing 'direction'. This will be clearer in an example.</p>

		<p>In 2012, a marine reserve was created. The diagram below shows the weights 
			(kg) of seals that were observed along a coastline bordering the reserve 
			in March 2013 and March 2014. In the notation above, the <em>seal weight</em> 
			is <em>Y</em> and the <em>year</em> is a categorical variable, <em>X</em>.</p>

		<p>Since the mean <em>weight</em> is lower in 2014, it is tempting to conclude 
			that seals are smaller in 2014 than in 2013. (This is the marginal relationship 
			between seal weight and year.)</p>
		<p>Click the checkbox <strong>Slice</strong>. The seals were observed in four 
			different colonies and <em>colony</em> is a categorical lurking variable. 
			The diagram now shows seal <em>weights</em> from one colony, a conditional 
			distribution. Drag the slider and observe that the mean <em>weight</em> 
			of seals actually increased within each colony.</p>

<dl>
			<dt>Marginal relationship between <em>weight</em> and <em>time</em></dt>
			<dd>In 2014, the ecologists had decided to collect more information about 
				colonies containing immature seals. Since more seals were sampled from 
				the colonies containing smaller seals, the overall mean was lower in 2004.</dd>
			<dt>Conditional relationship for each <em>colony</em></dt>
<dd>The increase in mean size in individual colonies is a better indication that 
the seal sizes have increased &mdash; in each colony, the seals appear to be bigger.</dd>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Although seal weights increased in all colonies in 
						2014, more seals were sampled from colonies containing smaller seals, 
						so the overall (marginal) average seal weight decreased.</p>
