<p class="heading">Relationship between two numerical variables</p>
	<p>In an earlier chapter, we described various methods to describe the relationship 
		between two numerical variables, <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A scatterplot displays the raw data</li>
		<li>Their correlation coefficient describes the strength of the relationship</li>
		<li>A least squares line can be used to predict <em>Y</em> from <em>X</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Although these methods honestly describe the data, they can sometimes give 
		a misleading impression of how the two variables are related.</p>
	<p class="heading">Marginal and conditional relationships</p>
	<p>The problem arises when other variables are also associated with both <em>Y</em> 
		and <em>X</em>. This can arise when the extra variables are either numerical 
		or categorical, but is easiest to explain with an extra categorical explanatory 
		variable, <em>Z</em>.</p>
	<p>The <strong>marginal relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em></strong> 
		is the relationship that is evident in a scatterplot of the two variables 
		without taking into account any other variables. In contrast, the <strong>conditional 
		relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> given <em>Z</em></strong> is 
		the relationship that is evident within subsets of the data corresponding 
		to different values of <em>Z</em>.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The strength and direction of the marginal relationship 
					between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> may be different from those of the 
					conditional relationships given <em>Z</em>.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>It is possible for the marginal relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> 
		to show positive correlation, when the conditional distributions all have 
		zero or even negative correlation.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>When the marginal and conditional relationships differ, 
					the conditional relationships are usually more meaningful.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>(However we give an example at the end of this section where the marginal 
		relationship is more easily interpreted.)</p>
	<p class="heading">Lurking (or hidden) variables</p>
	<p>It is possible to examine the marginal <strong>and</strong> conditional distributions 
		of <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> if the third variable, <em>Z</em>, has been recorded. 
		However <em>Z</em> might not be one of the variables in our data set.</p>
	<p>If the marginal relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> is different 
		from their conditional relationship given <em>Z</em>, but <em>Z</em> has either 
		not been recorded or is ignored when analysing the data, then <em>Z</em> is 
		called a <strong>lurking </strong>variable (or a <strong>hidden</strong> variable).</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Always think about whether there might be a lurking 
					variable, <em>Z</em>, that is distorting the relationship that is observed 
					between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>The following example illustrates the difference between the marginal and 
		conditional relationships between two numerical variables, <em>X</em> and 
		<em>Y</em>, and shows how the marginal relationship can be misleading.</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Example: Eagle flight distances"> 
<p class="heading">Eagle flight</p>
<p>The distances that eagles fly vary greatly and a biologist investigates whether 
flight distances depend on the weights of the birds. In a study that extended 
over twelve months, 120 different eagles were each tagged with a radio transmitter 
for a period of two weeks. The average flight length (km per day) and weight (kg) 
of each eagle were recorded. A scatterplot of these measurements is shown below.

		<p>The marginal relationship between <em>flight length</em> and <em>weight</em> 
			shows a positive correlation, so it might be taken to imply that heavy eagles 
			tend to fly further than light eagles, and a naive biologist might try to 
			explain this in terms of their body mass providing the energy necessary 
			to extend their range.</p>
		<p>However this conclusion is flawed. The data were collected at different 
			times during the year, and <em>season</em> is a third variable that affects 
			both the weights of the birds and the distances that they fly.</p>

		<p>Click the checkbox <strong>Slice</strong>, then use the slider to display 
			the relationship separately for the birds that were observed in each month. 
			We now see that there is no clear relationship between <em>weight</em> and 
			<em>flight length</em> in the conditional relationship <strong>within each 
			month</strong>. </p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The observed relationship between <em>flight length</em> and

<p class="heading">Nutrition and exam performance</p>
		<p>A different investigator is studying child nutrition in developing countries. 
			The number of calories eaten daily by each child taking a particular school 
			examination and the exam mark are recorded. There is a positive relationship 
			between <em>food intake</em> and <em>exam results</em>. The investigator 
			claims that this shows that some children are performing poorly because 
			they are not eating enough and these findings are published widely. </p>

    
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Can you see the flaw in this conclusion?</p>
</div></div>

    <p>The nutritionalist should have considered what lurking variables might 
			affect both <em>exam results</em> and <em>food intake</em>. Families whose 
			parents are well educated are likely to have children who are better nourished, 
			and they are also likely to have children who perform well at school (either 
			for genetic reasons or because greater encouragement and help is given). 
		</p>

		<p><em>Family background</em> is therefore a lurking variable that could underlie 
			the observed relationship between <em>food intake</em> and <em>exam results</em>, 
			even if increasing food intake does not directly <strong>cause</strong> 
			improved exam results. </p>
