<p class="heading">Analysis using 'lurking' variables</p>
<p>Variables are only called 'lurking' variables if they are either <strong>unrecorded 
	</strong>or are<strong> unused</strong> when analysing the data. In order 
	to explain the resulting problems, we have used examples in which the values 
	of the lurking variables were available. To show the potential for reaching 
	the wrong conclusions, we presented two analyses of most data sets:</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>A simple naive analysis ignoring the lurking variable, and</li>
	<li>A more complete analysis using this variable (which should therefore no 
		longer be called 'lurking')</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the simple analysis can result in wrong conclusions, a full analysis 
	using the 'lurking' variable is always more complex.</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Do not ignore lurking variables to simplify the analysis &mdash; 
			you could reach the wrong conclusions from the data.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We now present a few more examples where lurking variables can lead to
the wrong conclusion from data.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
	<p class="heading">Ice cream and murders</p>
	<p>Weekly ice cream consumption and murder rates are highly correlated. Does 
		ice cream incite murder or does murder increase the demand for ice cream? 
		Neither &mdash; the relationship that is observed is the result of a lurking 
		variable, the weather. Both ice cream consumption and murder rates increase 
		in the summer.</p>
	<p>If average temperature was recorded each week, it would be possible to 
		examine how the murder rate is modelled by <strong>both</strong> temperature 
		and demand for ice cream. (This would probably show that only temperature 
		is an effective predictor of the murder rate!) However this analysis is 
		rather more complex than a simple scatterplot of murder rate against ice 
		cream demand.</p>
	<p class="heading">Damage from house fires</p>
	<p>In an analysis of damage caused by house fires, it was found that the more 
		firefighters that are sent to a fire, the greater the damage. Are the firefighters 
		<strong>causing</strong> extra damage? The lurking variable here is the 
		size of the fire &mdash; large fires both cause more damage and get attended 
		by more firefighters.</p>
	<p>Again, a full analysis taking account of fire size is more complex but 
		is essential to avoid reaching the wrong conclusion.</p>
