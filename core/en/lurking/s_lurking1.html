<p class="heading">Relationship between two numerical variables</p>
	<p>Scatterplots, correlation coefficients and least squares lines honestly summarise the relationship between two numerical variables, <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>
	<p>However they can sometimes give 
		a misleading impression about the relationship. The problem arises when other variables are also associated with both <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Marginal relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em></dt>
		<dd>The relationship that is evident in a scatterplot of the two variables 
		without taking into account any other variables.</dd>
		<dt>Conditional relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>, given <em>Z</em></dt>
		<dd>The relationship between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> that is evident within subsets of the data corresponding 
		to different values of <em>Z</em>.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The marginal and conditional relationships between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em> are often different and may even be in a different direction.</p>

	<p class="heading">Lurking (or hidden) variables</p>
	<p>If the marginal relationship between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> is different 
		from their conditional relationship given <em>Z</em>, but <em>Z</em> has either 
		not been recorded or is ignored when analysing the data, then <em>Z</em> is 
		called a <strong>lurking </strong>variable (or a <strong>hidden</strong> variable).</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Always think about whether there might be a lurking 
					variable, <em>Z</em>, that is distorting the relationship that is observed 
					between <em>Y</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>
