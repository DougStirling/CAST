  <p>A naive examination suggests that smokers are <strong>less</strong> likely 
to die &mdash; the proportion  dying between the two surveys was higher for non-smokers than for smokers.</p>
<p>However click <strong>Slice</strong> and drag the slider. Within any age group the proportion of smokers dying is higher than that of non-smokers.</p>

  <p>The direction of the marginal relationship was caused by a <strong>lurking variable</strong>, <em>Age</em>.</p>

<p>Older women were much more likely to die in the 20 years than young women. They were also much less likely to be smokers.</p>

  <p>The smokers were less likely to die <strong>because they were younger</strong>.</p>

<p>In 1972-74, a one-in-six health survey was conducted in Whickham in the North 
of England. Twenty years later, a follow-up study was conducted. Data were collected about whether each of  the 1,314 women was a current smoker in the earlier survey and whether she survived until the second survey.</p>
<p>Other variables such as the ages of the women were also recorded.</p>
