<p class="heading">Unavoidable variation in experimental units</p>
	<p>Identical experimental units result in the most accurate estimates of the effect of a factor. In practice however, we usually have little choice and the available experimental units  are often very variable.</p>
	<p>If we have no  prior knowledge of the experimental units, a completely randomised experiment is the best possible design.</p>
	<p class="heading">Matched pairs</p>
	<p>Knowing something about the characteristics of the experimental units allows us to do better.</p>
	<p>A simple example arises when there are two treatments. A <strong>matched pairs</strong> design groups the experimental units into pairs that are similar (using either numerical measurements about the units or a subjective judgement). The two treatments are randomly allocated within each pair.</p>
