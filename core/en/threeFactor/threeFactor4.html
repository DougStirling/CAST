<p class="heading">Residual and explained sums of squares</p>  
  <p>Each additional main effect or interaction term that is added to the model 
		gives extra flexibility, allowing the residual sum of squares to be reduced. 
		These reductions are the sums of squares that are <strong>explained</strong> 
		by the terms and they are presented in a sum of squares table with their degrees 
		of freedom.</p>
	<p>In a factorial experiment with equal replicates for all factor combinations, 
		the factors and their interactions are orthogonal (uncorrelated) so the order 
		of adding terms in the sum of squares table does not affect their sums of 
		squares.</p>
	<p class="heading">Analysis of variance (anova) table</p>
	<p>A column of mean sums of squares (sums of squares divided by their degrees 
		of freedom) is added to the sum of squares table. The mean explained sums 
		of squares are compared to the mean residual sum of squares with F ratios.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Large explained sums of squares correspond to significant 
					terms.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>A p-value for each term shows whether its F ratio is larger than could be 
		expected by chance.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The p-values are used to decide which terms are unimportant 
					and can be dropped from the full model.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>Note however that we should only consider hierarchical models, so terms must 
		not be dropped if higher-order interactions involving them are still in the 
		model.</p>

    <p>The diagram below initially shows the best-fitting model with all interactions 
			for the soft drink bottling data.</p>

		<p>The 3-factor interaction term has a high p-value and is not significant

		<p class="heading">Wear of coated fabrics</p>
    <p>An experiment was conducted to assess the durability of coated fabric subjected 
			to standard abrasive tests. A factorial experiment was conducted with two 
			different fillers (F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>) in three different proportions 
			(25%, 50% and 75%), either with or without surface treatment of the fabric. 
			Two replicate fabric specimens were tested for each of the 12 treatment 
			combinations in a completely randomised design. The response is the weight 
			loss (mg) of the fabric specimens in the abrasion test.</p>

		<p>For this data set, neither the 3-factor interaction nor the 2-factor interaction 
			between <em>Surface treatment</em> and <em>Percentage filler</em> are significant. 
			Use the checkboxes to delete these two terms from the model.</p>
		<p>This model has two 2-factor interaction terms so it is a little harder
