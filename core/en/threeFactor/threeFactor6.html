<p class="heading">Estimating the error variance (variance of the experimental 
		error)</p>  
  <p>In any experiment, it is important to obtain an estimate of the error variance, 
		σ<sup>2</sup>, 
		&mdash; the response variability that would occur in repeated runs with the same 
		factor levels. The mean residual sum of squares provides the best estimate 
		of σ<sup>2</sup>,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>The mean residual sum of squares is used by all tests 
					in the analysis of variance table.</p>
</div></div>

	<p>If a factorial experiment involves factors with several levels, even a single 
		replicate with all combinations of factor levels can involve many runs of 
		the experiment. For example, if three factors each have 3 levels, there are 
		27 treatment combinations. It is often too expensive to conduct two replicates 
		of the experiment.</p>
	<p>If there is only one replicate, the full model with all interaction terms 
		will fit the data perfectly with zero residuals and zero residual degrees 
		of freedom. The error variance cannot be estimated for this model so it is 
		not possible to test the significance of any terms.</p>
	<p class="heading">Assumption of zero high-order interactions</p>
	<p>The only way to test the significance of model terms is to <strong>assume</strong> 
		that some high-order interactions are negligible. In an experiment with three 
		factors it could be assumed that the 3-factor interaction is unimportant, 
		making its sum of squares a measure of experimental variability. In other 
		words, we would only consider models with 2-factor interactions so the 3-factor 
		interaction sum of squares would be part of the residual sum of squares.</p>
	<p>The assumption of no 3-factor interaction allows us to test all 2-factor 
		interactions and main effects.</p>

    <p>An experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of three different 
			types of heat treatment on the decarburisation of steel. Two furnaces were

		<p>The full 3-factor model with all interactions fits the data exactly, so 
			there are zero degrees of freedom for the residuals and we cannot test the 
			significance of any terms in the model.</p>
		<p>Click the checkbox for the 3-factor interaction to remove it from the model. 
			This effectively changes the sum of squares and its degrees of freedom for 
			this interaction into a residual sum of squares with 6 degrees of freedom.</p>
		<p>With no 3-factor interaction, tests can be performed on all 2-factor interactions 
			and the main effects.</p>
