<p class="heading">Properties of a sample proportion</p>

<p>Sample proportions vary from sample to sample. Our model (of sampling from an underlying
population) therefore means that they have probability distributions.
</p>

<p>The sample proportion in a particular category from a random sample
of size <i>n</i> has a distribution that ...
</p>

<ul>
  <li>is centred on the underlying population probability,
	π, and</li>
  <li>has a spread that decreases as the sample size <i>n</i> increases.</li>
</ul>


  <p class="heading">Count and proportion of successes</p>
  <p>Although the sample proportion in a category, <span class="em black">p</span> , 
		is a good summary statistic, the raw count of sample values in the category, 
		<span class="em black">x</span> <span class="black">&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>np</em></span>, 
		contains equivalent information and is often easier to use. </p>
	<p>Both <span class="em black">p</span>  
		and <span class="em black">x</span> <span class="black">&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>np</em></span>		have distributions with same shape (other than the scaling constant <i><span class="black">n</span></i>).</p>


<div class="diagram" title="Illustration: Brand loyalty"> 
<p class="heading">Brand loyalty</p>
<p>Brand awareness and brand loyalty are extremely important marketing tools, 
and many advertising campaigns focus on the brand name rather than on specific 
products. The power of a recognised brand name is shown by the following experiment.</p>
<p>Two ninth grade students at Burnaby South Secondary School in Vancouver conducted 
the following science project. Sixteen test subjects were blindfolded, given a 
slice of pizza that they were told was ordered from Pizza Hut and another slice 
that they were told was ordered from a local pizza delivery shop, and were asked 
to pick which slice tasted better. Unknown to the subjects, all slices were purchased 
from the same source, but all 16 test subjects picked the Pizza Hut slice as 'best'.</p>
<p>We will investigate this type of experiment with a simulation. If the brand 
name had <strong>not</strong> influenced decisions on which slice was best, the 
probability that any subject picked the 'Pizza Hut' slice as best would be 0.5 
and, providing the subjects did not talk to each other about their choices, the 
choices would be independent.</p>
<p>The diagram below performs this simulation &mdash; values are sampled from an infinite 
categorical population of a half 'Pizza Hut' and a half 'Other' values. </p>

		<p>Click the checkbox <strong>Accumulate</strong> then take a few samples 
			to build up the distribution of the proportion picking Pizza Hut as best 
			in samples of size <i>n</i> = 16. The distribution is discrete since only 
			a few distinct values are possible. The distribution of the sample proportion 
			should be centred on π&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5. 
		</p>

		<p>Use the pop-up menu to change the sample size and repeat sampling to verify 
			that the sample proportion has lower spread when the sample size is higher.</p>
		<p>Finally, use the pop-up menu to change the scale on the sampling distribution 
			of the proportions to show the the distribution of the sample <strong>number</strong> 
			of times that Pizza Hut is chosen as best. Observe that the shape of the distribution is unchanged.</p>
