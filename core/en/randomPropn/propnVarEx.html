<h1>Does Australia Post deliver on time?</h1>

<p>Having some knowledge about the behaviour of the sampling distribution enables 
	us to make decisions concerning the population proportion Ï€ 
	based on sample data.</p>
<p>Consider the following example. The Herald-Sun newspaper published the following 
	article on November 25 1992, which reported on doubts raised by the results 
	of a study carried out by a journalist concerning the proportion of letters 
	delivered on time.</p>
	

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>
			<p><strong>Doubt has been cast over Australia Post&#146;s claim of delivering 
				96 per cent of standard letters on time.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>A survey conducted by the Herald-Sun in Melbourne revealed that 
				less than 90 per cent of letters were delivered according to the schedule.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Herald-Sun staff posted 59 letters before the advertised&#133;</strong></p></p>

<p align="right"><em>Campbell Fuller, Herald-Sun, 25 November 1992.</em></p>
<p>Is the author justified in disputing Australia Post&#146;s claim that 96% of 
	letters are delivered on time?</p>
<h3>A simulation</h3>
<p>If Australia Post's claim is correct, and every letter posted independently 
	has probability 0.96 of being delivered on time, we know that the number delivered 
	on time out of 59 letters will be a random quantity. From the information in 
	the article, we can deduce that 52 out of the Herald-Sun's 59 letters arrived 
	on time (a proportion 52/59&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.881).</p>
<p><strong>How unlikely is it to get only 52 out of 59 letters arriving on time 
	if Australia Post's claim that the probability of letters arriving on time is 
	0.96 is correct?</strong></p>
<p>We will use a simulation to help answer this question.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="inferenceProg.SuccessDistnApplet.class" width="600" height="450">
<param name="catVarName" value="Delivery of letters">
<param name="catLabels" value="#On time# Late">
<param name="probLabel" value="Prob of being on time">
<param name="nLabel" value="Number of letters =">
<param name="probLimits" value="0.960">
<param name="nSampleSize" value="1">
<param name="sampleInfo0" value="*59/50 60 50 1/52/50.0 59.0 180 53.0/0.50 8.00 150 3.0">
<param name="decimals" value="4">
</applet>
</div>

<p>Click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to observe the sample-to-sample 
	variability of the number of letters arriving on time.</p>
<p>Now click <strong>Accumulate</strong> and take between 100 and 200 samples. 
	Observe the distribution of the number of letters arriving on time. The proportion 
	of runs of the simulation that gave 52 or fewer letters arriving on time is 
	shown under the dot plot. Observe that this rarely happens.</p>
<p>We therefore conclude that the article is justified &mdash; only 52 letters being 
	delivered on time is most unlikely if all letters independently have probability 
	0.96 of being delivered on time.</p>
<h3>Fitting a normal distribution to the results</h3>
<p>Display the simulation results as a histogram (choose <strong>Histrogram</strong> 
	from the pop-up menu on the bottom left of the diagram).</p>
<p>We will now fit a normal curve to this distribution. Select <strong>Simulation 
	and Normal</strong> from the pop-up menu on the right of the diagram. Use the 
	two sliders to adjust the normal parameters to match the normal distribution 
	to the histogram.</p>
<p>The button <strong>Best (Simulation)</strong> sets the normal parameters to 
	the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of simulated counts.</p>
<p>We can do better with a little probability theory! The button <strong>Best 
	(Model)</strong> sets the normal mean and standard deviation to values that 
	can be determined theoretically from the probability 0.96 of letters being delivered 
	on time.</p>
<p>(The probability of getting 52 or fewer letters delivered on time can also 
	be determined from this normal distribution &mdash; it is given below the sliders 
	for the parameters. However since the distribution is actually binomial and 
	the normal distribution is only an approximation, the probability is not particularly 
	accurate in the tails of the distribution.)</p>
<h1>Extending the simulation</h1>
<p>The diagram below gives a little more flexibility to the simulation.</p>

<div class="centred">
<applet codebase="../../java" code="inferenceProg.SuccessDistnApplet.class" width="600" height="450">
<param name="catVarName" value="Delivery of letters">
<param name="catLabels" value="#On time# Late">
<param name="probLabel" value="Prob of being on time">
<param name="nLabel" value="Number of letters =">
<param name="probLimits" value="0.850 0.980 0.960">
<param name="nSampleSize" value="2">
<param name="sampleInfo0" value="*59/35 60 35 5/52/40.0 59.0 380 50.0/0.50 15.00 290 5.0">
<param name="sampleInfo1" value="200/140 200 140 10/188/150.0 200.0 500 180.0/2.0 42.0 400 8.0">

<p>Use the slider at the top left to reduce the probability of each letter arriving 
	on time to 0.92, then repeat the simulation. Is the paper's findings (52 out 
	of 59 arriving on time) consistent with this probability?</p>
<p>We will now change to a different hypothetical scenario &mdash; 188 out of 200 letters 
	being found to arrive on time in a different city. Is this consistent with a 
	probability 0.96 of letters arriving on time?</p>
<p>Use the pop-up menu to change the number of letters to 200 and reset the probability 
	to 0.96. Now repeat the simulation. Are these results consistent with a probability 
	0.96 of letters arriving on time?</p>
