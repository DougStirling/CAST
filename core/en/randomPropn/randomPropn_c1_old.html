<p class="heading">A sample proportion has a distribution</p>

<p>If a categorical data set is modelled as a random sample from a categorical 
population, the sample proportions in the various categories must be treated as 
random quantities &mdash; they vary from sample to sample.</p>
<p>The population proportion in any category of a categorical population is called 
the category's <strong>probability</strong>, and the Greek letter π 
is often used to denote the probability of a particular category of interest. 
The corresponding sample proportion is usually denoted by <em>p</em>.

<p>It is important that you understand the distinction between a sample proportion 
and the underlying population probability.</p>

<p class="heading">Visitors to Hawaii</p>
<p>In January 2003, 517,141 tourists arrived in Hawaii by air. Of these, 177,759 
(34.4%) were recorded as visiting the island of Maui. We can model the decision 
a tourist makes in early February to visit Maui as a categorical value (visited 
or not) from a hypothetical infinite population of 34.4% who visit Maui and 65.6% 
who do not.</p>
<p>Consider ten tourists arriving on 1st February. They would be modelled as a 
random sample of <i>n</i> = 10 values from this population. </p>

visit Maui varies from sample to sample. </p>

<p class="heading">Unknown probabilities</p>
<p>In some applications, we know the population probabilities for the categories 
of interest, but usually these values are unknown. (In practice, population parameters 
are usually unknown constants.) The corresponding sample proportions are approximations 
to these probabilities, but it is important to recognise that the underlying probabilities 
are unknown.</p>

<p class="heading">Use of the internet by doctors</p>
<p>The internet has had a major impact on how many types of business operate. 
In a nationwide survey of 400 practicing physicians in the USA, it was found that 
356 were using the Internet. The symbol π 
denotes the probability of a physician in the USA using the Internet. The diagram 
below shows the results graphically. </p>

<p>The unknown parameter π 
is of greatest interest, but we only know the sample proportion using the Internet, 
p = 0.89, which throws some light on the likely value of π. 
</p>
</div>

<p>Understanding the sample-to-sample variability of a proportion allow us to 
assess the proportion that is observed in a single observed data set. </p>
