<p class="heading">General notation</p>
	<p>In a categorical population, we choose one category of interest and call it <em><strong>success</strong></em>; all other categories are collectively called <em><strong>failures</strong></em>. The population proportion of successes is denoted by <span class="black">π</span>.</p>
	<p>When a random sample of <i><span class="black">n</span></i> values is selected, 
		we denote the number of successes by <span class="em black">x</span>  and the proportion of successes by <span class="em black">p</span> <span class="black">&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em><span style="vertical-align:20%">x</span></em>/<em><span style="vertical-align:-20%">n</span></em></span>. </p>
	<p class="heading">Distribution of a sample proportion</p>
	<p>The number of successes, <span class="em black">x</span> , 
		has a 'standard' discrete distribution called a <strong>binomial distribution</strong> which has two parameters, <span class="em black">n</span>  and <span class="black">π</span>.</p>
	<p>In practical applications, <span class="em black">n</span>  is a known constant, but <span class="black">π</span> may be unknown. The sample proportion, <span class="em black">p</span> , 
		has a distribution with the same shape, but is scaled by <span class="em black">n</span> .</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The distribution of <em>p</em> is centred on π.</li>
		<li>The spread of the distribution of <em>p</em> decreases as <em>n</em> increases.</li>
		<li>The distribution is symmetric when π 
			= 0.5, but becomes more skew as π 
			approaches 0 or 1.</li>
	</ul>
