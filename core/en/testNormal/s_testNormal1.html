<p>We now concentrate on a random sample from a \(\NormalDistn(\mu, \sigma^2)\) distribution and develop hypothesis tests about the  distribution's two parameters. Initially we assume that  \(\sigma^2\) is a known value and consider how perform tests about \(\mu\). The test may be one-tailed, such as</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\mu = \mu_0 \)</li>
	<li><strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>: \(\mu \gt \mu_0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>or two-tailed,</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: \(\mu = \mu_0 \)</li>
	<li><strong>H<sub>A</sub></strong>: \(\mu \ne \mu_0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>where \(\mu_0\) is a known constant.</p>
<p class="heading">Test statistic</p>
<p>The sample mean, \(\overline{X}\), could be used as a test statistic but, in practice, it is easier to use its standardised version as the test statistic,</p>
\[
Z \;\;=\;\; \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{\diagfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
\]
<p>This has a standard normal distribution, \(Z \sim \NormalDistn(0,1)\) if <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong> is true.</p>
<p class="heading">P-value and interpretation</p>
<p>The p-value for the test is found by comparing the value of the test statistic (evaluated from the data set) to the standard normal distribution. For a one-tailed test, this is one tail area of the distribution, but for a two-tailed test, it is <strong>double the smaller</strong> tail area since values of \(\overline{X}\) below \(\mu_0\) give the same evidence against <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong> as values above it.</p>
<p>The p-value is interpreted in the same way as for all other hypothesis tests. A small value means that a value of \(\overline{X}\) as far as was observed from \(\mu_0\) would be unlikely if the null hypothesis was true, and this provides evidence suggesting that the alternative hypothesis is true. The diagram below illustrates for a 2-tailed test.</p>
