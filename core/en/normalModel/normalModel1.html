<p class="heading">Analysing experimental data</p>  
<p>After the experiment has been conducted, the resulting data must be analysed 
  to estimate and test the effects of the controlled variables.</p>
<p>These estimates and tests are based on a statistical <strong>model</strong> 
  for the response that explains how its value varies between the experimental 
  units.</p>
<p class="heading">Reasons for variability in the response</p>
<p>In experimental data, there are three potential reasons for variability in 
  the response.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Different values of the controlled variables</dt>
  <dd>Changing the value of a factor can result in changes to 
    the response. The purpose of the experiment is to assess the magnitude of 
    these changes. This is called <strong>explained</strong> variation since 
    it can be explained in terms of the explanatory factors.</dd>
  <dt>Understood differences between the experimental units</dt>
  <dd>The design of many experiments makes use of known differences between the experimental units. For example, they may be grouped into  blocks of similar units; some of the variation in the response may be associated with such blocks. The variation in the response associated with this known structure of the experimental units is also <strong>explained</strong> variation.</dd>
  <dt>Other differences between the experimental units</dt>
  <dd>There is usually natural variability between the experimental units and 
    in the measurement process. Two response measurements with the same values 
    for the explanatory variables will usually differ. This natural variability 
    cannot be explained in terms of the controlled variables and is called <strong>unexplained</strong> 
    variation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The difference between the first two components of variation is important but:</p>
