<p class="heading">Experiments with many factors</p>  
  <p>In many research contexts, there is a large number of factors that could 
		potentially affect the response. The first step in the investigation is therefore 
		a <strong>screening experiment</strong> that is designed to identify the most 
		important factors &mdash; those that have the greatest effect on the response.</p>
  <div class="diagram"> 
    <p class="heading">Hardness of car paint</p>
    <p>The aim of this experiment is to evaluate which of 15 compounds (A - O), 
			added to a car paint will increase its hardness when sprayed onto a car 
			panel.</p>
    <p>Each of the 15 additives can be either absent or present at a fixed concentration 
			in any sample of paint, with mixes possible, so there are 15 controlled 
			factors for the experiment. The hardness of the paint (as measured by a 
			scratch test) has to be as high as possible.</p>
    <p>A screening experiment should identify a smaller number of additives whose 
			affect on hardness would be studied in greater depth in a later experiment.</p>
    </div>

  <p class="heading">Ranking of factors</p>
  <p>In most screening experiments, only two levels are used for each factor. 
    The estimated effect for any factor is the difference between the mean response 
    at these two levels,</p>
  <p class="eqn"><img src="images/effectDefn.gif" width="218" height="19"></p>
  <p>The most important factors are these whose factor effects are furthest from 
    zero. </p>
  <p class="heading">Choice of factor levels</p>  
  <p>For each numerical factor, a decision is needed on the values that correspond 
		to the 'high' and 'low' levels for the the factor. Preliminary trials may 
		help in this choice of factor levels.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The closer the factor levels, the smaller the estimated effect is likely 
			to be.</li>
		<li>The closer the factor levels, the harder it becomes for a hypothesis test 
			to detect any factor effect that exists.</li>
		<li>The further apart the factor levels, the greater the chance of the levels 
			spanning a region where the effect of the factor is nonlinear.</li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>The first point is particularly important if the estimated factor effects 
		are used to decide on 'important' factors. The decision about which factors 
		should be included in further studies must therefore take into account how 
		the 'low' and 'high' factor values were defined.</p>
