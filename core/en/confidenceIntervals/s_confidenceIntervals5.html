<p>A confidence interval does not always &quot;work&quot; — it may not actually include the unknown parameter value. A 95% confidence interval might be</p>
\[
0.7773 \;\;\lt\;\; \theta \;\;\lt\;\; 0.9483
\]
<p>but the value of \(\theta\) is unknown and may not actually lie within this interval. The best we can say is that we are <strong>95% confident</strong> that \(\theta\) will be between these two values.</p>

<div class="boxed">
<p>If confidence intervals were found from other similar random samples,  95% of them would include \(\theta\).</p>
</div>

<p>The notion of a confidence level therefore more a characteristic of the <strong>method of finding</strong> the confidence interval,  than a characteristic of the specific confidence interval from a single data set.</p>
<p class="heading notPrinted">Simulation</p>
<p>The  simulation below took 100 random samples of size <em>n</em> = 200 from a population with π = 0.6. Most of the confidence intervals included π = 0.6, but some did not. If the simulation was repeated many more times, the proportion including 0.6 would be close to 0.95.</p>

<p>In practice, you only have a single sample and a single confidence interval, but we have &quot;95% confidence&quot; that it will include the true (and usually unknown) value of π.</p>
