<p class="heading">One- and two-tailed tests</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to test whether two group means are the same or different â€” a two-tailed test. In other situations, the alternative hypothesis is that one specific group mean is larger than the other; this is a one-tailed test.</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'twoGroupInf', 'oneTailedHypoth', '572', '460');</script>

<p class="heading">Test statistic and p-value</p>
<p>The p-value for a one-tailed test about two means is found in a similar way to that for a two-tailed test. It is based on the same test statistic with the same t-distribution when the null hypothesis holds. The only difference is that the p-value is the tail area on only <strong>one</strong> side of the distribution.</p>

<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Examples</p>
<p>We now show a few examples of hypothesis tests and the conclusions that can be drawn from them.</p>

<p class="heading">Properties of p-values</p>

<p>We again stress that a statistical hypothesis test cannot provide a definitive 
answer. The randomness of sample data means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>p-values are also random quantities, and</li>
<li>there is some chance of us being misled by an 'unlucky' sample. </li>
</ul>

<div class="diagram">
	<p>A simulation  demonstrates that when the underlying population means are the same in two groups, a one-tailed test results in p-values that are equally likely to be anywhere between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>There is a (small) probability of getting random 
data that misleadingly suggest that the second group mean is higher.</p>
