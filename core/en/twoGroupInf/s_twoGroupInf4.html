<p class="heading">Testing for a difference between  two  means</p>
<p>The difference between two groups that is of most practical
importance is a difference between their <strong>means</strong>. </p>
<p class=eqn><span class="blue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub> &minus; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0</strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub> &minus; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;&ne;&nbsp; 0</strong></span></p>
<p>The summary statistic that throws most light on these hypotheses is the difference
between the sample means, <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>.
Testing therefore involves assessment of whether this difference is unusually
far from zero. </p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/pValue.gif" width="454" height="266"> </p>
<p>As with all other hypothesis tests, a p-value near zero gives evidence that
the null hypothesis does not hold &mdash; evidence of a difference between the group
means. </p>

<p class="heading">General properties of p-values</p>
<p>A statistical hypothesis test cannot provide
a definitive answer about whether two groups have different means. The randomness
of sample data means that p-values are also random quantities.</p>
<p>It is possible to get a small p-value (supporting H<sub>A</sub>) when H<sub>0</sub> is
true, and it is possible to get a large p-value (consistent with H<sub>0</sub>)
when H<sub>A</sub> is true.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed"><p>There is some chance of being misled by an 'unlucky sample.</p></div></div>
<dl>
<dt>If H<sub>0</sub> is true</dt>
<dd>All p-values between 0 and 1 are equally likely. For example, there is a
5% probability of getting a p-value less than 0.05.</dd>
<dt>If H<sub>A</sub> is true</dt>
<dd>The p-value is more likely to be near zero, though there is still some chance
of a larger p-value.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="heading">Effect of increasing the sample size</p>
<dl>
<dt>If H<sub>0</sub> is true</dt>
<dd>The p-values remain equally likely between 0 and 1.</dd>
<dt>If H<sub>A</sub> is true</dt>
<dd>The distribution of p-values becomes more concentrated near zero, so you
are more likely to conclude that the population means are really different.</dd>
