<p class="heading">Two-tailed tests for differences</p>

<p>The hypothesis tests on the previous page were appropriate for situations
with some kind of symmetry between our attitudes towards the two groups &mdash; the
alternative hypothesis did not specify any sign for the difference between the population
means. This type of test is a <strong>two-tailed</strong> test since test statistics
in <strong>both</strong> tails of the t distribution suggest that the alternative hypothesis
holds.</p>


<p class="heading">Examples</p>
<div class="centred"><table width="500" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" class="centred">
<tr><th width="400">Question</th>
	<th width="200">Alternative hypothesis</th>
</tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border:1px solid #999999;">A biologist hand-rears chicks of an endangered bird species using two
different diets. Does either diet make the chicks grow faster?</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border:1px solid #999999; border-left:0px">Mean chick weights after 4 weeks are different for chicks reared by the two diets.</td>

<tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border:1px solid #999999; border-top:0px;">Oestrogen levels were measured from 20 male patients who had just had heart attacks,
and for a control group of 20 normal males with the same mean age. Is oestrogen level
associated with heart attacks?</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-right:1px solid #999999; border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">Mean oestrogen level is different for the heart attack and control groups.</td>

<tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border:1px solid #999999; border-top:0px;">Two different types of nitrogen-based fertiliser are being compared, based
on wheat yields from 20 plots using each fertiliser. Does either fertiliser result
in higher yields?</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border-right:1px solid #999999; border-bottom:1px solid #999999;">Mean yield is different for the two fertilisers.</td>

</table></div>

<p class="heading">One-tailed tests for differences</p>

<p>In other situations, we want to test whether one specific group has a <strong>higher</strong>
mean than the other group. Alternatively, we may want to test whether one specific group
has a <strong>lower</strong> mean than the other group. These are called
<strong>one-tailed</strong> tests.

whether low concentrations of a naturally occurring compound act as a pesticide.
Twenty roses bushes are sprayed with the compound and another twenty act as controls.

<p class="heading">Test statistic and p-value</p>

<p>The test statistic for a 1-tailed test is identical to that for a 2-tailed 
test, but the p-value is obtained from only one tail of the t distribution. We 
illustrate below for testing the hypotheses,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="blue"><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;=&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub></strong><br><strong><font size="+1">H</font><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&mu;<strong><sub>1</sub> &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; </strong>&mu;<strong><sub>2</sub></strong></span> </p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is only supported by very small values of <span style="position:relative; top:5px"><img src="../../images/symbol.xBarDiff.png" width="36" height="15" align="baseline"></span>. 
This also corresponds to small values of the test statistic <span class="em black">t</span> , 
so the p-value is the lower tail probability of the t distribution. </p>

<p class="heading">Properties of p-values</p>

<p>We again stress that a statistical hypothesis test cannot provide a definitive 
answer. The randomness of sample data means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>p-values are also random quantities, and</li>
<li>there is some chance of us being misled by an 'unlucky' sample. </li>
</ul>

<p class="heading">Simulation when the underlying means are the same (H<sub>0</sub> is true)</p>
<p>The following simulation is like one on the previous page, but a 1-tailed test 
is used to compare the population means. Samples of size 20 are again selected 
from two populations, both of which are normal with mean 75 and standard deviation 
8.</p>

<p>Take several samples and observe the variation in the resulting p-value. Again 
observe that the p-values are <strong>usually</strong> greater than 0.1, so we 
would <strong>usually</strong> conclude that there is no evidence that &micro;<sub>1</sub> is higher than &micro;<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>However about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of the p-values are less than 0.1, 
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> are less than 0.05 and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> 
are less than 0.01.</p>
