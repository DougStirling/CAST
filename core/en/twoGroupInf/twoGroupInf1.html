<p class="heading">Distribution of difference between sample means</p>

<p>In the previous section, we saw that the difference between two independent 
quantities <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> 
and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> has a distribution with mean and standard deviation</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/meanSDDiff2.gif" width="113" height="51"> </p>
<p>We can apply this to obtain the distribution of the difference between the 
means of two random samples.</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/diffMeanSD.gif" width="340" height="163"> </p>
<p class="heading">Shape of the distribution</p>

<dl>
<dt>If the distributions are normal in each group,&nbsp;...</dt>
<dd>... the two sample means have normal distributions, and their difference is 
also normally distributed.</dd>
<dt>If the distributions are not normal in the two groups,&nbsp;...</dt>
<dd>... the <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('meanVar4')">Central 
Limit Theorem</a> states that the distributions of the two sample means approach 
a normal shape when the sample size increases, so their difference also approaches 
a normal shape.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In general therefore,</p>

groups, <br>

<p>The diagram below models an experiment in which volunteers who had developed a cold within the previous 24 hours are randomly given either zinc acetate lozenges or placebo 
lozenges (identical but with no active ingredient). The duration of the cold was recorded from each volunteer.</p>
<p>(The means and standard deviations are those obtained from an actual experiment that was <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('twoGroupModel5')">described earlier</a>.)</p>

<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then take several samples. Observe that the 
empirical distribution of the difference between the means matches the theoretical 
pink normal distribution.</p>
