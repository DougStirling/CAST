<p class="heading notPrinted">Categorical variables and groups</p>
	<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the individuals in a data set 
	into <strong>groups</strong>. We might treat  individuals with values &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;,
etc. as belonging to different groups.</p>
	<p>Conversely, if data were separately collected from different groups of individuals, 
		the resulting data sets could be combined with a categorical variable distinguishing 
		between the groups. Its values might be defined as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, etc. to identify the group membership of any individual.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A categorical variable and groups are often two ways of representing
the same data.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Data presented in a separate list for each group are  called <strong>unstacked</strong>
whereas if the data are presented
as a single list alongside a categorical variable, they are called <strong>stacked</strong>.</p>
