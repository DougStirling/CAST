<p class=heading>Clusters of 'individuals'</p>
	<p>In some data sets, the basic 'individuals' are arranged in fairly small groups
 or clusters. For example, surveys are often conducted by sampling households, then
recording information from every member of each household (a 'household survey').</p>
	<p>A categorical variable could distinguish between 
		the groups, but  its
	values (e.g. the houshold names) would be of little direct interest.</p>
	<p class=heading>Data at different levels</p>
	<p>Some measurements are usually recorded at group level rather 
		than individual level. These values could be stored in a separate group-level
data matrix.</p>
	<p class=eqn> <img class="gif" src="images/multilevelMatrices.gif" width="481" height="287"></p>
<p>Information can be exchanged between the two data matrices in order to analyse 
	both sets of data together.</p>

		<dd>The values of group-level variables could be copied into new variables in the individual-level data matrix.
</dd>
		<dt>Individual level &mdash;&gt; group level</dt>
		<dd>Summaries from each group of individuals, such as <em>household size</em> or <em>maximum age</em> could be added to the group-level data matrix.

	<p>Information can be obtained from multi-level data by examining both the group-level and individual-level data matrices.</p>

	<p>Properly analysing multi-level data and interpreting the results of the analysis
require a lot of careful thought!</p>
