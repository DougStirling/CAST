data sets to help extract useful information from their variables.</p>

<p class=heading>Data collection</p>

<p>Statisticians should be involved <strong>before</strong> any data are collected. 
	Statistical principles can be applied to the data collection process that 
	ensure that the resulting data can be meaningfully analysed. Chapters 7 and 
	8 explore the idea of random sampling and describe some principles that should be followed in data collection.</p>

<p class=heading>Inference</p>

<p>Data are often  considered to be representative of some underlying process
or population. The data are treated as a random sample and would be different
if the data were collected again. Methods to get information about the population
from a single sample are collectively called <strong>inference</strong>.</p>
