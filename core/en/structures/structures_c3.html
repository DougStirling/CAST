<p class=heading>Categorical variables and groups</p>
	<p>A categorical variable can be used to split the individuals in a data set 
		into <strong>groups</strong>. For example, a ski shop might record the value 
		of any 'extras' that are sold at the same time as new skis &mdash; a numerical 
		variable containing the value of the extras for each sale. If the salesperson 
		is also noted in a categorical variable, this variable could be used to split 
		the sales data into groups &mdash; a set of values for each salesperson. The shop 
		could compare these groups to identify its most effective staff.</p>
	<p>Conversely, if data were separately collected from different groups of individuals, 
		the resulting data sets could be combined with a categorical variable distinguishing 
		between the groups. For example, the quality control manager in a factory 
		producing light bulbs might want to compare their lifetimes with bulbs produced 
		by two competitors, so lifetimes would be recorded from a sample of bulbs 
		of each type. The three sets of lifetimes might be combined into a single 
		data set with one numerical variable (the lifetimes) and a categorical variable 
		to distinguish the three types of bulb. This type of data set often arises 
		from experiments.</p>
	
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>A categorical variable and groups are often two ways of representing
the same data.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Data presented in a separate list for each group are often called <strong>unstacked</strong> data.
Data presented as a single list alongside a categorical variable are called <strong>stacked</strong> data.</p>

<p class="heading">Rice survey</p>

		<p>As part of a survey of rice producers in Sri Lanka, 36 farmers were randomly 
			selected from 4 villages. The yield of rice (tonnes per hectare) was determined 
			from each farmer.</p>

		<p>The bonuses (percentage of annual salary) paid to 60 lower-level managers
