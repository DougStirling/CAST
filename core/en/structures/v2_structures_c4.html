<p class=heading>Looking for meaningful variables</p>
<p>Sometimes a simple transformation of the raw data that have been collected
	provides a variable whose values are more meaningful or highlight a different
aspect of the data.</p>
		
<div class="diagram">

<p class="heading">GDP in European countries</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/business', 'structures', 'c_europeGdp', '556', '614');</script>

	<p class="heading">European population</p>

<script type='text/javascript'>writeVideo('bk/general', 'structures', 'europeDensity', '574', '626');</script>
		
	<p class="heading">Other examples</p>
	<p>When a quantity is recorded at different times, it is often useful to analyse its percentage change rather than its raw value. For example, mapping the <strong>percentage change</strong> in calorie intake per capita of developing countries highlights the countries that are improving.</p>
	<p>When the values of imports or exports are reported over a series of years, 
		it is usual to take account of inflation by dividing by a price index (e.g. 
		the consumer price index).</p>

<p>Always think carefully about the variables 
					you have been given. Are they accurate? Are there other variables 
					that would be more informative?</p>
