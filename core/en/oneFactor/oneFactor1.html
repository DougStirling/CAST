<p class="heading">Structure of a simple experiment</p>  
  <p>The simplest type of experiment is conducted to assess the effect of a <strong>single factor</strong> on the response. A collection of experimental units is used and  different levels of the factor are allocated <strong>at random</strong> to the experimental units. In many experiments, the same number of experimental units are used for each level of the factor but this is not essential.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
    <p>This type of experimental  is called a <strong>completely randomised experiment</strong>.</p>
  </div></div>
  
  <p>The repeat measurements at each factor level are called <strong>replicates</strong>.</p>
  <p class="heading">When are completely randomised experiments used?</p>
  <p>Completely randomised experiments are mostly used when the experimental units are either very similar or differ in ways that cannot easily be measured before the experiment is conducted. As a result, laboratory and engineering experiments  often use a  completely randomised designs.</p>
  <p>If the experimental units are more variable and we have some information about their structure (e.g. if we can group them into blocks of similar units), there are better experimental designs that will be described in later chapters.</p>
  <p>Even though completely randomised experiments are rarely used in disciplines such as agriculture in which there is structure to the available experimental units,</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>The method of analysis provides a good basis to methods that will be used for more complex experiments in later chapters. </p>

  <p class="heading">Randomisation</p>
	
<p>A key aspect of a completely randomised experiment is the random allocation of treatments to experimental units. The diagram below illustrates this randomisation for an experiment with 6 replicates for each of the 5 factor levels.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Randomise experiment</strong> to randomly allocate the treatments  to experimental units.</p>
<p>Notice that the six replicates of <em>Level 1</em> are equally likely to be used in any six of the experimental units. If the treatments are allocated to the experimental units in any other way, the design is <strong>not</strong> a completely randomised one. For example, if treatments are allocated to ensure that all three units in a row  get the same treatment, the design is not completely randomised and  analysis of the resulting data will not be covered until a later chapter.</p>
<p class="heading">Examples</p>
<p>A few examples of completely randomised experiments are shown below.</p>
