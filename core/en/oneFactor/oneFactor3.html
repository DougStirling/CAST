<p class="heading">A little theory</p>

<p>Both explained and unexplained variation must be taken into account when trying to understand experimental data. The more unexplained variation, the more plausible the scenario that the factor has <strong>no effect</strong> on the response but the observed differences between the treatment means simply arose by chance.</p>
<p>To quantify explained and unexplained variation, we need to specify a <strong>model</strong> for the response that distinguishes them.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>The model that we describe here is the basis of models that are critically important for analysing more complex experiments, so it is important that you fully understand this page.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Response measurements can be of many different types and <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('normalModel2')">several different types of distribution</a> may be appropriate for modelling them. However most common responses can be modelled using normal distributions, so we concentrate here on normal models.</p>
<p class="heading">Model for a completely randomised experiment</p>
<p>One possible model for an experiment with a single controlled factor  specifies that the reponses have independent normal distributions whose parameters depend on the factor level,</p>
<p class="eqn">Level <em>i</em> : &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Y</em>&nbsp; ∼&nbsp; normal (µ<em><sub>i</sub></em><em><sub> </sub></em>, σ<em><sub>i</sub></em>)</p>
<p>In practice, we usually simplify this model with the assumption that the response standard 
  deviation  is the same for all factor levels,</p>

<div class="centred"><div class="boxed percent50">
  <p>Level <em>i</em> : &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Y</em> &nbsp;∼&nbsp; normal (µ<em><sub>i </sub></em>, σ)</p>
</div></div>

<p>This model is flexible enough to be useful for many data sets and reduces the number of unknown parameters to (<i>g</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) &mdash; the <i>g</i> group means, µ<em><sub>i</sub></em>, and the common standard deviation, σ.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<ul>
		<li>Explained variation  is described by differences between the parameters µ<em><sub>i </sub></em>.</li>
		<li>Unexplained variation is described by σ.</li>
	</ul>
	</div></div>
<p class="heading">Alternative notation for model</p>

<p>This model is often expressed in a different way with two suffices representing the level of the factor and the replicate. If factor level <em>i</em> has been used on <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> experimental units (i.e. there are <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> replicates at factor level <em>i</em>), we use the notation <span class="black em">y<sub>ij</sub></span> to denote the <em>j</em>'th of these <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> response values. The above normal model can be written in the alternative form,</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="black em">y<sub>ij</sub></span> &nbsp;= &nbsp;<span class="green">µ<em><sub>i</sub></em></span> &nbsp; + &nbsp; <span class="red">ε<em><sub>ij</sub></em></span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for <em>i</em> = 1 to <em>g</em> and <em>j</em> = 1 to <em>n<sub>i</sub></em></p>
<p>The  term, <span class="eqn red">ε<em><sub>ij</sub></em></span> is called the <strong>error</strong> term in the model. It corresponds to the unexplained variation and is the only random part of the model,</p>
<p class="eqn"><span class="red">ε<em><sub>ij</sub></em></span> &nbsp;∼&nbsp; normal (0<em><sub></sub></em>, σ)</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>This  notation clearly distinguishes explained and unexplained variation and is particularly important when analysing  more complex experiments.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Estimates of the treatment means</p>
<p>The <em>g</em> parameters, <span class="green">µ<sub>1</sub>, µ<sub>2</sub>, ..., µ<em><sub>g</sub></em></span>, describe differences between the factor levels, so they are the most important parameters to estimate.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>The best estimates are the <em>g</em> observed treatment means. </p>
</div></div>

<p>(It is relatively easy to show that these are  <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('normalModel3')">least squares estimates</a> but we will not give the proof here.)</p>
