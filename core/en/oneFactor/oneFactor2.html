<p class="heading">Explained variation</p>

<p>As explained  more fully <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('sec_normalModel')">in the introductory chapter</a>, the concepts of explained and unexplained variation in the response measurement are the basis of analysis of experimental data.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Explained variation</dt>
	<dd>If the controlled factors affect the response, varying their levels increases the variation that is observed in the response.</dd>
	<dt>Unexplained variation</dt>
	<dd>In experimental data, there is always random variation in the response, even if the controlled factors are held constant. Unexplained variation can sometimes be reduced by careful experimental design but can never be eliminated.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In experiments with a single factor, the explained variation is summarised by differences between the response means at the different factor levels (<strong>treatment</strong> means).</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>A table of treatment means is a good summary of the effect of the factor.</p>
</div></div>
<p class="heading">Are the differences real?</p>
<p>Although a table of treatment means provides a good summary, it is incomplete without taking into account the unexplained variation in the data.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
	<p>Could differences between the means have arisen by chance?</p>
</div></div>
<p>We  address this question in later pages of the chapter.</p>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p>The following experiments were described more fully <a href="javascript:showNamedPage('oneFactorIntro3')">in a previous page</a>. In each case, the mean reponses for the treatments summarise their differences.</p>
<p class="heading">Quality of silk</p>
<p>A measure of the quality of reeled silk is its &quot;denier&quot; &mdash; a number expressing the weight of a fixed length. Among many factors that affect denier, the temperature of the bath in which the cocoons are cooked is likely to be important. A completely randomised experiment was conducted with two different bath temperatures, 105°F and 110°F.</p>

<p>In this experiment, there is considerable <strong>unexplained</strong> variation &mdash; with the temperature constant, the range of denier value from cocoon to cocoon is about 50. From these data, it is unclear whether the difference between the two means (<strong>explained</strong> variation) could have arisen by chance &mdash; a formal test is required.</p>
<p class="heading">Hardwood and paper strength</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted to investigate how the hardwood concentration in paper affected its tensile strength. Four concentrations were used (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) and six specimens were made up at each level in a pilot plant. The 24 specimens were tested on a laboratory tensile tester in random order.</p>

</div>

<p>The overall variation in tensile strengths (from the smallest value, 7, to the largest value, 25) is partly caused by differences in hardwood concentration. The differences between the four treatment means (10.00 to 21.17) describe the variation that is <strong>explained</strong> by the treatment. However the six values in each hardwood group vary and this variation is <strong>unexplained</strong> by differences between the hardwood concentrations.</p>
<p class="heading">Effect of copper on aquatic animals</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted to determine how copper concentrations in 
	water affect the lifetime of <em>Daphnia magna</em>, a small aquatic animal. The lifetimes (days) were recorded from fourteen daphnia that were kept in separate containers containing water with different copper levels.</p>
<div class="centred">
	<applet codebase="../../java" code="dataView.CastApplet.class" archive="coreCAST.jar" width="450" height="300">
<script type="text/javascript">writeAppletParams();</script>

	<param name="yAxis" value="20 95 20 10">
	<param name="meanDecimals" value="1">
	</applet>
</div>
<p>The variation between the three treatment means is <strong>explained</strong> by changes to the copper concentration. The variation of lifetimes within each treatment group (e.g. between 60 and 90 days when there is no copper) is <strong>unexplained</strong> by copper concentration.</p></div>
