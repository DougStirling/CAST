<p>Many time series change in cycles, with increases and decreases that cannot 
			be explained by a smooth trend line.</p>
	<p class="heading">Seasonal patterns</p>
	<p>Some cycles are <strong>seasonal</strong>. Seasonal patterns are distinguished by a period that repeats exactly &mdash; for 
		example, monthly data has a period of <strong>exactly</strong> 12 months.</p>
	<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>Seasonal patterns are not usually referred to as 'cyclical'.</p>
	</div></div>
	<p class="heading">Cyclical patterns</p>
	<p>Other cycles  repeat much less regularly. Sun-spot activity
has  cycles of approximately 11 years, and the 'business cycle' can be anywhere
between 3 and 10 years. In both cases, different cycles are not  <strong>exactly</strong> the
same length.</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
		<p>The AR(1) method can be used to obtain forecasts for cyclical data with irregular cycle lengths.</p>
	</div></div>
	<p>We will not distinguish cyclical patterns from other forms of autocorrelation
here.</p>
