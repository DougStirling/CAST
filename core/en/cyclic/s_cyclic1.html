<p class="heading">Autocorrelation of detrended values</p>
	<p>In many time series, there is a tendency for unusually large values 
to be followed by other similar values, even after detrending the series,</p>
<p class=eqn><span class="black"><em>e<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>y<sub>i</sub></em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<em>trend<sub>i</sub></em></span> </p>
	<p>Any tendency for  these residuals to be followed by others of similar size
is called
<strong>autocorrelation</strong> and can be described by the correlation coefficient
between pairs of adjacent residuals.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/s_autoCorr.gif" width="509" height="516"></p>
	<p>In this example, the <strong>autocorrelation</strong> is 0.71, so there is some tendency for values above the trend line to be followed by others on the same side of it.</p>
	<p>Positive autocorrelation has an important impact on forecasting 
		&mdash; if the most recent value is above the trend line, we should forecast 
the next value  will also be above it.</p>
