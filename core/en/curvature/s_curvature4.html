<p class="heading notPrinted">The shape of a relationship is only known around the data</p>
	<p>The models that we have used to describe the relationship between a response, <i>Y</i>, and explanatory variable, <i>X</i>, are usually only approximations to
		the 'real' relationship. For example, a scatterplot may <strong>look</strong> linear,
		but we really have no information about the shape of the relationship beyond our data. </p>
	<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../curvature/images/extrapolate.gif" width="256" height="166">
	<p>A model may be useful for predicting <i>Y</i> from values of <i>X</i> that are within the range of x-values in our data, but we
		should be very cautious about using it to predict <em>Y</em> outside this range.
		This is called <strong>extrapolation</strong> and it can be badly in error. </p>
