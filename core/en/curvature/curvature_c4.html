<p class="heading">The shape of a relationship is only known around the data</p>
  <p>The models that we have used to describe the relationship between a response, 
    <i>Y</i>, and explanatory variable, <i>X</i>, are usually only approximations 
    to the 'real' relationship. For example, a scatterplot may <strong>look</strong> 
    linear, but we really have no information about the shape of the relationship 
    beyond our data. </p>
  <p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../curvature/images/extrapolate.gif" width="256" height="166"> 
<p>As a result, the models that we have described may be used to predict <i>Y</i> 
    from values of <i>X</i> that are within the range of x-values in our data, 
    but we should be very cautious about using a fitted model for predictions 
    outside this range. This is called <strong>extrapolation</strong> and it can 
    be badly in error. </p>
  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Avoid using a model to predict <em>Y</em> far beyond the available 
        data.</p>
</div></div>

  <p class="heading">What model for curvature is best?</p>
  <p>We described two different types of nonlinear model for data with curvature 
    &mdash; quadratic models and linear models based on transformed variables. There 
    are many data sets for which both types of model fit equally well.</p>
  <p>However the different types of model can give very different predictions 
    when used to extrapolate from the observed data. The data cannot help us to 
    decide which is better.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: GDP in the USA">
		<p class="heading">GDP in the USA</p>

		<p>For example, consider the time series of GDP (measured in billion dollars, 
			corrected for inflation by being expressed in 2006 dollar terms) in the 
			USA between 1960 and 2013.</p>
		<p>We saw earlier that a quadratic model fitted well. In terms of an explanatory 
			variable <i>t</i> that we define to be the year minus 1960 (so that 1960 
			is year <i>t</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, 1061 is year <i>t</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ...) the least 
			squares curve is </p>
	
	  <p class=eqn><strong>estimate of GDP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;3186.6 + 122.26 <em>t</em> + 2.400 <em>t</em><sup>2</sup> </p>
	
<p>The logarithm of the pressure is also approximately linearly related
to boiling point with the equation
</p>
	
	  <p class=eqn><strong>estimate of </strong>ln<strong> (GDP)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;8.143 + 0.0308 <em>t</em> </p>

	<p>This equation can be rewritten in the form
	</p>

	  <p class=eqn><strong>estimate of GDP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;exp( 8.143 + 0.0308 <em>t</em> ) </p>

		<p>The two models (quadratic in the original measurements and linear in the 
			transformed measurements) both fit the data reasonably well with residual 
			plots that are similar. The data give no indication of which of the alternative 
			models fits better. </p>

<p>Use the pull-down menu to display the two fitted lines (<strong>Quadratic model</strong>
and <strong>Log linear model</strong>). Observe that they both fit the data reasonably well.
</p>

		<p>Select the option <strong>Both models</strong>, then use the slider to 
			extend the two axes. Before about 1940 and after about 2020, the two models 
			give very different predictions of GDP. </p>

		<p>Indeed, the quadratic model (which is green) predicts that GDP would have 
			been <strong>higher</strong> in 1920 than in 1940, which is clearly unreasonalbe! 
			For these data, the log linear model conforms better to how we might expect 
			GDP to have changed in the past. </p>

		<p>However we really have little idea about which curve is better in the future&mdash; 
      indeed, <strong>neither</strong> may adequately predict GDP. The point here 
      is that...</p>
