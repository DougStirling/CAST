<p class="heading">The shape of a relationship is only known around the data</p>

<p>The models that we have used to describe the relationship between a response,
<i>Y</i>, and explanatory variable, <i>X</i>, are usually only approximations to
the 'real' relationship. For example, a scatterplot may <strong>look</strong> linear,
but we really have no information about the shape of the relationship beyond our data.
</p>

<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="../curvature/images/extrapolate.gif" width="256" height="166">

<p>As a result, the models that we have described may be used to predict <i>Y</i>
from values of <i>X</i> that are within the range of x-values in our data, but we
should be very cautious about using a fitted model for predictions outside this range.
This is called <strong>extrapolation</strong> and it can be badly in error.
</p>

  
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
<p>Avoid using a model to predict <em>Y</em> far beyond the available 
        data.</p>

  <p class="heading">What model for curvature is best?</p>
  <p>We described two different types of nonlinear model for data with curvature 
    &mdash; quadratic models and linear models based on transformed variables. There 
    are many data sets for which both types of model fit equally well.</p>
  <p>However the different types of model can give very different predictions 
    when used to extrapolate from the observed data. The data cannot help us to 
    decide which is better.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Example: Atmospheric pressure and boiling point">
<p class="heading">Forbes' data</p>

<p>One such data set is the Forbes data, for which we hope to describe the relationship
between barometric pressure, <i>Y</i>, and the boiling point of water, <i>X</i>.
</p>

<p>We saw earlier that a quadratic model fitted well; the least squares curve is
</p>
	
	<p class=eqn><strong>estimate of pressure</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;116.59 &minus; 1.4165 <em>x</em> + 0.004752 <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>
	</p>
	
<p>The logarithm of the pressure is also approximately linearly related
to boiling point with the equation
</p>
	
	<p class=eqn><strong>estimate of </strong>ln<strong> (pressure)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&minus;0.9518 + 0.02052 <em>x</em>
	</p>

	<p>This equation can be rewritten in the form
	</p>

	<p class=eqn><strong>estimate of pressure</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;exp( &minus;0.9518 + 0.02052 <em>x</em> )
	</p>

<p>The two models (quadratic in the original measurements and linear in the transformed
measurements) both fit the data equally well with residual plots that are almost identical.
The data give no indication of which of the alternative models fits better.

<p>Use the pull-down menu to display the two fitted lines (<strong>Quadratic model</strong>
and <strong>Log linear model</strong>). Observe that they almost coincide.
</p>

<p>Select the option <strong>Both models</strong>, then use the slider to extend the
two axes. When the boiling point is less than approximately 150 degrees, or more
than 250 degrees, the two models give very different predictions of the pressure.
</p>

<p>Indeed, the quadratic model (which is green) predicts that the pressure will
<strong>increase</strong> when the boiling point falls below 150 degrees, which
does not conform to physics! For these data, the log linear model is likely to
give better predictions at low boiling points.
</p>

    <p>However we really have little idea about which curve is better at high 
      boiling points &mdash; indeed, <strong>neither</strong> may adequately predict 
      pressure. The point here is that...</p>
