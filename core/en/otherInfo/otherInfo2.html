<p class="heading">List of pages</p>
<p>For any chapter, you can display a heirarchical list of its sections and pages in a separate browser window. By default, a line or two of summary about each page is displayed, but a check-box allows these summaries to be hidden.</p>
<p>This list can either be printed directly from the browser or copied and pasted into a word processor such as Microsoft Word for further formatting.</p>
<p class="heading">Summary pages</p>
<p>If the current e-book contains summary versions of its pages, it is possible to display the complete summary version of any chapter in a single page that is formatted for printing.</p>
<p>You can print directly from the browser, but for a few e-books, we have prepared PDF versions of these summary chapters on our server that are laid out for printing 2-pages per sheet of paper.</p>

<p class="heading">Printing the summary pages</p>
<p>Many of the CAST e-books contain summary versions of their pages. For the public introductory e-books, these summary pages have been compiled into PDF files in a 4-per-page format for printing. This has also been done for some customised e-books.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin:0px">
<td><p>If PDF versions of the book's summary chapters have been created, a pop-up menu on the right of the banner will give you access to them.</p></td>
<td><img src="../../structure/images/options.png" width="56" height="58"/></td>
</table>

<p>If you select one of these chapters from the menu, its summary PDF will be displayed in your default web browser and can be downloaded or printed from there.</p>
