<p class="heading">Sum of two identically distributed variables</p>

<p>We now concentrate on the sum of <strong>two</strong> independent random quantities 
with identical distributions &mdash; e.g. a random sample of size 2 from a distribution 
with mean µ 
and standard deviation σ. 
From the formulae on the previous page, this has mean and standard deviation:</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/sum2Distn.gif" width="119" height="50"></p>
<p class="heading">Sum of two variables with different means</p>
<p>We now generalise by allowing <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> to have different means, µ<sub>1</sub> and µ<sub>2</sub>, 
  but the same standard deviation. Their sum has a distribution with the same spread 
  as above, but the formula for the mean must be generalised:</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/sum2Distn2.gif" width="146" height="47"> </p>
<p class="heading">Difference between two variables</p>
<p>A similar result holds for the difference between <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> 
and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>. If they both have standard deviation σ, their difference has the same standard deviation as their sum (but the distribution has a different mean):</p>
<p class=eqn><img class="gif" src="images/diff2Distn2.gif" width="146" height="47"></p>


<p class="heading">Shape of distribution</p>
<p>If <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> are independent and have normal distributions,  their sum and difference are also normally distributed.</p>
<p>If <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> have distributions with different shapes, their sum and difference usually have distributions that are non-normal but are <strong>closer to normal</strong> than the two source distributions. However the above formula for the mean and standard deviation hold whatever the shapes of the distributions of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>

<div class="diagram" title="Simulation to illustrate distributions">
<p class="heading">Illustration</p>
<p>The top of the diagram below shows the distributions of two normal variables, <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>. The longer vertical red lines above each distribution can be dragged to adjust their means; dragging the shorter red lines changes the common standard deviation.</p>

<p>The bottom of the diagram shows the distribution of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>X</em><sub>2</sub>. Note that its mean is µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;µ<sub>2</sub> and its standard deviation is √2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.414 times that of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>. Change the means and standard deviations of <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub> (by dragging the vertical red lines) and verify that this result holds whatever their distributions.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Accumulate</strong> then click <strong>Take sample</strong> a few times to select pairs of random values 
  from the two distributions. Observe that the distributions conform reasonably to the theoretical distributions.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Difference</strong> from the pop-up menu and repeat with the difference between <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>. Note in particular that:</p>
<div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  <p>If µ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;µ<sub>2</sub>, then <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>X</em><sub>2</sub> has a normal distribution with <strong>mean zero</strong>. </p>
