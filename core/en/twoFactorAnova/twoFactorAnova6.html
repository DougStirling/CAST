<p class="heading">Formulae for sums of squares in orthogonal designs</p>
<p>For orthogonal designs, the explained sums of squares for the two factors have relatively simple formulae that  help to explain their interpretation.</p>
<p>We again use the notation <span class="black em"> y<sub>ijk</sub></span> to denote the <em>k</em>'th of the replicates for which factor X is at level <em>i</em> and factor Z is at level <em>j</em>. If  the overall mean response is denoted by <em> <img src="images/yMean.gif" width="13" height="18" align="absmiddle"></em> and  the mean response when X is at level <em>i</em> is <em><img src="images/yMeanX.gif" width="14" height="19" align="absmiddle"></em> then the sum of squares explained by X is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/SSX.gif" width="136" height="39"></p>
<p>where the summation is over all experimental units. This sum of squares  therefore measures the differences between the mean response at different levels of X.</p>
<p>In a similar way, if the mean response when Z is at level <em>j</em> is <em><img src="images/yMeanZ.gif" width="17" height="22" align="absmiddle"></em>, then the sum of squares explained by Z is</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/SSZ.gif" width="136" height="39"></p>
<p>and it describes summarises how much the mean response varies between the different levels of Z.<br>
