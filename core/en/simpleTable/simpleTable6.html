<p class="heading">Multi-column tables</p>

  
<p>Many published tables are more complex than the simple tables that we have 
described earlier in this section. However they often consist of several simpler 
tables combined together. Often each column is a simple table.</p>
  
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">Regional statistics for Tanzania</p>

<p>The table below was published by the National Bureau of Statistics in Tanzania 
in 2003 to summarise differences between the regions of the country.</p>
<p class="eqn"><img src="images/tanzaniaTable.png" width="683" height="581" alt=""/></p>
<p>We have coloured the columns of land areas and population. The regional populations 
	form a frequency table and the areas are also a partition of the total area of 
	the country. The totals are shown in the top row of the table and an extra row 
	has been added with the mainland total (excluding Zanzibar).</p>
<p>We also highlighted the overall age distribution in yellow. These three percentages 
also summarise a frequency table, though the raw population counts have not been 
presented in the table. The values for these three columns in the other rows of 
the table similarly summarise frequency tables for the age distributions in the 
regions.</p>
<p>None of the remaining columns are partitions of a total. For example, the sum 
of the population growth rates for two regions, or the sum of their household 
sizes are not values that could be interpreted. The overall values for the whole 
of Tanzania in the top row of the table cannot be found in a simple way from the 
values in the regions.</p>
</div>

  
<p>It can sometimes be harder to identify parts of a table that are frequency 
tables or other partions.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>It is important to recognise frequency tables and partitions. 
Some graphical displays should only be used for them.</p></div>

<br>
<div class="diagram"> 
<p class="heading">UN survey responses</p>

<p>The United Nations conducted a survey about the extent to which countries 
implemented a set of 'Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics' in 
their National Statistics Offices. The table below was published in a UN 
report and describes which countries were sent questionnaires (the recipients) 
and which ones returned the questionnaires (respondents).</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#999999">
<tr> 
	
<td><img src="../freqTable/images/unRespondentsBottomTable.gif" width="524" height="349"></td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>Finally, note that the values in the bottom right do not form a frequency table 
either.</p>
<div class="centred"><table border="0" class="centred" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#999999">
<tr> 
	
<td><img src="../freqTable/images/unResponseRates.gif" width="524" height="349"></td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>When there are only 2 categories, a single value (such as the response rate 
of 81% here) adequately summarises the frequency table, so the column of response 
rates in the published table is a concise summary.</p>

<div class="boxed"><p>A column of percentages does not always imply a frequency 
table.</p></div>
