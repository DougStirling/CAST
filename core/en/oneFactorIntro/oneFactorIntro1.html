<p class="heading">Purpose</p>  
  <p>Experiments are conducted to discover how certain variables that can be controlled 
    by the experimenter affect the values of one or more 'response' variables.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How does storage temperature affect the texture of ice cream?</li>
    <li>Does the addition of a food colouring affect bacteria counts in yoghurt?</li>
    <li>How does the spacing of cabbage plants affect their weight per head?</li>
    <li>Does the firing temperature affect the density or hardness of a certain 
      type of brick?</li>
    <li>Which of several feed supplements improves weight gain of chickens most?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is important that the <strong>objectives</strong> are clearly defined in terms of response and controlled variables before going further in the design of an experiment.</p>
  <p class="heading">Experimental units</p>
  <p>Experiments usually involve discrete 'experimental units'. Depending on the 
    type of experiment, the experimental units could be:</p>
	
  <ul>
    <li>distinct items such as people, animals or plants</li>
    <li>quantities of some 'substance' such as volumes of yoghurt or areas (plots) 
      of land</li>
    <li>repetitions (or runs) of some process that can be repeated under different 
      conditions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There may be some known structure to the experimental units &mdash; for example, the people may have different ages or the plots of land may be in different parts of a farm with different soils or drainage.</p>
  <p>The  experimental units that will be used in an experiment are first selected. One or more <strong>response</strong> measurements will be made from each unit during the course of the experiment. </p>
  <p class="heading">Controlled variables</p>
  <p>In an experiment, the researcher is able to control the values of one or more variables that  can potentially influence what happens to the  unit during the course of the experiment. Simple experiments only have a single controlled variable 
 	but many experiments involve several variables that are controlled.</p>
  <p> The controlled variables in an experiment are determined by its objectives  and are called<strong> factors</strong>. They may be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>numerical, such as temperature or quantity of a chemical additive</li>
    <li>categorical, such as different processing methods or different emzymes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For each individual factor, its distinct values are called its <strong>levels</strong>.</p>
  <p>In some experiments, the 'control' of an explanatory variable may arise only 
  	through the choice of experimental units. For example, in an experiment with 
  	animals, it may be decided to use 10 males and 10 females, in which case gender 
  	would be treated as a categorical explanatory variable.</p>
  <p class="heading">Design</p>
  <p>The <strong>combination</strong> of levels for <strong>all</strong> factors that are used with any experimental unit are collectively called a <strong>treatment</strong> and we say that the experimenter can control which treatment to <strong>apply</strong> to each experimental unit.</p>
  <p>In a simple experiment with a single controlled factor, the treatments are simply the factor levels. However in an experiment that controls the amounts of three trace elements (P, Na and Mg) applied to tomato plants, each possible <strong>combination of levels of the three elements</strong>  is a separate treatment.</p>
  <div class="centred"><div class="boxed">
  	<p>The <strong>experimental design</strong> is the method used to decide which treatment to apply to each experimental unit. </p>
  </div></div>
  <p class="heading">Response variable</p>
  <p>One or more response measurements are made from each experimental unit, the measurements being dictated by the objectives of the experiment. The experiment aims to discover whether  each factor
  affects the responses and, if so, by how much.</p>
  <p>Although  advanced methods exist to simultaneously analyse several response measurements, it is usually sufficient to examine the effects of the factors on each response separately.</p>
