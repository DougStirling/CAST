<p class="heading">Browsers</p>
<p>CAST works with   releases of Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari at the time of writing this (late 2016) but the browser-based version of CAST will stop working in <strong>all</strong> browsers at some time in the future. We therefore recommend that CAST is downloaded and the stand-alone version of CAST is used instead.</p>
<p>A recent version of Java is needed to display the interactive diagrams in CAST. When a CAST e-book is started, a check is made for whether Java is installed; if your computer fails the Java check, the &quot;full&quot; versions of pages will not be displayed. (You may however still be able to browse the summary and video versions of pages if the e-book has them.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately Java cannot be installed on  tablet computers so the interactive diagrams  cannot be used on them.)</p>
<p class="heading">Alternative versions of pages</p>
<p>In some of the pages within the CAST e-books, you will  see a small triangle on the top right. This is a menu from which you can dispay alternative versions of the same page -- perhaps with a biological, business or climatic example.</p>

<div id="lecture" style="display:none">
<p>The main CAST e-books were designed for self-study, but the interactive diagrams are  also useful for explaining concepts in lectures. To make this easier for lecturers, three special e-books have been created containing only the interactive diagrams (applets) from the introductory e-books without the surrounding text. The diagrams are larger than those in the student e-books and a button is provided to give advice on usage of each diagram.</p>
<p>To use the lecturing e-books, select the <strong>e-books</strong> tab then click <strong>Applets for lecturers</strong>.</p>

<div id="toc" style="display:none">
<p>For most CAST e-books that contain summary pages, these can be printed using a menu on the right of the banner. The method differs depending on whether you are using the stand-alone version of CAST or are viewing the e-book in a browser. In both cases, the summary pages for each chapter have been packaged into a PDF that is formatted for easy printing.</p>

<p class="heading"><a href='javascript:expandHeading("customised")' class="expandLink" onMouseover='hiliteArrow("customised", true)' onMouseout='hiliteArrow("customised", false)'>Customised and translated e-books <img src="images/closedArrow.gif" id="customisedArrow" align="absbottom" style="border-width:0px;"></a></p>
<div id="customised" style="display:none">
<p>It is  possible to create  CAST e-books with a different selection and ordering of material. For example, the author has produced customised e-books to accompany  various courses at his own university and  for  external groups and companies.</p>
<p><em>A program and documentation have been written to simplify the customisation process. A customised e-book can be created with only this program and an HTML editor.</em></p>
<p>In a similar way, it is possible to create CAST e-books in other languages, though the process is a little more complex for a complete translation that includes text in static and interactive diagrams.</p>
<p>If you are interested in creating a customised or translated e-book, please <a href="mailto:d.stirling@massey.ac.nz">contact the author</a>.</p>
